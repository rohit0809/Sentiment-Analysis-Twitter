Not Happy 
Nice but broke due to recoil on AK-74 
Uh... 
Had to modify to make it accurate 
Front gas block sight 
AR 
Looks great does not work on H&R Pardner Protector 
Too expensive for a toy and worthless for any halfway serious shooters. 
Works but nothing to tell your friends about.....for the price it works. 
Things should work when new. 
What easy install? 
Not for Real Firearm Use 
Not universal - Remington 870 fitment problem 
PAINTBALL ONLY RAIL 
UTG Universal Single-Rail Barrel Mount with 2 Picatinny Slots 
Don't overpay for cheap items or pay to return bad units

Maybe for some guns 
Not needed for a Benjamin Trail NP .22 Pellet Rifle 
Not for duty use 
Not very useful 
meh 
Two Stars

Not what I expected 
Avoid for hunting use. Air soft quality. 
Nice low profile bipod 
Wobble baby wobble (FAIL) 
Better products out there 
Does not stay tight not really usable 
UTG Bipod Adjustable height LOL 
Not are well made as I would have liked 
Airsoft junk 
short and smelly 
Not really the greatest 
Too short for rifle iron sights - barely tall enough with scope 
scratched and used 
slanted 
Nice But 
Center screw came loose after only 20 shots 
TOO SHORT 
Dissapointing 
Better than nothing but hardy a good bipod 
Buy a better one. 
WAY TO SMALL!! FOR AK47 OR BIG MAGS 
Flimsy.  Don't waste $20 unless  going to mount it on a .22 LR or BB gun. 
Isn't perfect out of the box modification is needed 
Bi-pod Can be Easily Fixed 
Crap!!! 
Bipod kept getting loose 
Not for higher caliper weapons 
Worthless for High Power Weapons. 
Not good for high caliber rifles

Far too expensive for something that can leak 
difficult to use 
If you like a wet chain then this is for you. 
Brakes+lube=poor modulation 
Poor design... 
Does what it is supposed to do but! 
Spend the extra money and get the Down East 1606 Frame 
You decide 
Beware of the packaging 
Folded and Creased 
Very bummed. 
Great fit distorts vision severely 
I don't care for these

This watch has a fatal flaw: it uses a fixed step/stride length & you can't change it! 
I Wanted To Love This! 
Bulky for Smaller Wrists Not  Accurate 
Time Works Pedometer and Heart Rate A Little Iffy 
Has some flaws 
Love the idea but don't get accurate step counts

I may not be smart enough for this one 
Its a One-Way Tracker 
soso

As noisy as an F-1 race car or Space Shutter takeoff. 
great design ruined by lousy welding 
Funny photo 
false advertising 
Beautiful -- but heavy dribbly and leaky 
It's a Falling Star for Me--Started 5 Stars Then 4 Now 2

Way too small! 
Not a workout short. Maybe bloomers 
Too small 
Cheap but wear protection 
Eh. 
What can I say...

Tried ... 
this would be a great mount for an airsoft gun. 
My luck... 
lack of support 
Tight on my nugget. 
Small 
High quality just doesn't work that great 
Retuning The Unit 
too much stray cotton 
Comfortable but lens is fragile at the nose bridge 
It's a tight fit 
WARNING :THE LARGE SIZE IS LIKE A SMALL

I tried it and I will stay with the brands I've been buying good for price but can find same for less I think. 
cheap 
Very thin and drab absorbs good but holds little 
needs work 
Holds Small to Medium Size Pistols only (beretta nano ... 
Poor craftsmanship 
Okay spend the money and get a good one. 
Not for me but product is as described 
Less than expected 
you get what you pay for 
Waste of Money 
Solid but Poorly Designed 
Too short 
Good Idea...Poor Execution! 
Had to manually adjust the piece 
I see way too many stars given for these gloves...maybe a sinky sweaty one slipped off and knocked me in the head 
Doesn't hold up 
This phone is not a good phone 
Nice phone 
More weight than can be safely used. 
Product is fine; product description somewhat deceitful 
I guess I just had a bad shipment. 
Waist band is waaaaay too tight 
Not for running 
not picatinny 
A challenge to set up 
This was a waste of money 
The Best? - not for the near sighted 
Objects - cars - just too small in this mirror

Cannot touch screen 
Not very functional 
definitely for the novice 
Tactical light 
Too short 
Way over priced 
I wish I did not buy this safe 
You get what you pay for! 
Not as good as just doing push-ups and uncomfortable as well. 
Great idea to help you do more efficient push ups but not for full chest 
Unsafe plate poor chest support crude one-size-fits-all design 
You will hurt yourself 
A good idea needs some fine tuning--is possibly dangerous to use 
Yet another pointless piece of exercise equipment 
I think I'll stick with the floor 
Another Home Fitness Device That Overpromises A Total Body Workout

OK if you can bare to live without the trigger safety not for me !!! 
Looks great doesn't fit. 
Decent mat but... 
Well below average....... 
Not a Good Value - \Drugstore\ Cotton Swabs Do Not Break As Easily 
Just doesn't quite do it. 
It did not fit my barrel. I would have ... 
not a barrel mount 
Not a big fan 
not a tru see-thru lift. 
Better Choices

It will hold your gun 
My fault for believing the hype 
Doesn't compare 
Tight on my biceps

Bright and cheap but not hassle free 
Just ok 
Cheap looking and feel 
Bent 
poor fit

Junk 
Doesn't Fit Kimber Needs Special Screw Driver 
good for price but aligns loosely

okeba inaccurate laser boresight 
poor product 
not very useful... 
laser not straight 
Too erratic to use 
Too bulky 
OK good weight but might be too pricey

Fun as a toy; useless if you are expecting accuracy 
Fairly useless unless you like soccer or football speeds! 
Not Very Accurate 
Novelty item...not for serious athletic application 
Overpriced Toy 
Not accurate but also not $1000+ ... 
Only useful as a toy
