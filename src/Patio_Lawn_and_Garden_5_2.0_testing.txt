Safer BUT !!!!! 
Two Stars 
Not for Sugar Ants 
Disappearing leaves 
I expected a bit better for the price 
Not Really for Weeding 
Just can't justify the price 
If it would only turn on 
how long will it last? 
Waste 
Don't get rid of the cat! 
Mouse in the House Maybe? 
Great housing for your mice 
Easy to use but not super practical 
good idea not so good design 
It is all wonderful except... 
Easy to use but.... 
Disappointed. 
A lot of plastic to kill a small mouse 
Generally Ineffective.....Use Only If Your THAT Squeamish 
Complex Solution To A Simple Problem 
They Didn't Build A Better Mouse Trap 
Driving mice to the regular traps 
Kill and Seal Trap 0 Wood Trap 4.... 
Mixed thoughts -- 
Love Victor but not these. 
limited usefulness 
A coffin made of plastic at 4.00 a pop 
Unimpressed. Sticking with classic trap instead. 
Broken On Delivery 
Negatives Outweigh The Positives 
Too Little Power - Returned to Amazon for Refund 
Waste of money 
Disappointed in quality 
this is an ok product 
Disappointing 
Easy to use but didn't kill all the ants 
Disappointing outdoors 
Carpenter ants came back 
Exceeded 
NEMO--- and smaller storms 
Built to be disposable 
Electronic Pest Repeller 
Too Much Debris! 
This did not attract any birds! 
Vacs up liquid sure but doesn't really clean 
The straight up 
HUGE gloves and not truly puncture resistent 
Not impressed. 
Didn't work at all on my lawn 
Spectracide 32oz Weed Stop Concentrate 
Overrun with snails 
Didn't seem to hold up. 
Horrible Packaging 
Hummers Not Interested 
SO disappointed! 
Way too small 
OK - I prefer to pull pork with forks. 
The trap wouldn't close 
It plainly doesn't work because it cannot keep away small pests. 
Not good for large garden. maybe good for small garden. 
lasted 3 seasons 
Not up to expectations 
Food gone but mouse happy and well fed 
Nothing Like The picture 
Not for squirrels even small ones 
Didn't work on rats 
It's harder to trip than it should be 
Not So Good For the Chippies 
Jack of all trades Master of none 
Weak 
Works ok but... 
Zero moths. 
Did not work for me 
King-Size Highwood Adirondack Chair - Weathered Acorn 
Don't get 
Probe Went Bad On Second Cook 
Weak battery 
Pot Filler 
beware of where the mice will die 
Not the one I'd choose. Here's a summary of them all: 
Can't use it if you have pets 
Clonex 
Too much money for what you get 
Lava Rocks are a Better Alternative 
Why pay for this when you can use other materials cheaper? 
Performs Well for Light Duty Cleaning 
Poisonous for pets and kids 
Mice ignored it if they die they do so elsewhere.  Poison is lethal to pets. 
Not recommended  the poisoned mouse can be eaten by pets... 
Too scared my cats or hens will eat the mice poisoned with this 
Misleading 
Are you kidding me? 
Expensive and only so-so solution 
Genius?!? 
Not worth the price 
It makes the flower pot marginally lighter 
Wouldn't buy again 
Many Dead upon arrival 
About half of the bugs were dead 
These are not native lady bugs and they bite. 
Requires Lots of Scrubbing 
Barely helped at all. 
too many problems 
Didn't remove mold from our house siding 
Even elbow  grease is not enhanced with this product. 
Krud Kutter HS01 Green Pressure Washer Concentrate House and Siding Cleaner 
Krud Kutter 
Line feed doesn't work edging is horrible 
I would urge you to avoid this product! 
Heavy and unwieldy with auto-feed that will not feed - buy another brand 
Just frustrating. 
Mine was defective dead website - who makes this thing actually? 
Died after about a year. 
Not impressed. 
Damaged sofa not once but twice:( 
Top of table has way too much \give\ 
A dissatisfied customer 
Doesn't blow hard enough and battery has poor life 
Battery is fine the rest is the problem 
My skunks are too smart for this trap! 
Not a better mouse trap... 
there should be more painless solutions for discouraging mice from entering the house 
Not impressed so far 
Maybe its me but it doesn't work. 
It works...but the big drawback is the delayed death 
Dud 
Had difficulty setting it 
Haven't caught anything - snap traps still the best 
Hard to push for less strong people 
meh 
My kids like the idea that there is a mouse catcher so that you can catch and release. 
Useless 
Clever but ineffective 
You have to keep checking it if you do not want mice duels to the death. 
Mole Teaser 
not as good as my old metal ones . . . .. 
Hasn't work yet! 
Maybe too sensitive for our sandy soil? 
Not working here 
The moles are winning 
Mole Trap 
Not impressed 
too small 
Lightweight but not at all powerful 
Mice did not like but if they do take bait they die elsewhere which could be not a pleasant experience. 
like all poison this might fall into the wrong mouths 
Not advisable if you have pets and/or kids 
Don't Change Things That Are Perfect! 
Decreased control from too much length weight 
Nothing keeps the deer out of my garden! 
So far the birds don't use it 
Looks nice enough but not too functional 
Started to rust in two days 
Better suited as a log holder or for magazine storage 
Attractive Design 
I hope they gave a bonus to the person that invented the spreader 
Says it's safe for the veggie garden but not safe on your skin... 
Looks better than it is 
meh... 
Cute but Ultimately it's For the Birds 
Form inhibits function. Birds were slow to adapt but eventually enthusiastic. Inconvenient for me 
Cute idea poor execution 
Not easy to fill & only small birds can fit on the perch 
No customers 
Water Cooler for Small Birds 
Attractive to humans! 
Impractical Design 
*Update* 
Clever Design but This Hummingbird Feeder Eventually Leaked 
Had to downgrade it. 
First one was junk; long awaited replacement was better. 
it is not really working 
Great solution in very precise circumstances 
didn't work but another product from the same company did 
It's Not Working 
Time-Consuming Process 
Just no. 
Not yet... 
Not Really Any Difference 
Spray Application Repellent 
Sprayer designed cheap small crack = worthless. 
Another Mole Treatment Failure 
Great Design Trumped By Poor Quality 
Lacking the quality to be a good product. 
Not safe - at all. 
Too  Tiny 
not great 
Three dead mice? 
Not a better mousetrap 
Expensive and did not catch anything but snap trap did! 
To be an improvement it has to be better than the conventional snap trap... 
Haven't caught those critters yet 
After a whole year - not a single catch! 
Cheaply made & very small! 
Not big enough! 
Not very useful 
Not what I hoped it would be 
Good idea gone bad 
Doesn't seem to bother our snakes 
Sigh... It doesn't seem to work on Virginia raccoons 
Just OK 
didn't work for me 
Raccoons and foxes appeared more not less after application 
Didn't bother the cat 
It didn't work for my cats--they still lay all over my flower beds. 
Ortho 490210 Ready to Use Dog and Cat-B-Gon Dog and Cat Repellent 
This product needs to be re-applied after rain 
Flowers and Kerosene Smell 
Title is Misleading 
Convenient but broke pretty quickly 
Extremely high water pressure in an extremely low pressure hose. 
I loved this but it is a piece of garbage. 
Wasn't too sure of it but so far so good... UPDATE!!! 
Sprung a leak on the sixth (light) use 
Disappointing performance 
Didn't meet even basic expectations 
Frustrating first use 
Only 75 feet if you let the pressure build up 
What can I say... 
Expanding hose 
Does not expand as promised. Not good for many applications 
Lightweight but does not last 
Still waiting ..and waiting ..and waiting :( 
It Worked & Then It Didn't 
Maybe someplace that's NOT Alaska? 
User interface sensor responsiveness and fit/finish issues... 
Design Flaws ~ Awkward Top and Easy to Spill Seed 
Great Company but they missed on this one. 
Made In China 
This is NOT a \Squirrel Proof\ feeder.  See review for better options. 
Quality Construction But Very Frustrating Top And Far From \Maximum Security From Squirrels\ 
Bottom part too easy for squirrels to open and an update 
Very nice squirrel feeder! Keeps out only very low-IQ squirrels... 
Cheap imitation of the Squirrel Buster 
A poorly designed feeder that should be recalled 
Where are the birds? 
Bad Design 
Perky Pet Squirrel Slammer Bird Feeder 
No Birds At This Feeder Speaks Volumes 
Not bird-approved... 
Not durable 
squirrel AND bird proof! 
Squirrels can't get to the food but neither can the birds.  But works great AFTER a major alteration 
Attractive but they like my red glass perch-less feeder better 
My hummers avoid this feeder 
Mixed Feelings About This Feeder 
what a let down 
I don't think they like it 
Beautiful design cheap construction hanger too short! 
Hmmm... 
A small step up 
Window Planter 
Nice concept but falls short 
Stability and Width an Issue. 
I wanted to like this product but.... 
It works but it's a ripoff at current price 
If Not a Gift... 
Failed the first test of an insect killer 
Expensive and anemic 
Not great--look around for something else 
Good idea...  Sorry to say mine is just not dependable in daily use... 
Keeps the rabbits out of the garden! 
Unrealiable And Short Lived Solar Power...Expensive. 
Did not last 
Foam gone = good stink smell = not good... 
Gets rid of foam but leaves residue 
Reduces foam but makes the water smell badly and look cloudy 
Not thrilled 
A very expensive route to a teeny tiny garden 
I guess I have a black thumb 
Seemed to Dry Out Without Germination; I Guess I Do Not Have a Green Thumb 
I'm not impressed but I suppose some might like it. 
Great Those Just Starting in Gardening - But Expensive! 
It didn't grow....a tomato plant I think 
More of a science project than an herb garden 
Miracle-Gro 17002S Gro-Ables Salad and Herb Garden Kit 
You'll have a better easier garden if you buy starts at a garden center 
Questionable value 
A Mixed Bag 
Very humane indeed! 
Critter only went in; when unit was off 
Clumsy to use and only half way effective 
Not recommended 
The quality of this hose is questionable compared to others. 
Works well if at a low pressure but sure to break 
Second one I have had - lasted 4 weeks in total... 
Great without the weight 
Cool Idea/Problematic Design 
Birds Don't Like It But the Squirrels Do! 
I Don't Need A Squirrel Feeder 
Perky-Pet B00303 Fly-Through Wild Bird Feeder 
Not a good design 
Nice-looking  . . . but looks better than it works 
Not worth the cost or effort 
Somewhat aesthetically appealing not so much functionally 
Nice idea; poor execution 
Frequent jams. 
Much bother and gizmos 
Maybe we just don't have a green thumb... 
Not well engineered 
Bad joke? 
Good concept poor execution 
Perky-Pet 253 Oriole Jelly Wild Bird Feeder 
Much corner cutting frustrating documentation more expensive to operate than expected 
Not User Friendly & Not Worth The $ 
This University Extension Master Gardener is not impressed 
Too limited too expensive and not needed 
Not a good value 
The squirrels loved it the birds not so much 
Squirrel Bait 
not that good of feeder 
Updated Review. Great Squirrel Feeder. 
not the best feeder out there 
Not worth it 
Suitable under some but probably not most conditions 
flat back and top is too easy for squirrels to open 
It's flimsy and it leaks... 
Bear Waterer 
Concept Great Execution Poor 
Great idea bad execution 
Too fussy 
good idea but so-so design 
Leaks out like a sieve. 
One step above junk 
No Ants!---with this one. ** Changing my rating...sad! 
Too much \junk\ 
Neither positive or negative results 
Not too impressed 
Not for me 
Not ready for prime time 
This is a difficult product to review because of the assembly issues! 
Update - it lasted 2 weeks and then the blade bent 90 degrees on a root - a real shame 
too light not heavy duty enough for a grill cover. 
Other brands I'll compare here are a better value 
Big Lightweight Grill Cover 
Velcro straps pulled right off!
