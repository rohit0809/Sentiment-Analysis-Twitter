Just Didn't Hold Up At All 
Smaller than I envisioned 
Not what I remember...

A fun addition to the LP collection 
Okay 
10 minutes of noise in a box 
Okay set if your children are gentle it may last

This is a Band in a Box SPECIFICALLY if you dont want the band to be loud

Nice

Kids like it mom not so much 
Cute set but wish it had a whistle or harmonica. 
It's a pen? No it's a penpencil. 
A bit too much like a bad pen 
Cool Concept Flawed Implementation 
An Erasable Pen With an Identity Complex 
Neat concept erases well 
Nice Idea but not as great in the hand 
Great for pen people who need a #2 pencil for tests not for sketching or drawing 
Excellent for paragraphs frustrating for short notes 
Erasable for a few hours not three days 
Headed in the right direction ... 
Good once you get the hang of the shrinking.....

Thought it was bigger 
The surprise was the size 
Great toy lasts about a day 
Good but small 
Wish I could give it 4 stars

Cute But Overpriced...... 
Daughter thinks it's a \friendly baby monster\ not a bunny 
overall good 
Music=great Juno's voice=Not 
Well-intentioned but... ack! Those voices! 
Not my kids' favorite music 
Music That's Not Totally Annoying 
The discription is incorrect 
Lukewarm for Tots 
Rhythm is Everywhere 
This isn't a bad DVD at all 
Needs to be Part of a Larger Education 
Didn't do a thing for my daughter 
Go for the real thing. 
Not to Bad for Original Music. 
Fun but not as fun as the DVD 
This is a fine CD not action baby music 
Modern orchestral classical music for kids who are Juno Baby Fans 
If your child is really into Juno then he or she will probably really like it 
Pretty Annoying. 
Music is fine but voices are annoying 
Different product 
This is a cute CD

Good...but skip the cat 
Probably helps to know the characters

Decent 
Not the best but not the worst 
Good Flash Cards 
A Few Good Shots 
Good volume spray but pump-to-squirt means you have no long range accuracy 
Cool idea but inferior to the cheaper Scatter Blast 
Fun but there are better options 
If Looks Could \Kill\ 
It works but it's the worst of the competition 
not nerfs best water gun.... 
Works but you won't win the water war with this one. 
Awesome idea but no real advantage 
Fun 
Nice set of sheets could be packaged better 
Just okay 
Too hard for preschoolers

Just ok 
Like this book but not sure why some of the examples for letters were used 
Big Birds Voice over and over and over 
For costume 
Cool flashlight but nothing more

Cute Doll Daughter Loves It Hair Is Messy! 
Not at all what I expected

Fun but overly silly 
fun here and there but we're unlikely to play it again 
Could have been better!

Confusing . . . Misses the Mark Had Potential

Updated but still a little dated. 
Might be good for a party

I think there are better truly cooperative games out there

I want my evening back! 
More A Learning Activity Than A Game

OKAY TRAIN 
Not a Puzzle - More a Model 
More model than puzzle 
A step by step project challenge is in getting the pieces to stay 
A 3D building set; not a 3D puzzle. 
More of a Model than Puzzle 
Not for me 
Okay but not what we expected... 
Not so much a puzzle as it is a build-by-numbers model 
Not really a puzzle 
3-D puzzle 
The word \puzzle\ is a bit misleading... 
Not quite like other ravensburger puzzles. 
Great Concept For A Puzzle But Flimsy Design 
Good fun product but wished.. 
Really Didn't Enjoy This 
Pleasing Puzzle but Pieces too Interchangeable 
Another quality Ravensburger Puzzle 
For Older Kids 
Gorgeous but difficult 
Cool not as cool as it appears 
while age six and up might be a stretch a teen and adult group not tv addicted might find this diverting 
Nice but too easy 
Good puzzle but 3D effect is minimal 
My 5 year old did it in 15 minutes 
HUGE puzzle and too many pieces can connect even when they don't actually go together 
Be forewarned; finger cramps and strained hearing come with these entertaining little creatures... 
Now I'm thinking about being one for Halloween. 
A bit disappointing... 
Hmmm My Kids Love This  But I'm a Bit Confused 
Press (and press again) the Belly 
Wait for the next generation...

Nice toy 
Educational Picnic Basket Toy

Hmmmm... 
I really wanted my son to like this! 
Needs to be more sensitive 
Too much pop too much bop 
Not worth it 
Fun but fragile and loud 
Day 35 and counting 
Loud Motor and can easily break 
somewhat tacky toy without much educational value 
My kids aren't crazy about it 
It's a hit or miss sort of toy. 
Baby loved it but not working after only three months 
Attention-keeping toy not one to \cuddle\

Easier use than older model still not much you can do with it 
A childhood wish fulfilled 
Nostalgic but not practical 
Ok 
pam 
Has not improved with age! 
Definitely a toy oven 
My daughter loves this price for extras not so much!!! 
For a child this is a great little oven. 
Great minifigs but a so-so speeder 
Not A Set Designed For Play 
Not sure of the appeal 
Good but not Great 
A Hit!

Plain old Play-doh is best! 
Fun but not for the long-term 
Play-doh makes dough off this 
Potty doll 
Fun but short-lived Fun 
Cute but pricey to continually feed 
Decent doll added expense can be offputting 
Technical review only - actually fairly traditional doll 
Fun for a bit but imagination trumps simulation 
Great for the imagination not a \learning\ toy 
Good toy much loved enough room for two to play 
Bought for my daughter 
The wheel just doesn't stay on. Frustrating. 
Engages ANY Child 
Should have been more 
Fun set with lots of play but overpriced 
Not the greatest set by far and beware of false list price 
not big 
Storage & carry along 
Better Than The Trunkie! 
Bag is Flat 
Serve the purpose but smell 
Not the same as the organizer tote for Trunki! 
its ok 
Great for about 5 minutes 
Not suitable for a 2 year old 
Not suitable for grass 
For the price get a bubble mower. 
I just don't know where to fly it.

A bit much for younger kids. 
Like legos; mine was missing a few pieces. 
A good starter project 
This is not a toy for the age group indicated 
Fun but no Transformation!!!! 
cute idea 
Not as good as Wilson and Brewster. 
It's ok 
Okay but a bit boring I'm told 
Disassembly required for 'transformation'. Not compatible with Lego. Would not buy again but it looks nice on the shelf. 
Toy lacking in playability and fostering imagination/creativity. 
Good but not Lego 
My boys are consumed! 
Difficult ... Time Consuming ...

Well made & Safer than hitting one anther with your hands. 
Fun 
Eh 
Not a long lasting toy 
Good for pretend play 
Reasonable for a big Star Wars fan but not a lot else. 
Fun for kid and adult Star Wars fans 
Slimmer than the old model 
Could have been so much better.

single string shooter just ok 
Okay 
My kid's love Beyblade!  This launcher?  Not as much...

Impressive But Difficult to Play With 
Autobots - Transform and Rollout! 
Paratrooper GI Joe 
Cool life-like toy; parachute works alright 
\WOW!!!\ from a 4-year old -- says it all! 
Parachute Problems 
Really not for younger kids at all - unless you like work 
wish it was slightly bigger 
Great thought - but someone didn't think it all the way through. 
An OK case...but rather small 
Not what I expected. 
Ideal for discriminating younger Jedi 
Lightweight pretty but no substance 
Decent Starter Set 
Love Beyblade but the stadium's no fun... 
Works better on floor than in the battle ring 
Good for 7 year old boy but flimsy 
Okay but the stadium feels cheap and isn't much fun 
Children liked it but it gets old fast. 
time will tell 
PRICE GOUGING!!!!

My 4 year old loves it. 
A fun side-arm despite flaws 
The Next Generation 
Good for 10 years and below for 2 days!!

Can You Remember When Fighting Tops Were Made of Wood and Powered by String? 
Okay but gets boring 
Stick with the manual Beyblades 
Ok not the best Nerf gun. Good value for disk shooters. 
Fun but not great 
Problems with the ammo holder 
Most expensive but least fun of the Vortex line 
A lot of fun in short bursts 
Flywheels are not a good automatic substitute. 
It's okay but not much gun for the money 
Ok but some flaws 
A one-trick oven 
Very small for 5 year old better for toddlers 
Fun at First.....A Little too Small 
Cheaply made look elsewhere 
Unimpressed with Quality 
Little mommy 
A very realistic doll 
Overpriced 
gift

Not a Toy To Play With 
Very very pretty but very very limited! 
Annoying to adults but my child loves it. 
You can't change her clothes. :(

Our Dolls Heads Are Falling Off!!! 
This toy has potential but I am unsure about the age range. 
Didn't hold my 6 year old's attention 
Looks great but there's just not much to it. 
Loud and weird blocky pixel color - repeats itself if you don't give it attention 
Another dump truck but now with noise! 
Standard Dump Truck Toy. Pretty Loud. 
Good for 2 yr old. but...

Construction fair 
Daughter loved it I think it's creepy 
Bought for the clothes.

It'll do 
Well Made

The fun doesn't last too long but we use it for other things. 
Cute idea! 
Just meh on this one. 
Fun But Supplies (and I'm Guessing Toy) Won't Last Long

Son loves but it is very frustrating 
Quality Control Issues Not Our Favorite 
Smaller Than Expected

everyone wants firetruck 
Matchbox smokey the Fire Truck 
Disappointed 
He talks dances farts and shoots balls.

Munchkin Deluxe Review by Dad's Gaming addiction 
It is a good game. 
It's alright 
Great Educational Game But Loud Noises Aren't Lucky! 
Cheaply made and eats batteries 
Obviously not as good as Scrabble; not even as good as Scrabble Slam 
Well... 
OK - But Not Perfect 
Some people may enjoy it but it's NOT Scrabble 
Children and teens - Yes ~ Adults - not so much

Barbie Designable Hair Extensions Doll - HAIRTASTIC! 
Creative and fun 
This is the CHEAPEST most FLIMSY Barbie Tent I have ever *played* with.W 
Once it's assembled by an adult it's fun for the kids 
Has a dorm room aesthetic but has much to be desired 
Just OK... 
Kitty 2-way 
Cute 
Surprisingly fun but way too expensive for what it is. 
Incredibly small incredibly expensive 
mixed feelings 
Kids loved it at first. 
Dyson Ball Vacuum 
Too expensive poor craftsmanship 
Good 
If your kids like Apple they won't like this. 
Battery drainer 
Hardly educational with expensive cartridges and pathetic apps 
Only OK 
screen damaged after three days.  Eats up batteries like candy 
After the lines and pushing at the store to get a toy tablet 
Acceptable sleeves and way better than nothing 
Different but not better. 
As discribed 
Not made for a young child 
Okay but doesn't have last appeal 
Great Concept 
Great fun and hours of entertainment! 
Solid and fun if slightly less so than LeapPad 
Toss up between the InnoTab and LeapPad 
Just OK. 
Ready set...start adding! 
It's ok 
Some fun 
I prefer the original especially for 2 players

Farkle Fun 
If you don't have room on your wall for all the tracks skip this one 
Just gave as gift to 5 year old 
Our Product is not Like the Picture 
Great truck- but I got price gouged. 
Save your money just get the regular Uno instead 
Mind-numbing for adults but my little Angry Birds fan loves it 
OK but probably not going to win classic game status 
Good game for boys 
Simple card game. 
Cheaper than the other Cars toys we have 
Lower quality than the other characters in the line. 
ok 
It does what it is supposed to do but lacks in quality 
Not as well made as i thought

draculara doll 
Good starter doll but classroom outfit = Day at the Maul Fashion Set 
not great 
Fun but 
not worth cost 
fun to play with 
Small and cheap 
Fun game but small 
No shame in Original Zero 
be careful when breaking

The Alex kit is better. 
Struggle for Catan 
Decent musical toy kind of annoying though 
This toy is awesome but has durablity issues 
First one was defective... 
too advanced for a 2 1/2 year old 
Cute idea but very messy 
Not an essential item for your budding artist 
It's functional but needs improvements 
It's nice to have a portable art easel but it needs some work 
Lots of stuff but just so-so jewelry 
Great for mobile skills 
Easy to use Photos don't morph well limited choices 
Great for classrooms - who use Crayola crayons 
Unknown yet 
Takes Too Long to Keep Kids Interested 
Fun if You Don't Expect Too Much in Advance 
Not as good as the original but fun 
Crayola has better products & crayons to choose from 
Needs Parents Help 
Eh 
Patience and Cleanup Required 
Pretty neat toy if it works properly. 
Okay but clean up is an issue 
too much work too little result 
Picture overpromises what the item does. 
Not Crayola's best option 
Not for every kid 
Rated \Good\ by kids ages 6 & up. 
Better for younger children perhaps? 
Not great for a four year old 
So-so 
Fun Characters from the movie. 
Wish the wheels really rolled!

Kids like it but educational value is not as good as it should be. 
Nice but 
SKIP THIS 
Expensive apps stylus based short battery life yet entertaining 
Not bad but not worth all the hype... 
Beware if you plan to buy this and don't live in the US

Good and yet annoying. 
It's alright 
Not worth it for my child 
Cute 
Ok but not worth the money 
It's ok But Interest is lost quickly 
Not worth more than 10 bucks Max 
Not the best in the D-Arts Mega Man line 
Didn't hold her interest long 
Barely adequate 
Best for indoor ---- think hall/gymnasium ---- use. 
Kids like them and they're pretty neat to watch but that's all you do
