After a Short Time - Chain is Rusted 
Not 35-40 pounds 
Undecided about this product 
Love - Hate relationship 
Thought I would need a new one 
Mediocre 
Good Idea...If Your Cats Cooperate 
I do not own one of these...but do have 2 cats 
There are better choices

It works but... 
Poorly designed 
it's the only alternative 
So Thin :( 
Needs revamped made cheaper

Addendum to my previous criticism of ACCSusan by William Robbins 
I think I will stick with Frontline next time 
Better half the dose twice a month

Good smell does an adequate job 
Not as useful as I thought. 
Nice toy but

Not so great 
I like the shorter length launcher better. 
Absolute Necessity for Small Ball Lovers! 
Not Sure How to Rate This 
Great product if your dog is not a chewer 
Wrong size 
Does not last longer than standard tennis balls 
Too Big for Small Dogs 
Great when it works! 
Only lasts 2 years but worth it!
