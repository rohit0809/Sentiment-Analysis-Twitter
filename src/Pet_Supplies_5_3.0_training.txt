Nice Distraction for my cats for about 15 minutes 
You really only need vol 2 
Poop!  Ugh! 
Has decreased the frequency but not eliminated it 
Just so-so 
After a Short Time - Chain is Rusted 
Not 35-40 pounds 
Undecided about this product 
Love - Hate relationship 
Thought I would need a new one 
Mediocre 
Good Idea...If Your Cats Cooperate 
I do not own one of these...but do have 2 cats 
There are better choices 
Can't live with it can't live without it 
It works but... 
Poorly designed 
it's the only alternative 
So Thin :( 
Needs revamped made cheaper 
Poop things. 
Necessary for my LittterMaid 
so so 
these work but . . . 
Good idea could be improved try a bag inside from petmate 
I Have Flange Issues 
Just ok... 
Litter Maid Rec. 
Cute ball but not for xxs dogs 
Not Quite as Responsive as I Would Have Hoped 
Just Okay 
Not really useful for what I wanted it for 
Not a favorite 
Funny 
Oh NOooo Mr Bill my dog bit your nose off

Great for a non agressive chewing beast

It's okay 
Just could hang 
Dog loves the toy but it is coming apart already 
Sturdy toy 
Squeaker was killed in less than 10 minutes 
Too small 
It's small 
Cute for short lived 
my dog ate the tail but the rest is going good 
Too small.

Very cute however 
Well-made 
Another small toy 
Is your dog a gentle dog? 
Well made not my pup's favorite though.

Addendum to my previous criticism of ACCSusan by William Robbins 
I think I will stick with Frontline next time 
Better half the dose twice a month 
Ho hum 
NOT AS PICTURED 
This didn't work on my dog. 
flea control 
Good smell does an adequate job 
Not as useful as I thought. 
Nice toy but 
OK but a bit loose on the balls 
works but too pricey. 
It's okay product 
Not so great 
I like the shorter length launcher better. 
Absolute Necessity for Small Ball Lovers! 
Not Sure How to Rate This 
Great product if your dog is not a chewer 
Wrong size 
Does not last longer than standard tennis balls 
Too Big for Small Dogs 
Great when it works! 
Only lasts 2 years but worth it!

Extremely durable 
Gets unsightly fast. 
Not Ideal if You Have Carpet

My Boston terrier doesn't play with it much 
Probably too much for the Shiba 
Hard plastic chew toy 
Wish they made this in dura chew durability

OK 
Not quite a home run because the tail end is sharp and jagged. It's also smaller the I thought it would be. 
Small dog ignores it 
For aggressive chewers

Only for smaller dogs
