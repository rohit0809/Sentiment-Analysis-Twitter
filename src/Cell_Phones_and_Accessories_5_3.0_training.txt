Like the basic product.

Handy but .... 
imitation 
its ok 
Works good 
Small and good power output; some fit problems 
Know the limitations 
It does work somewhat. 
Delicate and consumes too much space 
Significant change makes this cradle not as good as it used to be

Blackberry 8520 
it's ok 
DISAPPOINTED 
Wasn't for me 
A cell phone as anyone else. 
Not a smartphone pretty good if it were the year 2006 
Bought as a back up phone for my son. 
Bluetooth connectivity work well just needs some refinement for the sound quality. 
Tenqa. Tenga?  Tonka?  What?!? 
2.5 Stars - Simple Bluetooth Speaker With Average Sound Quality

Convenient but mediocre sound 
Decent speakers light but need to keep bluetooth close 
Great sound & loud for music but not quite on par for calls 
eh it's alright 
Brilliant Color but Only Protects Against Scratches 
Well the color is ok but it's clear and darker and not as shiny and pretty. Also this is one of those cheap covers ... 
Limited Output Power -- Beware Newer Phones 
The little charger that could (get stuck) 
Still in Box 
Three Stars

OK but spacing isn't as good as others 
Very thin fits a passport overpriced. 
Too dificult to apply. 
Case coul not fit the phone 
it's ok 
The best bluetooth that I've found so far but not perfect 
OK device *if* it was delivered w/ear buds - seller did not/will not provide 
Ok product but expensive (if purchasing it) and do you really need it? 
interesting concept poor execution 
It's *beeping* charging! Hope you have a *beeping* Iphone otherwise you're out of *beeping* luck. 
Needs more compatibility expensive with additional purchases. 
An \A\ for design but not sure if it's worth it for the $ 
Inventive but Impractical 
Very useful charging station with one catch... 
Almost a great product 
Charges perfectly but some design flaws hindered my love 
It charges 
Convenient tool...with an ugly design 
This Novelty Charger has a LONG way to go to be Useful! 
Good concept 
Another unfinished product hit the market. 
Okay for multiple phones not so much for one 
The Novelty Wears Off Quickly 
Great idea for a household with multiple cell phones BUT it can only be used for specific phones 
Nice with some major limitations. Very good for desk use. 
The \Power Sleeve\ doesn't add up to convenience or savings 
Not what I expected 
Similar to the Powermat Cheaper But With Similar Drawbacks 
Works Fine but has a couple limitations. 
Works OK But A Little Bit Inconvenient 
Charging Made Simple - But With A Tradeoff And Expensive 
A GOOD CHOICE FOR CHARGING MATS 
Duracells' Charge 
Great idea poor execution 
This is the future 1st version.  Perfect for a gadget person. 
Easy To Use But Likely Not Useful For Everyone

It's a battery 
Pantech USB Data Cable 
Works....most of the time 
Pretty at first but did hold up for long.

Necessary Evil 
Works well (enough) for iphone 4 
Good but scratches 
It's only front protectors! 
Practical BUT... 
Basic Case. Decent Price. But I'm Just Not a Fan of Silicone Cases. 
Better than My Other Silicone Generic. Still Prefer to Use a Bumper Case. 
Fits 4S but really loose 
Inferior to other AmazonBasics case 
A little loose 
I won't purchase again! 
Only O.K. 
it's OK not bad not good... OK 
Nice and soft....but a bit loose fitting 
pretty good...but basic

Cheap Apple charger knock-off 
charger rate 
It's ok for what I needed it for. 
Awesome A2DP good volume & fit; one FATAL flaw 
I didn't care for it -- the controls are too small to comfortably use 
Its strength is also its weakness 
Decent sound but the charger and manual are big failures 
A good value overall with mixed call quality and tiny buttons

Seriously doubt this is an OEM pod. 
Kinda bulky you're better off with a standard USB charger and an OEM cable 
Be careful it is what you were looking for. 
Works for a little while 
Works..so far 
Only 1 set of gel covers 
Good ones.. sound quality is good 
Great while it lasted

DOES NOT CHARGE HP TOUCHPAD 
Like the basic product. 
Failed after 9 months 
Handy but .... 
imitation 
its ok 
Works good 
Small and good power output; some fit problems 
Know the limitations 
It does work somewhat. 
Delicate and consumes too much space 
Significant change makes this cradle not as good as it used to be

Blackberry 8520 
it's ok 
DISAPPOINTED 
Wasn't for me 
A cell phone as anyone else. 
Not a smartphone pretty good if it were the year 2006 
Bought as a back up phone for my son. 
Bluetooth connectivity work well just needs some refinement for the sound quality. 
Tenqa. Tenga?  Tonka?  What?!? 
2.5 Stars - Simple Bluetooth Speaker With Average Sound Quality 
Gets the job done 
Convenient but mediocre sound 
Decent speakers light but need to keep bluetooth close 
Great sound & loud for music but not quite on par for calls 
eh it's alright 
Brilliant Color but Only Protects Against Scratches 
Well the color is ok but it's clear and darker and not as shiny and pretty. Also this is one of those cheap covers ... 
Limited Output Power -- Beware Newer Phones 
The little charger that could (get stuck) 
Still in Box 
Three Stars 
Meh 
OK but spacing isn't as good as others 
Very thin fits a passport overpriced. 
Too dificult to apply. 
Case coul not fit the phone 
it's ok 
The best bluetooth that I've found so far but not perfect 
OK device *if* it was delivered w/ear buds - seller did not/will not provide 
Ok product but expensive (if purchasing it) and do you really need it? 
interesting concept poor execution 
It's *beeping* charging! Hope you have a *beeping* Iphone otherwise you're out of *beeping* luck. 
Needs more compatibility expensive with additional purchases. 
An \A\ for design but not sure if it's worth it for the $ 
Inventive but Impractical 
Very useful charging station with one catch... 
Almost a great product 
Charges perfectly but some design flaws hindered my love 
It charges 
Convenient tool...with an ugly design 
This Novelty Charger has a LONG way to go to be Useful! 
Good concept 
Another unfinished product hit the market. 
Okay for multiple phones not so much for one 
The Novelty Wears Off Quickly 
Great idea for a household with multiple cell phones BUT it can only be used for specific phones 
Nice with some major limitations. Very good for desk use. 
The \Power Sleeve\ doesn't add up to convenience or savings 
Not what I expected 
Similar to the Powermat Cheaper But With Similar Drawbacks 
Works Fine but has a couple limitations. 
Works OK But A Little Bit Inconvenient 
Charging Made Simple - But With A Tradeoff And Expensive 
A GOOD CHOICE FOR CHARGING MATS 
Duracells' Charge 
Great idea poor execution 
This is the future 1st version.  Perfect for a gadget person. 
Easy To Use But Likely Not Useful For Everyone 
the idea is good...but 
replacement cell phone battery

It's a battery 
Pantech USB Data Cable 
Works....most of the time 
Pretty at first but did hold up for long.

Works well but structural flaw 
Wrong case 
BB case 
It's a good phone but did not make me \very\ happy 
Great For Nerds -- Too Little Too Late To Be A Mass-Market Competitor

Samsung Headset Review 
Works well while it lasts 
If you didn't get the expected \free headset\ with your recent smart phone purchase these will replace that missing option.
