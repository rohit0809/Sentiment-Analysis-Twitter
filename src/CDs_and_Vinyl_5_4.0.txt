Classic - But where are the missing tracks? 
Pink Floyd the Wall CD re-mastered box set 
Pink Floyd's last great album 
best album worst idea? 
Best rock concept album 
A tad overrated a tad overplayed but by no means a poor effort 
Not the best not the worst 
Masterpiece 
Landmark album... 
A trip 
The rock opera of Pink aka a mutation of Syd and Roger 
Great Concept Album One of the Best of All Time But So-so Sound Quality! 
Not as great as everyone would like you to think 
Not Floyd's best but still great. 
Well cemented bricks 
Any band but Pink Floyd would get 5 stars! 
Roger Water's Wall 
Sounds like a remake of.... 
Good album but not Pink Floyd at their best 
pink floyd with roger waters time ten 
This Wall is not gonna be fall! 
Get the live version (Is There Anybody Out There) instead. 
Great but The Final Cut and Dark Side are better 
Wonderful pressing 
A long narritive set to rock; not entirely successful. 
Brilliant but hard to get through in one setting 
The Wall CD 
A Classic.....But NOT The Greatest. 
PINK FLOYD'S WALLS &amp; BRIDGES 
Great songs but.... 
Almost Masterpiece 
One hugely angry massively powerful rock album 
more ambitious than dark side not as perfect but still great 
Hey You! 
PRETTY GOOD 
&quot;If you want to find out whats behind these cold eyes&quot; 
Nice collection 
This is NOT like Modest Mouse 
Rather Listen To Dark Side of the Moon 
The Wall 
Great! But... 
Genius that is weighed down by pretentiousness 
More relevent than before... 
All in all... 
it has great moments 
Great album but I don't feel that it is the best.

My Second Favorite Cream Album Next To \Disreali Gears\!! 
Amazing Album...Harsh Remaster

Brilliant Playing So So Recording 
Hits and Misses 
Those Were The Days (Yes They Were) 
Clapton is G(o)od 
I bought this only for one song: Pressed Rat and Warthog. 
as you said 
Exceptional album from Cream receives outstanding digital transfer (and some editions have three hidden tracks) 
Still \Fresh\ even after all of these years 
Terrible Bonus Songs - Get the Original Release Version Instead

Wilson's great album 
Best of All-time??? NO WAY JOSE

Pet Sounds.  The best ever?  No... 
Why &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; isn't the greatest album of all time 
A Top 100 Album 
Overrated but still essential 
good for its time.

A very organic album 
Very good not the best in my mind. 
Great Album - Not great re-release 
A hard rocking album with some acoustic pieces 
less one star for slightly dull \re-issue\ sound but 5 stars for music 
A definite classic but it's still not quite the best Tull cd (upgraded from 3 to 4 stars) 
Heavy Tull! 
GREAT LISTEN 
Amazing album but avoid the early US releases! 
Timeless classic

Such an experimental jazz stuff ... another memorable l.p. 
A great place to hide from reality 
A sampler for a set that never happened.
