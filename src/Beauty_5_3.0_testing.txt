Don't get all the fuss 
Good for moisturizing; does not illuminate sheer coverage

Unimpressive as foundation substitute. Holds promise as foundation primer. 
Odd product 
Seems to Work but Don't Expect Miracles.

Mixed feelings on this one

Better than any Sally Product 
Ok I guess 
what can I say 
Teeny tiny. 
Almost satisfied 
not like my old ones but still ok 
Would rather have all larger rollers that are streamed. 
Old-fashioned electric rollers 
Used to be the best but the formula has changed in the past year 
Not bad but somewhat disappointing overall 
Never wants to come off! 
The brush is too big 
Why does everyone like this product? 
Lovely mascara not so lovely brush 
More cons than pros equals barely average product. 
Hmmmmmm...its definitely not for straightening your hair from poofy to silk straight

Typical loofah but the cord is a bit annoying 
Exfoliates well but more suitable for the body 
Haven't used Yet

Greasy.  Not conditioning.  Pass. 
A good blowout spray

Okay 
mmm I wouldn't call it a miracle... but it's ok

Soothes painful ears -- but not for sensitive noses! 
Good color lousy consistency. 
Odd color but I like it. 
Just OK 
Not as great as I expected.. 
Not sure now 
Couldn't tell if it worked 
Too many chemicals! !!! 
Works well not fond of scent

It's too brassy 
LIGHT brown? Maybe later but not at first! 
Not any better than a regular dryer 
Nice concept but still needs work.

Limited use hairdryer for long hair only 
Great Comfortable Dryer But Not a Fan of the Attachments 
Average Hairdryer - accessories unnecessary 
Great Dryer...Lose the Cartridge 
Heavy duty blow dryer but that's it. 
A Dryer and Hair Conditioner Into One 
Not really for short or simple hair 
LIght weight... 
Great dryer don't care for the conditioner 
Say No... To Wax Build-up

It's fine for the price 
Not impressed with this straightener.

short term benefit 
Unpleasant smell 
Okay 
What happened to this product? 
Lotion fragrance and not that that great 
Not as emollient as expected 
Of the 3 Total Moisture scents this one is my least favorite 
Mild light and inexpensive lotion.  Good for general light use for slightly dry skin. 
Underwhelmed 
Dove Cream Oil Alright for the Price 
Hmm.. 
Wrong Combination 
Less scented but not unscented 
Contains FRAGRANCE 
Product is okay but packing leaves much to be desired 
More lotion-like than body wash 
Very Little Lather.. 
Nice product but scent could use some work. 
There Is No \Burst\ 
Will stick with Deep Dove Moisture 
Decent moisturizer but it smells like a 1970s aftershave

not bad 
meh... 
Creases!! 
Don't buy from Kiosks

Not as good for long hair 
Impossible not to burn yourself 
BUT 
Good tool a little hard to use 
Not good for fine thin hair and clumsy people

Not so Great Liner 
I wish I could give 10 stars after using it 1st but it does not do anything to my face after using for a while. 
Might work for you didn't for me 
Harsh 
Good for puffy eyes!!! 
My purchase. 
Nice colors 
Slow but Eventual Progress 
This is ok 
Unsure how to combine with a commonly prescribed Rx topical 
Don't expect dramatic results 
Works ok but smells like furniture polish. 
eh 
Still can't figure this one out 
Not sooo gut but useful 
it's alright 
Good as a sunscreen not so much as powder foundation 
Smells terrible!

Does what it promises but not for the price 
Takes Time 
Not to Sure About These 
Comparable to Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner 
Not as I imagined 
Worked ok 
Not sure 
Like a literal marker 
It's an okay eyeliner for begginers. 
never again...

It seamed expensive 
This is so embarrassing 
Was Good While It Lasted.... 
So many duplicates! 
Just okay for a travel set 
its ok but not for someone practicing with make up

Just Average 
Not Really For Me 
OK shampoo but friz control isn't great 
Not impressed...it's like a 'normal' shampoo. 
Not the best 
Can feel a difference in the DRY summer air 
There are better Pantene's out there 
Thick means your hair cuticle course hair not if you have typical thick hair like a lot of hair cuticles! 
Just an average conditioner 
OK BUT NO DIFFERENT THAN USING REGULAR PANTENE PRODUCTS 
dissappointed. 
eh 
wish it was brighter... 
Illumination is heat generation 
It's okay but the light is too bright 
hard to use doesn't foam much 
Off-color

It did its part 
Almost perfect 
My 8x counter-top is about the same 
Sticky Shampoo 
Black Castor oil shampoo 
Redkin is the best... not sure about color extend... 
It works just a bit pricey 
More like a body spray.... 
Have used it 3 times

Insanely Black tanning lotion 
New to tingle 
Love it except for one ingredient. 
Ok 
Bought for a friend... 
GEL FLEX TOE STRETCHERS 
I like the older Noxzema better this one causes slight burning sensation in sensitive areas 
Nice smell but way too overpriced for doing practically nothing. 
Good product a bit too pricey for the size 
Thin texture 
Not much results but no alleric reaction. 
Dull 
Too light 
Very sheer 
Looks nothing like the picture 
Its ok 
This set is ok

it works but I think I can do better 
Good soap great scent 
Very tiny 
Smells great runs not very long lasting 
Wanted to like it... 
Pretty but.... 
natural but not a lot of staying power 
Okay Bath Brush 
It's okay 
A Note On Color 
Great color...however very messy! 
Quite nice 
I didn't notice any improvement 
It does what is does 
An OK mask and scrub 
it's decent 
Good mask for acne prone oily skin 
Pretty good; not blown away 
ok but nothing special for the price 
work decent but why the parabens? 
Good moisturizer but makes skin shiny. 
Sex In The City 
It's ok 
Ehhh 
Great price 
Smells Great...Controls Shine 
Not what i had hoped 
I thought this was awesome but.... 
Not accurate grits 
Matte not moisturizing but good coverage 
It works like a charm at first. 
So-so but... 
On the fence 
love the color. 
Barbie would be happy 
eh.. 
Helps but not dramatic 
Hard to hold and get leverage 
No complaints this is a pretty generic product 
I bought the day and night brightening lotions and 
The colors all get mixed 
very very small 
This product is very small good for nail art 
Tiny super tiny but not bad at all... 
It's Okay For The Price 
Not what I pictured... 
Gets the job done 
Not 1200!!! 
The product does not stay in your hair until washed ... 
Gloppy. 
It will do 
Color is more purple an I thought 
Light light grey 
literally \clearly\ pink 
On the fence 
Very sheer 
The color is not what I expected 
Not my favorite color 
Sheer 
Ok but..... 
Hard to apply 
Love Shellac 
Iced colors a little more \troublesome\ 
It's not you it's me... or my skin tone... or something... 
Good polish 
It's ok 
Not enough product for the money. 
thanks! :) 
Not for tightlining/waterlining 
boring black-blue 
Meh. 
Good at first but... 
Worthwhile if you do NOT have sensitive skin 
Not yet sure if this is going to work for me 
It May Work.... 
Pretty Happy with Eyelash Grow 
Couldn't continue use due to itchy lids 
Couldn't tell a difference 
Just okay. 
Iritating to the eyes for what little difference it makes 
Not A Product For Me 
What price beauty? 
Very slight difference 
Good luck if you have the patience 
The \caution\ statement startled me 
Not a big difference 
I wish I could say more... 
OK.. 
Too Soon To Say 
I was allergic but like the idea of a non-Rx lash grower 
After 6 weeks a bit more growth 
More a conditioning product than a growth product 
Must take time . . . 
Envyderm Eyelash Enhancement 
Ok for a Non-Rx 
Not sure if it works or not 
Is it worth the price? 
Not bad but nothing great 
Irritates sensitive areas 
Just ok 
Not the worst but would not buy again 
Where's the Carrot? 
Yes To Tomatoes Conditioner 
Compliments the Shampoo Nicely 
Too heavy for my skin and seems to take forever to be absorbed 
Not for me 
Not for my skin type 
MIght break you out still trying to decide 
Yeasy to put on the eye 
Just Okay 
Not my favorite 
Yes to Tomatoes 
Smooth texture seems to work well enough for some things 
Yes to Tomatoes 
Just meh 
damaged but good product 
no mirror 
Extensive Colors No Staying Power 
good 
3D 
Really pasty 
Halfway Pure 
I expected more 
HAVE USE IT AND HAVEN'T SEEN ANY NOTICEABLE IMPROVEMENTS 
Ewwwww the tangles and matting!!! 
its ok 
useless 
Good enough for lghter skin ..\ok \ for black girls 
For a little thing... 
Not alot of power but PERFECT travel size 
Works great and thankfully they changed design a little 
It's ok not great 
Kind of disappointing to be honest 
Lightweight moisturizer but not for all skin types 
I liked the product but not the smell 
Light weight & Sunscreen Coverage = Modrate Moisturizing 
Average quality moisturizer 
a bit too thick for my taste 
GOES ON SMOOTHLY 
Okay for sunscreen. Not my favorite moisturizer. 
Not what I expected but still good 
OK but not better than my usual 
Good moisturizer
