I can't keep it on all night. 
Okay product 
How can u sleep with this thing 
Buy the cheaper version in the black and white box... 
Good at first but... 
Am I supposed to feel something? 
Price Has Increased Sharply in the Last Two Years (up 93%)! 
Nasty-Tasting and Hard-To-Swallow. 
Product Packageing the Rollerball Doesn't work 
You either love it or hate it 
Cool when it works - Stressful when it doesn't 
Great Idea terrible quality

Keeps things fresher longer 
Too expensive 
*sigh* not great for thick hair 
decided I dont like it. Initially it irritated me so bad I ...

Foiled by the foil 
The Over-rated Shaver 
For sensitive skin never again! 
A dull razor right out of the box. 
Even at $54 it's not a good purchase 
Uninspiring Razor 
mediocre shave 
Not good 
Not good if you have much facial hair. 
Looks nice but does not shave well.  There are better options below this price point.... 
Why? 
OK for very short beards but very time consuming... 
Women are Hairy Beasties Too 
Not as good as past Norelco products 
Strange engineering! 
I wanted to like it 
It is what it is and it does what it should but not the BEST! 
Typical Electric Shaver 
Not really a lubricant...a spray cleaner yes! 
Redmond Clay 
Doesn't mix well and at 5 scoops is a horrible value 
not sure if it works 
Follow-up Review After Almost Two Years of Use 
WAY TOO LOUD 
I really wanted to like the Arc 4 electric shaver 
I'd prefer a more reliable less-close shave. 
Smells great but I'M PEELING! 
Wish it work but it doesn't 
Does not silent body odor! 
didn't work for me either...... 
Didn't like it there are better products out there 
It was ok! 
I don't buy the reviews 
A Bit Disappointed at first later pleased then unhappy 
NOT for stubble 
Causes razor burn 
Don't waste your money 
Panasonic NO match for Norelco or rotary heads. 
Great... while it lasted 
So Far So Reasonable 
Medicinal with some sting 
I loved it but it's Falling Apart After Two Weeks of Use! 
idk 
Not large enough! 
Poor quality and poor design 
Strange scent and not effective for me personally

Tried 2 times so far 
Cocktail of All Over-the-Counter Sleep Remedies May Not Work Everyday 
Not for me 
They sell these at Dollar Stores what does that tell you?

ok I guess 
Berry tastes like swamp water 
Does not compare to 5 hour energy 
Tastes good not sure about the effect 
You get what you paid for

DONT BUY

These protect blisters but fall off easily 
Pad Sticks to the Blister 
Good but don't get them wet..... 
You'd think wider edge-to-edge means better but it only lets in dirt! 
They stick but leave adhesive on your skin. 
Get Tom's instead. 
Not as good as leading companies 
Too thick and falls apart easily 
NOT SURE IF NEEDED 
To smooth 
Nothing new or extraordinary. 
I can't deal with the many times my skin keeps getting stuck in it!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Thick hair forget this product 
You get what you pay for... 
A Review of the Degree Clinical Protection 
scent stings the nose 
Incredibly Strong Smell 
not all that it promises to be at least for a man 
The smell turns and then wafts up at you. 
Didn't Like This One 
Those who seek natural products will want to avoid Degree Clinical Protection - contains Aluminum based products 
of all the clinical protections this is my least favorite 
Caution: leaves residue behind on dark clothing 
not that great 
Smell too intense.  Clinical is not much stronger than regular.  Directions say apply at night. 
Clinical protection VS regular 
Apply at *NIGHT*?!?!?!?!? 
Not good for sensitive skin***** 
I expected better from Dove 
I wanted to love this.

Prowash - don't like it 
Easy to Use Package But Unpleasant Scent 
It works but it is expensive and vinegar works just as well when added to rinse cycle

Unpleasant with little results 
Yeah they whiten. 
Yes I noticed improved whiteness...but there has to be an easier way. 
Sticky and ineffective
