Good looking pencil too small though. 
Cap and pencil body color don't match 
feels like fake ones

Not a big fan 
Do It Yourself Hanging Folders? 
Good product 
OK at first but lots of issues!

Stick with the ordinary staple remover or your fingernails 
Very well-made but a bit clumsy 
I find it difficult to use 
This One Doesn't Cut It! 
These are definitely \stick needle fine point\. 
Great idea but one fatal flaw. 
Traditional dispensers are better and cheaper

Good envelopes but not as advertised. 
This is Not a Security Envelope. 
Just another ordinary envelope with \features\ 
Not the best I've used... 
FAIL! 
You don't have to lick them but... 
Why? 
Just okay--I would not buy them again. 
Neat concept for envelopes but more glue and darker ink are needed

Very Unstable Drivers on Vista 
Not as good as this one!

Overpriced. 
HP black ink teeny supply 
Stiff and hard to work with 
i find the shape odd 
Difficult to access quickly

Disappointing 
Don't recommend 
Just Another Poor Multi-Line Cordless Option 
Caps get lost easily 
Most definitely not \strong bold color\ 
Won't replace my 5.8 Motorola! 
Don't buy it for the speakerphone 
Decent features for the price - not sure about the quality though... 
Maybe handy in a pinch but no substitute for learning the language 
Not Ready For Prime Time 
Inexpensive But Cumbersome Interface 
Updated review and one less star 
Seems slow to get \to the point\ 
Though its seat cushion is very comfortable it still lacks adjustability options 
Very good quality but made for taller people 
Not worth it 
Not allot of ink 
Didnt stick for me.... 
Good idea but they don't stick that well. 
Works fine but with annoying shortcomings 
Might as well use plain paper 
Solid product but not so \Reduced Effort\ 
Jammed each time every time 
Pretty mediocre printer 
Paper feed issues and HP's ink conspiracy 
Disappointed

A little misleading... 
It is actually USD 5 of postage - the USD 45 is only on subscription 
Sturdy unit---see update please 
labels stick in printer

As bad as it gets 
Might actually try the satisfaction guarantee for these \Permanent\ labels

Dotted Line is not aligned with perforated tear off point 
Did not stay put for long

Avery PocketTabs - OK For Storing Papers and Cards Insufficient For CDs and DVDs 
shame on them for releasing it like this 
Would not purchase 
This isn't my favorite 
Plastic post it 
What's the point? 
A product looking for a good application 
These NoteTabs seem to have a limited purpose 
Mystery tabs! 
\Just one word:\ 
I get it but don't know who would use it 
Limited usability 
No Thanks 
Concept not well executed 
Mac Support? (Not Office) 
Not worth the cost especially for occasional use 
Wasteful 
I like my bigger PaperPro Stapler better 
Cheap and complicated to use 
Construction a bit \Cheap\ 
Works For Awhile 
Not the worst printer I've ever used but it is close 
Strictly average 
Anybody remember the 1958 movie \The Fly\?

A solid design...if it wasn't an inkjet 
Unsatisfactory 
Certain features missing 
Misleading and confusing price structure 
Static and other noises in the line! 
Very very thin 
Right size too flimsy 
Streaky printing 
Don't last dry up quickly bleed through and smears 
Ink are not well marked 
Remarkable color all-in-one for its price point (updated) 
A Total Waste of Money! 
Why re-invent the notebook?? 
Not as nice as the picture indicates 
Good idea but lacks a lot of thought 
Adult trapper keeper? 
Narrow Use. Not Impressed. Cannot Combine with a Paper Planner System. Large Bulky \Organizer\ Doesn't Hold Much. 
Too Rigid and Bulky 
There are better options available 
Well it's big. Useful? Not so much. 
disappointing 
Works OK for my PC Recovery Kit 
An expensive attempt to reinvent the notebook 
Decent for a small project or for a very specific purpose 
Nice theory- but fails in execution 
Good size and storage but insufficient cushioning 
Used with an HP Envy 17 
Not very good flow 
Decent introduction to numbers and math 
The actual stories are not helpful.

Excellent for Taking Closet Space 
An Interesting Idea Hampered By An Uncertain Execution--A Footrest I Frequently Kick Out Of My Way! 
Broke after a few uses! 
It's a footrest with a fan? 
Not all that useful 
Not necessary 
Sorry Kodak but your printer firmware and wireless are problematic 
eliminates a problem that does not exist 
Basically functional but quality isn't great -- noisy 
Gimicky 
Great idea falls short on some finer points 
I Appreciate The Effort but Not the Results 
Sorta comfortable but slowly slides on my chair mat 
I thought I'd like this but it's not for me 
Hard to assemble not high enough 
pointless? 
Disappointing colors 
Need to SCRUB to get it off the white board 
Not very good 
Just Ok 
Not impressed at all 
Doesn't sharpen evenly. 
so-so because the well for shavings is too small 
This pencil sharpener is great 
Doesn't perform as well as marketing would lead you to believe 
In my opinion: Meh. 
Not worth the price. 
O.K. but not for classroom use 
Relatively okay 
Saves space but don't like how it sharpens!! 
Not very good. 
Didn't work for my purpose 
Dissappointing

Not that great even for the price 
Couldn't get it working 
Useful in some ways... not so much in others 
Way smaller than they look 
I wouldn't buy this not likely to last long 
Kind of crappy actually 
I can't imagine what you would use this for. 
It's Cute and it Works But Not Worth $16 
Not as cute in person! 
Fun design but not sturdy 
Great if you enjoy filling landfills. 
Fun but not Functional 
takes up too much room 
Just ok 
Why? 
A product we do not need. 
What was wrong with regular scotch tape rolls? 
This product made me angry 
Good concept but does not work! 
A Product That Serves No Purpose 
strips come out bent 
Not so useful to me but it works 
Overrated. 
Not that useful 
pop up tape 
Annoying to use 
Nice idea execution could be better 
Poor predictability severely limits usability; Seems widely OK for very short usage 
Not As advertised 
If Something Sounds Too Good To Be True.... 
Lets go when you aren't looking 
Does not hold well and takes off paint 
first use and it didn't work 
Not exactly what I hoped for 
Total Crap 
Early model that needs more tweaking! 
Just another thing to need to buy refills for... 
Great for Cards and Scrapbooking! 
I'm mixed about this product... not good for children! 
loser 
be careful where you use it! 
Not Really Reusable 
Funky double-sided tape 
bummed 
High hopes but disappointing 
Generally disappointed.  Tears paper only VERY light material stays put. 
I really wanted to like this... 
My small clock fell off the wall 
Holds but doesn't release well 
Dries out and loses stickiness. 
Scotch Reusable Strips 
Hardly a great item for teachers 
Only OK 
Edited review 
Relatively thick note tab but poor adhesive 
Coverall 
No personal outgoing messages allowed 
Not Impressed 
Get a real dictionary! 
Limited appeal 
Not worth the price 
Mediocore at best.... 
I Finally Gave up on This Thing! 
Too many slots too close together 
Low Quality Sound And Short Distance 
BlueTooth Barely Works 
Gimmicks? Check. Quality? Not so much... 
Great Concept...Poor Execution 
AMAZING product -- but only on paper :( 
Nice features but difficult to operate 
Good but possibly *too* disposable. 
Dry erase markers write well but stain the white board 
dull color and the orange doesn't erase 
Laptop Post-It Dispenser? Really? 
Disappointed; Looks Like a Product in Search of a Market 
Idea is ok but holder is flimsy 
Not Worthy 
Another 3M \Why\ product. 
I think I could live without them and still have a rich rewarding life 
Interesting idea but no. Not for me. 
If it ain't broke... 
no positive point 
Slightly Cumbersome 
A Pretty Basic Holder for Fanned Post-its 
Cute idea in theory but impractical... 
Poor Design but Great for Reaching the $25 Free Shipping Limit! 
Destined for Big Lots stores 
Only Partial Design Success 
Not really necessary 
Not useful for heavy users of post-its 
more of a pain than a help 
Interesting concept but clumsy and disappointing 
Surprisingly less than what you'd expect for what it costs.... 
Good ideas in need of refinement... 
A great idea but the reality was not so great. 
I am so disappointed 
Disappointing experience 
Don't believe the picture 
Not Up To Kensington Standards 
TErrible Dry Erase Board. 
Wish they were better 
Did not handle stains 
Divy It Up 
does not work as intended 
It's not good enough for me. 
A great way to get you to buy ink cartridges 
One stays the other falls.  Low price = weak magnet 
Not too good 
Using to scan textbooks for school - Update: has issues! 
It only takes one bad cartridge... 
Good price but tears easily. 
More \hand friendly\ but not the best tape. 
The Vanishing Ink Trick 
Doesn't lock in place 
Very flimsy 
Flimsy and no perforations

Flimsy cover 
Better products out there...

Eh. 
Great product when it writes 
Not as good as a pen not as good as a pencil... 
Skips a lot 
Too much of a biggest loser add and little use otherwise 
Truthfully I'm Underwhelmed. 
It's a dry erase board with some lines drawn on it 
Kind Of Pointless 
For Die-Hard Fans of the Show Only 
Died right after 1yr warranty expired 
Do not purchase 
WORKED FOR 92 DAYS 
Dispensing is difficult 
decent product ruined by idiotic \feature\ 
Better than Mag-box but not by much. 
Plain paper and web printing needs improvement 
What a headache! 
NOT COOLING! 
A great mat but it shifts 
not great 
Not happy with this mat

A Little Tricky....But Not Too Bad! 
Chair of mediocrity

product is good but the OEM toner ran out way too fast 
Prints great but slow noisy and expensive 
Does not play nicely with OSX 10.8.5.  Turned into a brick after seven months 
Died with a fuser error after one year 
Good if you want to depend on Google Voice being around forever 
The first 10 months it worked fine - UPDATED 
Disappointed. 
Binder with a Nice Grip 
Really not worth the trouble 
Nice unit but a defective cartridge ruined the experience 
Computer interface has few options and labels are low quality 
I must've received a defective unit 
Great Portable Size But Not User Friendly 
A product that I can't recommend. 
I had high hopes but this misses the mark 
frustrating 
sticks out way too far 
Can't get it to work 
Not the best deal for Brother monochrome printer 
Not so easy to use 
Great idea but not fully realized 
Not Impressed. Jams

It is kind of wobbly 
Glorified crayon 
The tip is like a crayon so the gel tip tears! 
$12.99 for 3 too-thin patterned mailers and 3 plain ones is WAY TOO MUCH. 
Hardly replaces gift wrapping! 
Redundant 
Very short life even with minimal use 
Smooth delivery of ink but still globs. 
Comfortable but splotchy 
Can't recommend due to a few issues. 
Smooth but blotchy pens 
Disappointment 
Blotchy and leaves streaks 
Not Good Enough

You are right! These are For Her.. 
Gimmicky 
Easy to write with but won't last long 
Not all I had hoped 
Doesn't fit the hand of this average woman 
Ehhh Not Impressed With these 
and the point was...? 
Started as a 2.5 Ease of Use Made it 4 Stars Durability Sent it Back to 2 
Feels and acts cheap 
I like the stapling mechanism but the feeder is not reliable and there's no way to open this up at the hinge 
Broke in five minutes 
Spring broke after second use 
Nice upgrade.......... please see update!!!

Same old pen. 
Portable and Poorly Conceived Scanner 
You can't pick your frame color; looks cheap 
Cheesy cheap 
Not Well Made 
Flimsy - Looks like it's for Kids 
Inadequate magnets 
Need much stronger mounting magnets to make this work on your fridge. 
Magnets are useless

A bit flimsy 
Too expensive!

Just buy more tape. 
Worked well at first... 
Not what I hoped for cover jiggles all scratched up 
It won't stay together

Cordless phones - what else can I say.

Not for Business Shipments 
Not Thrilled 
Wobbly placement of laptop tricky fake ventilation

Not much better than scissors 
these are huge! 
I have to agree with several other reviewers on this one! 
Takes up two sheets of paper 
Unimpressed--not professional quality. 
Cool but  limited usefulness 
Major Setup Problems and No Paper Drawer 
There are better options than the MX 432 
Canon Pixma MX432 is not 1200x2400 dpi scanner 
Long term peformance issues;  scan has limited options and forced a USB connection... 
I'm staying away from this brand. 
Disappointing beyond the photo printing capabilities 
Nice Try but too much noise 
Laggy Poor cell connectivity 
Not too impressed 
A competent printer with horrible support 
Just Okay 
Bulky/clunky - wait for the next version (if there is one)

Bizarre settings... 
Does what it promises..or so I thought. 
Pencil is Good Erasers are Useless 
Returned it 
not the calculator for me! 
Assembly Required is An Understatement 
Kind of disappointed 
Overpriced annoying chore 
Not what I was hoping for... 
Not much ink. Good quality 
NOT EPSON ORIGINAL CARTRIDGES!!!! 
Ink is fine packaging terrible 
Why advertise that you can print postage from this wireless printer when it has to be hooked up via USB to do so? 
After three months it stopped printing correctly 
Almost Worthless 
Just cardboard really? 
Not Sturdy Enough To Be Useful 
Flimsy and unattractive... I threw mine away. 
Glad I Didn't Have To Pay For This 
Plain cardboard box that's way overpriced. 
Cheap cardboard file box 
It's a box 
A Basic Box (if it worked) 
I am disappointed with this 
A $10.00 cardboard box? 
Buy it and I think you'll be disappointed! 
Flimsy. 
Box seems sturdy at first but collapses when full of paper - definitely not worth the price--it's a cardboard box... 
Pointless by itself and not really much more than a cardboard box 
Cannot recommend.. 
I was expecting something more 
Overpriced 
must be a government job 
Useless! 
Redwelds are better than this 
Overpriced flimsy doesn't do what it claims 
Not worth paying that much for 
Not a strong product 
Good Idea with Big Problems 
The box it came in was sturdier . . . 
Colored cardboard file box that is nothing to write home about 
Folders- functional but not very sturdy. 
Expensive 'starter kit'... 
Organize your price comparisons before purchase 
Nine file folders 
If You Enjoy Getting Ripped Off Try These 
WHY? 
Too Expensive 
Basic filing starter kit charges a premium for generic life suggestions 
flimsy 
Overpriced and I actually tore it putting it together 
Lackluster... 
Too Expensive for a Fancy Cardboard Box 
Not Something That I Would Recommend 
Odd Design 
It's handy but flimsy

Pretty expensive cardboard 
Too expensive for what it is... 
Liked it until wrapping Christmas Presents

Not So Useful 
Don't waste your money 
New tool to learn 
Disappointing; Didn't Really Work for Me 
Destroyed my wrapping paper 
Promises To Be An Essential Everyday Product But For More Limited And Specialized Use 
Very limited applications 
Worked the first couple of times 
Worked great until the first time I dropped it 
DON'T REMOVE THE PLASTIC! 
Safe but very low quality. 
The Unkindest Cut.... 
Edited: this cutter didn't last 
Mixed Metaphor = Mixed Success 
Doesn't cut it 
Shredded funds 
Not recommended for Mac users - driver issues with wake from sleep 
Problem with power draw on print startup 
strong awful smell 
Luxurious Feel But Minimalistic Design Compromises Comfort 
Don't understand the purpose of these 
Uh notice the notice on the back... 
Dispenser with no cutter? 
I'd Skip It 
Misleading Description and Photo 
Attractive but not durable 
Picture Misleading... 
Not like the picture 
Had issues w/jamming buckling of staples inside 
Cute but difficult to operate 
Just about everything is wrong about this product! 
Esthetically Pleasing but REALLY Cheap Stapler 
Pretty but cheap 
Darn 
Attractive 
Good Luck Getting Rid Of Apps 
Spend A Few Dollars More And Be Happier 
I wanted something that would create great photo prints - this isn't it - adds lines to the print 
Good as long as you don't use windows 8 or apple 10.8x 
Poor ease of use destroys an otherwise solid wireless all-in-one 
It's okay but.... 
It was working OK until a paper jam 
Can't recommend it. 
I seem to have been unlucky enough to get a faulty piece 
Some quality and toner expense issues 
Not ready for prime time printer 
Good Ticket Stock Poor Templates 
Needs better design options and heavier paper 
Quality tear-away sheets; terrible and non-intuitive template design 
NON-INTUITIVE TEMPLATES AVAILABLE ON-LINE ONLY 
Confusion 
Expected better from this brand. Disappointed 
Long Time Uni-ball User Dislikes Them 
I don't get it 
Beautiful colors but nib sticks and ink smears 
Bold colors but disappointing overall. 
A Little Tricky to Get Paper to Catch 
Not too tough and annoying to load. 
Wireless connectivity intermittent 
Slightly better than ripoff inkjets 
Smear a lot not as high quality 
Doesn't Play Nice with Snow Leopard 
Not compatible with the other disc notebooks 
did not work with epson nx330 
You get what you pay for 
Almost complete garbage 
Adequate For Black Printing Only 
Beautiful Sluggish and Clumsy 
Not so fast 
So Far . . . No Good 
Scanner Error... 
Do NOT get this if you do scanning 
Snail pace picture printer 
Get the 545 instead 
buggy not intuitive not worth the cost of ink 
Nice solid little office or home office printer but can't remember date/time 
Not as easy to set up as I had hoped 
Good printer except for its very inefficient ink cartridge system! 
Doesn't Like Printing Photos on Photo Paper 
Excellent Printer Good Price 
Unusable? 
Just not for me... nice print quality but poor design and materials in my opinion. 
A little slow and loud; heavy too 
Way Overpriced Yet Decent Ink Cartridge 
Overpriced 
A Tale of Two Printers - and Two Different Levels of Customer Service 
Not A Good Mid-Back Executive Chair 
Excellent size but that's about it 
The ink cartridge issue overrides the positive aspects of this printer! 
Get what you pay for 
A Rare Miss for Pilot 
Nifty idea but not premium enough for the kind of people who care about notepads 
Weird 
Could be better 
Better in theory than practice 
Mediocrity 
Firmware Error in chip 
A pen is a pen is a pen 
This pen delivers the ink...but broke after a couple of weeks. 
Pilot Remains TOPS sorta 
If you're upside down in the rain... 
Floats writes when wet... just like a cheap ballpoint pen. 
I don't get it 
Not impressed 
Sharpens poorly 
Broke after a week 
Very Fast Sharpener that Lives a Faster Life 
It gets the job done sometimes satisfactorily. 
Poor Performance when compared to a Panasonic cordless phone connected to the same OOMA (telo) base unit 
Latency is a real problem...

Fun Idea With So-So Implementation 
Prints nicely BUT... 
Didn't work for me 
Do Not Pass GO. Do not collect. 
Poor quality scan 
Not So Super 
Needs to Come With Eraser 
Wish They Had Included Eraser 
Sharpens unevenly not much of a point 
laughably bad security 
Not effective for what it is inteded for 
Weak tape 
Not Going To Be Useful For Most People 
not for packing and shipping 
Unimpressive and poor for shipping 
A Scotch Tape That Seems Like A Good Idea But Offers Marginal Usefulness 
Ok for loaners .... those who don't return your pen! 
Pilot makes the best pens but not these.. 
Decent design but limited wireless range 
great idea mediocre execustion 
Too expensive and complicated 
Ridiculous 
Not impressed 
I found a better alternative 
Fits a Specific Audience Maybe

A clever idea but out of date 
There are better and less expensive alternatives 
I Don't Get The Purpose Of This Product 
Don't quite get it

This or a plain photo? 
Did not care for...

Too Clunky - Tries Too Hard 
One 'not very useful' box 
Dead bug in my box.... 
Means Well But Cheaply Made 
Nothing stands out. It's a pick-off-the-shelf dollar product 
it's colored scotch tape 
Not a replacement for decorated Duck Brand duct tape. 
Wobbly as heck! 
The magnets all popped off 
Over priced for limited usage 
So-so construction and not very useful

Flimsy and photo prints are of poor quality 
Cheap and warped 
Flimsy

Very light duty 
Not well built 
I Don't Get It 
Not very functional 
Not enough contrast 
Cheap 
Meh.  (I know crazy 'cuz how hard is it to make a 'meh' cork board?) 
The cork part is fine 
Cheap-looking cork board that cannot be hung only mounted with sticky tape that may not adhere to surface 
I guess you could call this an \off the wall\ review 
For those of us (you) that have nothing to do&#8230; 
Uses a Monday - Sunday set up instead of the more common Sunday - Saturday 
Calendar Begins with Monday. Ugh. Major Flaw for Month of March. Horrible Marker! 
Two serious flaws. 
Too small for family use. 
Very unfortunate. 
Don't even bother 
Love this type of board but this one has some flaws. 
Not terrible for the price but a few things make it hard to recommend.

Plastic covering feels cheap thin not heavy-duty 
Okay but not Wowed 
Poor quality 
Quality leaves much to be desired 
Consider the price carefully. 
One is just as good as another right? 
The utility of this is much in question. 
Looks OK but not that great functionally

A waste of paper 
Not useable by touch typists probably OK for hunt and peckers 
Only 4-10 sheets not 20! 
Too expensive not sturdy 
REVISED for your FYI! 
OK stapler but usless without staples 
Okay As A Throw Away 
No staples included but the skins are cool 
not good 
Just get a regular stapler and avoid hassles. 
Stapler is very low quality small and jams often.  Skins are cool but prefer ugly and functional to beautiful and frustrating. 
Heavy!

Pretty Labels That You Can't Print?

Super bright and functional but battery installation is a PAIN 
Big pain to change the batteries! 
Way too much work putting in the batteries 
Basically a disposable light good enough for what it is 
Not satisfied 
Not Worth the Price 
Disappointing 
Defective when received.
