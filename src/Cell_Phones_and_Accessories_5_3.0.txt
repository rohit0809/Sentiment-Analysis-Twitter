Small and good power output; some fit problems 
Know the limitations

Delicate and consumes too much space 
Significant change makes this cradle not as good as it used to be

Blackberry 8520 
it's ok 
DISAPPOINTED 
Wasn't for me 
A cell phone as anyone else. 
Not a smartphone pretty good if it were the year 2006

Bluetooth connectivity work well just needs some refinement for the sound quality.

Great sound & loud for music but not quite on par for calls 
eh it's alright 
Brilliant Color but Only Protects Against Scratches

Very thin fits a passport overpriced. 
Too dificult to apply. 
Case coul not fit the phone 
it's ok 
The best bluetooth that I've found so far but not perfect 
OK device *if* it was delivered w/ear buds - seller did not/will not provide 
Ok product but expensive (if purchasing it) and do you really need it? 
interesting concept poor execution 
It's *beeping* charging! Hope you have a *beeping* Iphone otherwise you're out of *beeping* luck. 
Needs more compatibility expensive with additional purchases. 
An \A\ for design but not sure if it's worth it for the $ 
Inventive but Impractical 
Very useful charging station with one catch... 
Almost a great product 
Charges perfectly but some design flaws hindered my love 
It charges 
Convenient tool...with an ugly design 
This Novelty Charger has a LONG way to go to be Useful! 
Good concept 
Another unfinished product hit the market. 
Okay for multiple phones not so much for one 
The Novelty Wears Off Quickly 
Great idea for a household with multiple cell phones BUT it can only be used for specific phones 
Nice with some major limitations. Very good for desk use. 
The \Power Sleeve\ doesn't add up to convenience or savings 
Not what I expected 
Similar to the Powermat Cheaper But With Similar Drawbacks 
Works Fine but has a couple limitations. 
Works OK But A Little Bit Inconvenient 
Charging Made Simple - But With A Tradeoff And Expensive 
A GOOD CHOICE FOR CHARGING MATS

Practical BUT... 
Basic Case. Decent Price. But I'm Just Not a Fan of Silicone Cases.

A little loose 
I won't purchase again! 
Only O.K.

Battery Cover Doesn't Fit as Well As Original - But Better Battery Life 
Very cute 
OK 
love the retractable 
Plastic grips are too fat

A good deal but there are better products out there 
The tape is fine 
Not so sticky 
Works good 
Not what i expected 
Plenty more tape than you'll probably ever need. 
Great Idea but could be better 
Useful I guess... 
It works 
Okay.... 
Its a nice watch when connected rest of the time its a paperweight. 
Weirdly interesting... It works better with OpenLiveView than with Sony's software. 
bad battery life 
ITS OKAY

Interesting Gimmick 
Screen not showing

Spudger review 
Simple but effective 
Terrible case! 
This case is a very good case and very sturdy. 
Works to stop scratches but no real impact protection. 
Some good some bad 
not the worst but not worth the money 
Serves its basic purpose 
OK but lots of  Problems with Voice Assist & Recognizing Commands 
WAY TOO BIG 
FM nice listener sound quality not great 
Clear sound but some annoying flaws 
good as a speakerphone for voice but not music 
Compact quick to connect great in 35 mph or slower city driving 
Really great speakers but voice recognition doesn't work! 
Great if you want to use it as a speaker phone 
Call & Text but not so much for Android... 
OK but not great 
Ok but not as good as hoped 
Not a bad Product 
Screen protectors 
Good bubble free film for the iPhone 4S but.... 
Amazing quality

Great price 
Great product bad replacement procedure 
customer service was nice enough 
Nice but wish it fit tighter...

Nice 
It would probably be OK if... 
Ok at best 
Its all right but you have to treat with extreme care 
GREAT CHARGER BUT CABLE DIDN'T WORK 
Works most fo the time with the iPad 3 
The cord broke down but the plugs lasting 
It was doing good until.... 
A bit touchy 
Cheap but worth the price? 
Car mount does it's job 
Disappointed 
Output is only 1.5A so it will work for phones but not tablets 
It Works but it's BIG! 
Useful but wish it were more so. 
Good Luck 
Nice cover for the price.

BAD then WORSE! 
A product with potential

Great Battery but not the best 
Great technology but not for my ear.

It's an OK headset 
WTH it is an open box item missing parts DO NOT BUY FROM INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTERS!

Updated Review - Rating Demoted from 4 Stars 
Just OK 
Great Indoor Earbuds Battery Could Use Some Work 
The form factor I've been waiting for but would prefer in-ear ... 
The Jabra SPORT Bluetooth is Awesome for Indoor Usage but Horrible for Outdoor Usage 
Weak Battery 
Good Bluetooth Headset with Limited Range 
Its ok 
Easy to use and good sound quality but drops the signal and the cord sticks to your neck 
Overall: Not Bad 
Product is nice 
Beware if you have small ears or older devices 
Keeps falling out 
Poor sound quality 
Jabra SPORT - not the best 
Great Features some poor funtioning 
Conditional pass..  please read. Buy Anker or Seidio 
initially good... doesnt hold up well under long term use. 
Case does not fit the phone 
so-so 
A bit of  a let down 
Pretty Good for the Price - low quality cover 
Back cover 
You get what you paid for

White iPhone Case 
cheap item 
Basic 
Just ok - hard to apply bubbles applicator not much help 
Wrong Belkin screen protectors 
Hard to line up to apply doesn't last very long 
OK 
Bubbles didn't go away 
Pricey but works fine. 
Screen protectors 
Okay 
It's not an actual calculator.

Phone case 
Pretty but not dependable 
Crazy 
yickes! 
nice little headset 
Sound quality not up to Jawbone standards BUT TELLS YOU THE CALLER'S NAME! 
Mixed performance 
Middle of the road price and performance 
Does NOT work with iPhone 4S and Siri 
A little expensive... 
Dubious microphone quality 
Screencover 
Cheap but inferior 
Nice starting package 
Decent Range 
Holds iPhone securely good quality; required app is the weak link 
Good idea killed by bad execution. works ** ONLY ** w/ LiveAction 
Tripod feature only real benefit. 
Some simplicity with some complexity 
Like the idea needs better support (from Apple?) to be useful. 
Not as helpful as I was hoping it would be 
not needed 
Good invention with limitations 
Neat idea; limited to Belkin's photo app 
I like the hardware.  The software is not so great. 
Live Action Camera Grip for IPhone 
EASY TO USE BUT.... 
Useful if iPhone is the Only Camera You Use 
Neat concept but loses points for price and app limitations 
Cool accessory but is there a need for it? 
Not bad but not impressive for the price 
Good product hobbled by proprietary app 
The grip is great. The app...not so much... 
good functional design but unnecessary 
IOS 5 upgrade makes your volume button to act like Camera button 
Makes the camera easier to hold but doesn't add much functionality 
Cute for the price! 
Pretty but broke easily 
It's okay. 
Windshield phone holder 
Cheap 
I have Mixed feelings - case is okay but customer service is Exceptional

BlueAnt Headlock Stereo Headphones 
Unpretentious 
Premium headphone but not my type of sound 
Great case 
Tiny

Works with Nortel T7316 
more charge duration needed 
Good Battery 
Very stiff. 
tip becomes mushy after use but other than that good stylus 
locked 
Touch is slow 
Love these but they don't work with iPhone 5 
Should you get another Blackberry?

Quality Varies w/ Diztronic

Plantronics over makes good headset. What happened to this one? 
underSTAND? 
Decent for the money 
Powering Down Downer 
Bulkier than holsters and the metal clip is harder to use than the plastic clips I am use to. 
Good deal for the money 
Not as expected

It might be a great battery but the phone might be the real problem  - Sprint is no help at all 
New battery makes phone stable still degrades faster than expected 
Nothing to brag about...

It Works 
Lasted a year. 
Not the best but good price 
ok 
Same downfalls but different

After several months I have a review...

Holds phone fine shakes too much for my liking. 
Great for navigation 
It can be improved 
Strong hold on dashboard but swivel and clamp are a bit finicky 
Hope you don't have a Nissan Altima or other similar dash style. 
Shaky and suction cup won't hold well in heat 
Doesn't fit Galaxy Note 3 with Otterbox Defender. 
Works on almost anything

Fits the iPhone 5 but not what I need it for which is the S3 (with OTTERBOX) and S4 
I wish I know where I put it
