Not As Good As Other Products Excessively Drying 
NOT the solution for EVERYONE...

Felt nice but I don't think it works any miracles. 
Nice Product Not All-natural 
Great for the colder months but it remains oily under the sun 
bio oil is OK 
Haven't Seen a Change Yet 
Not for me because it contains mineral oil - a petroleum by-product. 
Basic Ingredients Work Sometimes 
oil feels nice 
It's okay 
Does this product actually work? 
What's the harm? 
sweet smell 
Satisfactory but not stellar results

Not my favorite. 
Pass on this 
Much too stiff for the face 
Crystal clear with NO sediment or cloudy stuff!!!

Got moldy fast 
makes your hair dry 
ehh 
Long.  Hard to hang onto in shower.

Be Smart about When and How to use 
It's ok but not a magic.. 
Not the best Egyptian Magic Cream I have ever tried 
Not sure.. 
It's okay but definately not magical for me. 
I don't know about magic... 
Not such a good deal! 
Silky Smooth Legs 
Similar to using Vaseline very greasy 
It works sort of. But it's also kind of scary.

MY WIFE SAYS IT HAS A FISHY ODOR 
Great if you can get past the smell 
Does what it's meant to 
Not really my type 
lasts a long time but scent seems to change based on body chemistry 
It's not all that. 
OOOHHHH 
Chips and not true color 
It's not what it's supposed to look like 
Not really Tiffany blue 
audrey 
Got a completely different color than I ordered 
looks different in person 
burnt monster/beautiful 
would say i liked it but it REALLY was a pain in all ways 
Colors different from other covergirl products 
CoverGirl Creamy Natural Liquid Foundation 
alright mascara 
just okay 
Weights down lashes and a bit too hard 
Brush is way too FAT doesn't allow for detailed application 
covergirl lineexact liquid eyeliner 
Works great but broke out 
Beware if you have dairy or lactose issues 
a tad bit disappointed 
Not worth the money 
Smells yummy 
It's not better than a good moisturizer 
So So 
Just ok 
Just another gimic? 
I thought it worked. 
Works but not a good value 
exfoliates but no blackhead eraser for me 
Cleans Well - Not worth the cost 
\Eraser\ is a bit too potimistic of a word 
Been there before 
Name is misleading 
An expensive option for face cleaning. 
Good cleanser 
Okay acne and blackhead prevention...from Clean & Clear. 
What's an eraser? 
Does about the same as any other acne product over the counter... 
CLEANER but not an ERASER 
Forty Bucks Worth of CRAZY! (UPDATED) 
Great concept.... 
Good for prevention but doesn't erase them 
i think i'm allergic 
refreshing but doesn't do the trick 
Doesn't actually clear away the blackheads 
Makes your skin feel clean 
Not all it is cracked up to be 
Works okay... 
No blackhead eraser 
It Does Reduce Blackheads But... 
Good vibrations 
More of an exfoliator type product 
good price for a portable cleaner 
I don't see how this can be any better then scrubbing yourself 
Nothing to cheer about 
Good for skin massage not so good at removing blackheads 
Another not so good eye cream 
Not Great but Not Bad either.... 
It's ok 
not the best product for my skin 
Night Treatment is O.K.. 
lasts a long time 
RoC Multi-Correction Night Treatment - yucky ingredients 
it bit to harsh 
I Only Use 2 Colors! 
4 different sizes 
Okay for an inexpensive set. 
Cheap 
nail bruches 
Didn't notice any difference. 
It works..but please be careful 
Okay 
day one: notes from a peeled chicken 
Chest acne 
Not what I ordedred. 
Please be CAREFUL - Read this first! 
didn't do anything? 
Its okay 
Eh 
Fine but not worth the money 
Good as moisturizer 
Eh 
No significant difference but it didn't make redness worse 
serum 
Ok but not as expected 
Well it's not working for me as well as it is for other ppl but... 
Not Sure About This Yet . . . 
Purchased for my bleach fried hair... 
Cheap looking but does the job. 
nice 
HAIR DONUT 
For \Little\ Bun 
Received my product early 
Meh 
Can't Get It To Look Like Picture 
Meh 
Fun 
Mixed feelings 
Donut? 
Stink odor 
Too big of a bun for me.. 
Works with any type hair 
Just Okay 
Good End & Bad End 
OK - For the Price! 
whooah 
don't order in hot weather 
... 
Not strong enough for me 
Tingle Effect Wore Off Quickly 
Love it larger size brush is more stable and lasts longer 
Almost a really good mirror. 
Washed off pretty quickly 
Eh it's hair spray 
Almost too effective - have to use sporadically 
Okay but not the best! 
milkyway saga gold remy 
I tried many fragrance free shampoos and conditioners 
Not the best for my hair 
It's ok 
i have tried it its ok

False packaging

Disappointed

Oregano 
oil of oregano 1oz 
Not Strong Enough 
eh 
Not sure 
Good value for the size. 
worked for what i needed it for 
I like Glycerin 
Not for bubble bath 
great for skin horrible in hair. 
This is ok... 
Similar to Joyful Heart - charity shower gel benefiting the joyful heart foundation 
Nice designs 
Not what I thought it would be. 
Too small for most thumb nails 
Don't see the appeal. 
This stuff is hot hot! 
Not my fave 
its okay 
not bad 
dried up 
Still has parabins in it 
You get what you pay for! 
Scent is amazing but it doesn't last 
Okay if you have the patience for it 
Not what I should have bought 
Mixed Emotions 
its okay 
Product - Great. Company - Eh. 
So-so 
Don't expect a miracle 
Darker than I wanted 
Not as impressive as other Benefit products 
Works great if you use Mineral conealer for your eyes 
Don't get all the fuss 
Good for moisturizing; does not illuminate sheer coverage 
Did ok 
Unimpressive as foundation substitute. Holds promise as foundation primer. 
Odd product 
Seems to Work but Don't Expect Miracles. 
I'm giving this 3 stars but please read... 
Pretty effective on pimples need rechargeable batteries though and Tend Skin works just as well 
Mixed feelings on this one 
Great for disposable 
Eh.. 
Not bad not great. 
ehh sketchy! 
Worked for a while 
Overpriced for the standard system style effectiveness 
Works for me but is kind of like flipping a coin between Clear Skin or Not 
so painfull... 
ok 
easy to use 
Get a Sample If You Can 
Good 
GREAT SHINE but takes too long to dry 
It's ok 
Nice scent but a bit too greasy 
average hand cream smells good if you like figs 
a little too fragrant and thick for my taste 
Decent but somewhat greasy.... 
frenchtoast 
ok - but probably won't buy this agin 
not confident I got good value 
Pleasant smell but rather thick and heavy consistency 
So so 
Hard To Shake Up 
It's ok 
Works but is messy. 
Not impressed 
It's okay 
not bad 
meh 
Good BUT 
Works great 
So-so 
Very 'absorbing'...if you need that... 
Still awaiting a final verdict. 
It's okay.... 
Great for some 
Makes a good deodorant! 
eh 
Regular - Not so amazing 
Too ashy 
Packaging is horrible but product is worth it 
I don't' notice a difference w/ this product. 
Nothing Really Special 
hmm not the same 
Kind of deceiving 
I dont like this as much as covergirl 
its ok 
Not as dark as other products I've used 
Cheap plastic bonnet....scratchy 
Too hot!! 
Pretty waves not durable 
Serves its purpose but could be better 
Pops off a narrow hair dryer nozzle 
Hair diffuser 
It is not Universal 
Fits but keeps slipping off 
Loved for a while then was too harsh 
Meh 
sealing serum 
Darker color than expected 
Color looks a bit old 
It's Ok 
Not Sure 
I'm not getting the hype 
Made me break out

Love the smell 
A little disappointed 
not bad 
Wasn't as Matte as I'd Hoped 
Strong nails! 
It's okay 
Very nice base coat with the added benefit of a strengthener. 
Switched to original

Not Bad 
works but not pleasantly 
Foaming? 
Nice Color 
Okay

It's ok 
so far soo good 
Decent lotion but wouldn't buy it again 
Doesn't moisturize well. 
Very moisturizing & lasts a long time 
First time user 
Illuminating experience! 
not too impressed 
Great for sensitive skin but a little watery for me. 
Mixed Feelings 
A little color change but not much shine 
Yacht Man Blue By Puig Eau-de-toilette Spray 3.4 Ounce 
Yacht Man Blue 
Not bad for the price 
Smells nice but... 
Good Fragrance 
Acceptable softness with heat but unimpressive 
was okay. 
Decent foot cream but too greasy 
Too &#34;Perfumey&#34; for me 
Neutrogena Body Emulsion was better 
Not as good as I thought 
No Added Value Over Using Advanced Night Repair Alone. 
Great! But wheel sucks 
Better than cleanser but not impressed 
licensed cosmetologists review 
Ok I guess.. 
Ehh ok... 
Ok I guess 
Good 
Just ok mine was weak

Definately have used better buffers. The price was nice 
The Body Shop Nail Block 
Mediocre results 
Ok for the price 
The price 
Ouch! 
Get a Smaller One for Effectiveness 
Too harsh for my extra sensitive skin 
Facial Tool. 
Works well for certain kinds of blemishes. 
better than hands but not effective enough 
Mehhh. Just OKAY 
Ok 
Ouch 
Works if you have a certain type of skin / pore 
Doesnt get out tough whiteheads 
Excellent doohickey 
Not great for really small blackheads 
Don't like the smell. 
No sharp edge 
Not as sharp as I thought 
kinda big 
I need something with a little more of an edge. 
Pretty Good 
Zinc may not be for everyone. 
Okay...without makeup

Wig Cap (2 Pack) Color Neutral 
What you see is what you get. 
It is okay 
Not the best not the worst 
grade foam 
Slippery Dome 
It's fine I guess. 
Nose Smashed 
Sure it will work 
Its okay 
Avg brush 
The ingredients are very harsh 
Didn't live up to expectations 
Not recommended.. 
Not worth the money for my use. 
Better than any Sally Product 
Ok I guess 
what can I say 
Teeny tiny. 
Almost satisfied 
not like my old ones but still ok 
Would rather have all larger rollers that are streamed. 
Old-fashioned electric rollers 
Used to be the best but the formula has changed in the past year 
Not bad but somewhat disappointing overall 
Never wants to come off! 
The brush is too big 
Why does everyone like this product? 
Lovely mascara not so lovely brush 
More cons than pros equals barely average product. 
Hmmmmmm...its definitely not for straightening your hair from poofy to silk straight 
It's ok 
Good for length not so much for thickness 
Works but was hoping for perfection 
Not sure 
Can't really tell 
might not buy again 
I like it 
Does have good scrub not too soft It's okay 
Smells Great 
OK 
ok 
Nice concept... 
not suitable for dry climates

Not as bright as I thought 
It's not as great as other rating stated. 
Ok but not great 
Very disappointed in this product... 
Nice nails.

Not one of the best Japanese face wash I have tried. 
Doesn't remove makeup very well 
It's just okay 
Good Product

Obagi 
Still thinking about this one 
Still trying it 
Highly recommended just not for me 
Burned my Face 
It does good to even out darkness 
Does not glide on as smoothly as I hoped it would 
Good if you are not using water proof makeup too expensive

It's just a beautiful bottle. 
candy and flowers 
good price 
Cannot complain too much 
This shampoo is ok but  not great 
Smells great! 
Good but take precaution 
It's just another loofah! 
Not quite the soft pouf I wanted but high quality item 
Just ok 
Typical loofah but the cord is a bit annoying 
Exfoliates well but more suitable for the body 
Haven't used Yet 
meh 
Not worth it 
Lovely Smell 
Worked For My Hair At First 
Greasy.  Not conditioning.  Pass. 
A good blowout spray 
It's a Clip 
Does the job 
Good hold but the hinge can pull out your hair! 
Kept hair up but pulled it out too 
Not so great for bigger sections of hair 
Do the Job 
Not the best.... 
Some of these work great others leak 
They work 
Okay 
mmm I wouldn't call it a miracle... but it's ok 
Bulky Dryer 
Nice product 
Okay but not as good as a flat iron 
Results May Vary Between Users 
I wish I could rate it higher but I just can't 
A flat iron is easier..... 
Heavy Hairdryer 
Stylish but takes practice. 
Smells Great! 
Ok but not invisible 
Matches skin tone but on the fence... 
It's ok 
Excellent wear.  The color does not come out like it looks in bottle. 
very lightweight 
Decent straightner but you get what you pay for 
There's good and bad... 
a pretty unit... 
Good but not for a 1st iron... 
heavy yet underpowered in both heat and velocity 
Tresemme Philips Hair Dryer 
I like No Poo Conditionet better 
Disappointment

Good quality product but didn't perform the way It hought it should 
Just as nice as can be... 
Good sponge but a little rough 
Soapy 
Not the greatest 
was a bit too greasy for me 
It's alright 
So So 
It is what it is..probably just me 
It's nothing special... 
Was not tightly sealed. Got all over my clothes. 
Too filmy and light 
Gets You Clean Leaves Your Shower Stall Dirty 
So so hairspray 
Disappointed 
Three Stars 
not too greasy 
Not for acne prone skin 
May be a LONG term effect thing? 
Grow Edges 
Decent 
Vanish doesnt completely do the trick 
Havent really used it much 
WHAT % OF 100% PURE EMU OIL IS VITAMIN E? 
Nice moistureiser 
The mirror is beautiful...but... 
It's ok! 
Price was high 
good for traveling 
Decent Replacement. Worth the money however. 
BIG cheap looking 
great for winter 
Super bright! Hurts eyes a bit. 
Well... 
too small 
TINY but works... 
Better than I thought but sad it's SO small 
Hard to see myself 
What I Expected 
The Brush 
Excellent color but does not rub in well 
Maybe I'm using it wrong... 
Ok 
A bit disappointed 
I had tried another one without the spf and liked it better 
Good coverage but... 
Ok product STUPID BRUSH 
Right color 
Disappointed 
I bought this thinking it would be good to carry in my purse 
Made my skin a little dry 
Not What I Thought It Would Be 
results temporary 
Pretty good 
Works sort of for a while anyway 
I rub it on my finger then apply under eyes... 
Chilled spoons do it better 
Average 
Accidental purchase

Didn't notice a change 
Works sloooowly 
It works okay 
It's ok. 
Not Exactly Life-Sized 
too thin? 
Hard to Clean 
It's ok 
ok 
I don't like this product

Worked well for short time 
It works for what I wanted but isn't like the razor cutters that the professionals use. 
Good but dark 
It seems good. 
smells terrible 
Stinky 
Works but... 
Soothes painful ears -- but not for sensitive noses! 
Good color lousy consistency. 
Odd color but I like it. 
Just OK 
Not as great as I expected.. 
Not sure now 
Couldn't tell if it worked 
Too many chemicals! !!! 
Works well not fond of scent 
reddish brown did they say? 
It's too brassy 
LIGHT brown? Maybe later but not at first! 
Not any better than a regular dryer 
Nice concept but still needs work. 
Works well but... 
Limited use hairdryer for long hair only 
Great Comfortable Dryer But Not a Fan of the Attachments 
Average Hairdryer - accessories unnecessary 
Great Dryer...Lose the Cartridge 
Heavy duty blow dryer but that's it. 
A Dryer and Hair Conditioner Into One 
Not really for short or simple hair 
LIght weight... 
Great dryer don't care for the conditioner 
Say No... To Wax Build-up 
Just an ordinary dryer but more expensive! 
run of the mill straightener with a few problems. 
OK but needs improvements 
Cool functions - useful attachment - not the most powerful straightener. 
Conditioner: Good idea in theory - bad idea in practice 
SO-SO FOR HER 
healthy infusions straightener 
it did a decent job 
It's fine for the price 
Not impressed with this straightener. 
Wahl Healthy Infusions 
green rubber scented non-lathering stone 
I Like It

It is not for everyone 
Not Exactly What I Expected 
Not Exactly What I Expected 
Smells good...as do all their products. 
Not Overly Impressed

I was afraid to use this due to the glycerin in itbut now I have a new respect for it!! 
Mild toner 
Very strong smell 
Shampoo 
Good but not Great! 
Fair 
Sprayer broke on first use 
Okay

Nice scent kind of greasy 
Smells nice goes on well. 
Heavy cream works well for very dry hands. 
Pleasant but not that rejuvinating 
Not my favorite... 
A nice cream but not so natural 
AZO yeast pills 
So-so 
ok to buy 
Just so... 
Not impressed.

I am not sure!? 
ehh okay 
Slow but works 
This stuff works but you should know that... 
OK 
Just OK 
Nothing extra \special\ 
Almost Adequate and Okay 
Nice light lotion but won't treat dry skin 
My hair looked oily at the end of the day 
Average shampoo 
Poor Packaging 
I don't know about this. 
dry pads don't take my eye makup off! 
They work for the most part 
I want to love it. 
This is for old people mind you 
I am NOT sure... 
I've used the entire thing 
On the fence 
Okay 
Just OK 
pretty good 
not sure what it's supposed to be \repairing\ ... 
Decent but not as good as Aveeno 
Compared to Goat's Milk Lotion 
NOT A FAN OF VASELINE PUMPS 
Okay 
Not Quite Intensive Care 
Fragrance-free doesn't mean odor-free 
Big huge bottle of lotion 
Fresh Scent Average Performance 
Smells like honeydew 
Fine moisturizer but scent is too strong for me 
Effective But Scent (Although Pleasant) Is A Bit Too Pronounced For My Personal Taste 
Pleasant Smelling with a Twist 
Aloe Me 
Huge bottle of lotion at a good price 
medium moisturizing product 
Fleeting Results 
Oat Extract Lotion 
Oil and Oats 
Need to use more than expected to get full effectiveness 
One of the few Vaseline's with an OK scent. 
Loathe the fragrance 
A Little Too Light 
- 
Not as good as I thought it would be 
short term benefit 
Unpleasant smell 
Okay 
What happened to this product? 
Lotion fragrance and not that that great 
Not as emollient as expected 
Of the 3 Total Moisture scents this one is my least favorite 
Mild light and inexpensive lotion.  Good for general light use for slightly dry skin. 
Underwhelmed 
Dove Cream Oil Alright for the Price 
Hmm.. 
Wrong Combination 
Less scented but not unscented 
Contains FRAGRANCE 
Product is okay but packing leaves much to be desired 
More lotion-like than body wash 
Very Little Lather.. 
Nice product but scent could use some work. 
There Is No \Burst\ 
Will stick with Deep Dove Moisture 
Decent moisturizer but it smells like a 1970s aftershave 
Disappointed

Nice color but the cream blush felt a mite sticky and wore off quickly 
Alright 
Pretty Shade in the bottle but... 
UGH! 
The original formulation was a lot better

I used it on my Weave and on my hair ... 
Expected more 
OK 
Moisturizer or Conditioning Mask? 
Uuumm? 
great stuff strong smelling and it dissovles into a green ... 
Not bad not that great either. 
Liked the Old Formula Better 
My disappointment was a surprise 
OK conditioner weird curling results 
Good shampoo overall price is too high 
I can't tell the difference 
Unfortunate use of silicone 
Not as unique as claimed 
Average results at best 
Ok shampoo for curly hair 
My hairdresser knows 
It's Alright 
A fine shampoo but don't put too much stock into the \smoothing\ claim. 
Just Average 
Not Really For Me 
OK shampoo but friz control isn't great 
Not impressed...it's like a 'normal' shampoo. 
Not the best 
Can feel a difference in the DRY summer air 
There are better Pantene's out there 
Thick means your hair cuticle course hair not if you have typical thick hair like a lot of hair cuticles! 
Just an average conditioner 
OK BUT NO DIFFERENT THAN USING REGULAR PANTENE PRODUCTS 
dissappointed. 
eh 
wish it was brighter... 
Illumination is heat generation 
It's okay but the light is too bright 
hard to use doesn't foam much 
Off-color 
Just okay 
actually messed up my back with this stupid hook 
works but caused breakage with my brittle hair 
Won't Stay Put 
NOT QUITE WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR 
Do not work as well on slippery hair 
not happy with the color 
Nice hairpins but bend and slide out 
Its okay.. 
Seems to cool eyes 
VERY GOOD LOTION FOR EXTRA DRY SKIN 
Good product 
Bargus 
If you're looking for a natural non-toxic solution look elsewhere 
Nothing special 
FEEL LIKE I'M IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE 
To Be Determined 
kinda medicinal 
Sunscreen 
It's just 'okay' 
Good Product Bad Packaging 
Pretty Good 
It did its part 
Almost perfect 
My 8x counter-top is about the same 
Sticky Shampoo 
Black Castor oil shampoo 
Redkin is the best... not sure about color extend... 
It works just a bit pricey 
More like a body spray.... 
Have used it 3 times 
does nothing to hormonal acne 
Insanely Black tanning lotion 
New to tingle 
Love it except for one ingredient. 
Ok 
Bought for a friend... 
GEL FLEX TOE STRETCHERS 
I like the older Noxzema better this one causes slight burning sensation in sensitive areas 
Nice smell but way too overpriced for doing practically nothing. 
Good product a bit too pricey for the size 
Thin texture 
Not much results but no alleric reaction. 
Dull 
Too light 
Very sheer 
Looks nothing like the picture 
Its ok 
This set is ok 
ok 
Neutral 
It's okay 
being young would be better 
Works bad packaging 
Lightened dark brown to medium golden brown. 
Didn't really see results 
Worked but burnt my skin 
cuticle kit. 
First Impressions 
The size of the product is injustice to its price 
Just Ok 
Joico K Pak Shampoo 
OK Product 
It's okay. 
Passable but Could Be Better 
Lashem 
Returned ... Didn't like 
works well but is expensive 
OK but not great. 
strong smell - oily 
it is what it is 
Not sure about this 
Nothing out of the ordinary 
Original Hyalaronic Acid Serum 100% 
Is it 100% 
Does The Trick! 
??? 
What's the big deal? 
Not sure it helped my skin. 
OK FOR PRICE 
Smooths 
Hmmmm 
Not Bad 
it is what it is... 
Verdict Still Out! 
Zit zapper 
Didn't notice much change 
Greasier than expected 
Scent doesn't last 
Good but not great. 
Good moisturizer but the Blood Orange scent is nicer 
Somewhat dissappointed 
Smells nice feels cool 
it works but I think I can do better 
Good soap great scent 
Very tiny 
Smells great runs not very long lasting 
Wanted to like it... 
Pretty but.... 
natural but not a lot of staying power 
Okay Bath Brush 
It's okay 
A Note On Color 
Great color...however very messy! 
Quite nice 
I didn't notice any improvement 
It does what is does 
An OK mask and scrub 
it's decent 
Good mask for acne prone oily skin 
Pretty good; not blown away 
ok but nothing special for the price 
work decent but why the parabens? 
Good moisturizer but makes skin shiny. 
Sex In The City 
It's ok 
Ehhh 
Great price 
Smells Great...Controls Shine 
Not what i had hoped 
I thought this was awesome but.... 
Not accurate grits 
Matte not moisturizing but good coverage 
It works like a charm at first. 
So-so but... 
On the fence 
love the color. 
Barbie would be happy 
eh.. 
Helps but not dramatic 
Hard to hold and get leverage 
No complaints this is a pretty generic product 
I bought the day and night brightening lotions and 
The colors all get mixed 
very very small 
This product is very small good for nail art 
Tiny super tiny but not bad at all... 
It's Okay For The Price 
Not what I pictured... 
Gets the job done 
Not 1200!!! 
The product does not stay in your hair until washed ... 
Gloppy. 
It will do 
Color is more purple an I thought 
Light light grey 
literally \clearly\ pink 
On the fence 
Very sheer 
The color is not what I expected 
Not my favorite color 
Sheer 
Ok but..... 
Hard to apply 
Love Shellac 
Iced colors a little more \troublesome\ 
It's not you it's me... or my skin tone... or something... 
Good polish 
It's ok 
Not enough product for the money. 
thanks! :) 
Not for tightlining/waterlining 
boring black-blue 
Meh. 
Good at first but... 
Worthwhile if you do NOT have sensitive skin 
Not yet sure if this is going to work for me 
It May Work.... 
Pretty Happy with Eyelash Grow 
Couldn't continue use due to itchy lids 
Couldn't tell a difference 
Just okay. 
Iritating to the eyes for what little difference it makes 
Not A Product For Me 
What price beauty? 
Very slight difference 
Good luck if you have the patience 
The \caution\ statement startled me 
Not a big difference 
I wish I could say more... 
OK.. 
Too Soon To Say 
I was allergic but like the idea of a non-Rx lash grower 
After 6 weeks a bit more growth 
More a conditioning product than a growth product 
Must take time . . . 
Envyderm Eyelash Enhancement 
Ok for a Non-Rx 
Not sure if it works or not 
Is it worth the price? 
Not bad but nothing great 
Irritates sensitive areas 
Just ok 
Not the worst but would not buy again 
Where's the Carrot? 
Yes To Tomatoes Conditioner 
Compliments the Shampoo Nicely 
Too heavy for my skin and seems to take forever to be absorbed 
Not for me 
Not for my skin type 
MIght break you out still trying to decide 
Yeasy to put on the eye 
Just Okay 
Not my favorite 
Yes to Tomatoes 
Smooth texture seems to work well enough for some things 
Yes to Tomatoes 
Just meh 
damaged but good product 
no mirror 
Extensive Colors No Staying Power 
good 
3D 
Really pasty 
Halfway Pure 
I expected more 
HAVE USE IT AND HAVEN'T SEEN ANY NOTICEABLE IMPROVEMENTS 
Ewwwww the tangles and matting!!! 
its ok 
useless 
Good enough for lghter skin ..\ok \ for black girls 
For a little thing... 
Not alot of power but PERFECT travel size 
Works great and thankfully they changed design a little 
It's ok not great 
Kind of disappointing to be honest 
Lightweight moisturizer but not for all skin types 
I liked the product but not the smell 
Light weight & Sunscreen Coverage = Modrate Moisturizing 
Average quality moisturizer 
a bit too thick for my taste 
GOES ON SMOOTHLY 
Okay for sunscreen. Not my favorite moisturizer. 
Not what I expected but still good 
OK but not better than my usual 
Good moisturizer
