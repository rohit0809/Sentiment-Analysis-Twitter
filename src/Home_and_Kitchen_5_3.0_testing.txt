Good enough for the price 
Not great for candy making 
$6.99 regular food thermometers only go up to 220 degrees Fahrenheit 
Worked great until I made caramel 
Disappointed 
Just OK 
Some problems but a good basic thermometer 
Suction cups don't work after awhile 
Works after adding an additonal suction cup 
Needs better suction 
like it mostly 
Smaller than the earlier version 
Doesn't stick to the sink 
Should be listed as sink accessory holder 
WILL NOT STICK 
Good holder 
Does not anchor in sink 
Doesn't stick 
It's OK 
holder 
Like it but flimsey 
Works sometimes. 
Three Stars 
They will do the job if you pump enough. 
I love this product but the shipping price is outrageous. 
It works... or it doesn't... 
Gets the job done just a pain to pump sometimes... 
Cool but sticks down into the soda 
Loud Chopper 
Works but very cheap! 
Ok 
It works well but not great. 
Good machine 
mini cuisinart  not too sharp 
Useful but the engine burned out 
A fragile beauty 
THIS THING IS SO LOUD! 
noisy! 
smashes more than it chops 
Works alright but has some flaws 
Flimsy blade construction 
NOT BAD 
Great for small tasks but didn't last a year 
It's a chopper / grinder not a food processor. 
A chopper not a REAL food processor 
It woks so-so 
Good but not as economical as rolls 
save your money order the rolls and specialty items 
The product is great but I'm not a fan of the company 
really thought it was a much bigger roll 
Expensive 
Mis-Leading Size Measurement 
Excellent! 
scratches over time 
product quality good but ivory color not

Not bad 
not what it's cracked up to be.... 
Pretty but average 
Good product - but don't buy white 
Poor results for baked goods 
Definitel worth over a hundred bucks... 
Old Fashioned way to spend money 
It's difficult to wash it since it's narrow and long.  . 
All glasses are not uniformed 
Beautiful and Functional 
Used to be the best...now a little to be desired 
Doesnt Swing but opens cans well 
Handle grips fall off 
Shame on Amazon! 
How can the same openers be so different! 
Worked When It Stayed On \Track\ 
Solid and Functional but what have you done in the last 50 years? 
Pricey! Great for Spices 
Can't reuse 
attractive but tempermental for canning 
Great vacuum... but so far don't like the bagless/hepa combo 
I thought Hoover was the best? 
A mixed bag 
Too noisy for my taste 
LOUD 
Still undecided 
didn't notice a difference 
This model not worth the extra cost. 
Jury's Still Out 
Not The Fan To Get For 90 Degree Temps! 
Expensive but perhaps worth the price 
Like so many others great while it works! 
Costly to operate 
Two order one worked... 
As we are doing remodeling and needed bedroom air cleaners 
Updated review: Its gets noisy over time. 
Stopped Working

Does the job but rather noisy 
Flimsy 
Ok but not great. 
Nordic Ware Universal 8 Cup Double Boiler 
Functional Double Boiler Insert 
Hard to Scrape Out Broiler Pan 
It is a Poor Substitution for a Double Boiler but the Best one I've found for Cheap 
Nice but difficult to handle 
THESE ARE JUST OKAY 
Burned part of the holder Lodge Striped Hot Handle Holders/Mitts Set of 2 
not so special mitts 
Useful but not as good as they used to be 
Okay buy 
Prefer the sillicone ones... 
Good fit decent value should be more heat resistant 
Ok but... 
Not so hot 
Well made top quality but... 
Small for ends of pots and pans handles 
silicone may be better? 
Doesn't Hold 13.25# Turkey 
Observations using this roasting pan. 
A bit thin 
Lighter weight than Grandma's roaster! 
Chipped after two uses 
it is not the quality your mom's one had 
MADE IN MEXICO NOT USA 
Cheaply made compared to the older models. 
Manufacture defect have to order another.  sigh... 
Pretty lightweight for a roaster 
Good product poor shipping 
Wouldn't buy the same vacuum again 
not bad but not very good. 
Decent Entry-Level Juicer

Slightly Messy 
Decent for a first juicer 
Poorly designed.  Better systems exist 
Leaks and Spits 
Pretty good until it died. 
Not so good 
Not the size I was expecting even though this has the correct serial number 
You get what you pay for 
Not much to say. 
Not Exactly \Universal\ 
i am sure filter is ok 
Works somehow loud and inconvenient 
These ARE NOT original pre filters 
Depends where you buy it 
The item is fine but... 
Works as advertised 
Good enough for light jobs with some disadvantages 
Needs Some Tweaks To Make it 5 Star 
Half good - Half bad 
Handy but Needs Some Improvement 
Vacuum Belts 
they mark easily 
If you're looking to \buy American\ don't buy this!

Great Idea 
Why Did Farberware Change the Shape? 
Too small for burners 
balance is not good 
farberware quality not what it used to be 
good except plastic handle gives off fumes when hot 
Adequate at best 
I love Farberware !! 
Heavy 
It looks beautiful but... 
How many people does it take to make coffee?? 
Finicky but useful 
We shared one happy year together.. 
2 yr old. Died today. RIP. 
Not That Good 
Too pricey 
NOT GOOD WITH EGGS 
Too big for my Induction Cooktop burners 
It works fine but.... 
Cooks very well but the handle is not comfortable. 
Gotta watch the heat! 
great construction poor engineering 
Awkwardly shaped 
A workhorse but buy the one with the loop... 
WRONG ITEM 
Stainless can pit 
Do not use as a sauce pan (use only as a saucier) 
all-clad construction but bad engineering 
Not \fit\ for my pan 
Looks over function -- right here! 
Heavy for daily home kitchen use. 
I like 'em (now) 
Super Nice- Doesn't Grip well 
it's so sturdy that it's too heavy 
It's Quality BUT!!! 
OK but expensive and needed to return 1st set 
Works but Does Not Get A Lot of Points for Design. 
Purchased because of the reputation 
Does the job but hard to clean 
A fine example of a nonstick grill pan - but nonstick grill pans are a flawed concept.  Also - it's not \clad\. 
Not LTD but decent for aluminum 
Not \LTD\ as shown tho decent 
Smallish cooking surface and not great on smooth cooktops 
Perfect for bacon perhaps 
Nice Knives 
Mediocre Knives 
Beware the scissors! 
Sleek Machine Good Brew but Overrated 
Flimsy especially for the price... 
Unpredictable

The Picture is Misleading 
Lids don't fit! 
Lids lose their seal quickly 
Bowls are small can be used to serve to 2 persons MAX 
Glass storage 
Lids Leak - Not Airtight - Lid is Flimsy 
If only the lids fit snugly 
Updated Review 
Decent set could do with better quality lids 
Great bowls awful lids 
Adequate 
Alright 
Very good but slipery when taking it out of the oven 
Smaller than I thought 
Can't get the lids off without spilling 
Nice 
A few changes could improve this line 
I had to struggle with the lids. 
RECTANGULAR lids LEAK!! 
Lids Leak 
Good and not so good 
Great dishes but putting the lids on the bowls is hard! 
They broke upon arrival! 
10 pieces includes the lids actually 5 storage containers 
They are ok 
great until you break them 
Glass containers are great but some lids don't fit well 
Chipping around the top rim. 
I used to swear by Pyrex - maybe not so much now! 
inconsistent lids or glassware 
A perfect assortment 
pyrex bowls 
Not Strong enough... 
Be Carefull in . . . 
strong breeze but loud 
loud little powerful fan 
Noisy but effective 
Have 2 of these - and 2 different experiences
