It's ok but I liked a regular weekly planner better for a baby. 
Needs clearer AM & PM 
Expensive and Somewhat Limited Format 
This is fine ... but I haven't used it. 
Great Concept. Expensive Book 
Cute colorful but more of a toy then a teething soother 
Ok. 
Your baby needs to be old enough... 
Cool idea 
Could be great 
Just OK. 
Mixed feelings 
My daughter hates this 
Mediocre quality 
co-sleeper sheets 
Had to replace it 
The best option out there but still not perfect 
Easy to use! 
Poor Quality Control 
The best of it's kind but not the best option 
Not as good as I had Hoped 
It's okay... 
So-so 
Okay Product 
It works ok I guess 
Worked for a while... moving on now 
Nice now but.... 
Mixed Reviews 
You get what you pay for 
Doesn't fit my crib well enough for daily use but found another use for it 
Ok not amazing 
Great idea... just not fabulous for convertable cribs 
Rough after washing. 
It is waterproof but a nightmare to put on. 
Nice concept execution could be better 
Not as helpful as you'd think 
Does not fit all crib types 
Curls up after just a couple of washes 
Eh. 
Works but not very necessary so far 
Preferred the old design more 
A little warm 
Not as helpful as expected 
Brolly is better 
If you can't beat 'em join 'em! 
it's ok 
Does Not Work For Heavy Cords (like Power Bars) 
Too hard to remove even for adults 
No one in your house will ever get to your plugs again 
Works with some cords but pain to install. 
Works well but not exactly baby proof 
Too small 
HUGE covering very bulky 
Ok but enormous easier to just get a power strip with longer cord. 
Not fully baby proof 
Works Bigger Than Expected 
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000046S3W/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3 
Product may be a good product... if you can put it together 
Half of the ones we ordered worked and the other half did not 
Difficulty installing 
Seem Safe 
Awkward to use 
Less Comfortable to Use Than Safety 1st Nail Clipper 49523/49539 
great concept wish it was more accurate 
Watch Baby's Head with Those Corners! 
Considering Returning It 
You can do better 
Loved it at first but not so much later 
it will NOT make a regular octagon 
Possibly dangerous for under 1 year 
Great toy... for the hearing impaired 
Nice Music 
too loud 
Quality Sound and They Like It 
Solidly built but not much interest from baby 
Genius idea but needs improvement 
Depends on what you want from the toy 
Okay 
Not So Great For Younger Siblings 
way to heavy!! but good 
Love the music. 
It's cool 
Overpriced Loud and Boring 
Comfy but I wish it stayed in place better 
My son loves Thomas but the potty seat scares him! 
Missing some parts 
Maybe better for girls? 
Ok--not great for boys 
Love them but can't clean them 
Smells nasty after a while 
Ok but slides around a little 
I play it with more than he does. 
Good value for the money 
Fun but smells toxic 
doubt i would have bought if seen in person 
A little weak in the legs 
Be prepared to help your baby 
Rear wheels difficult to turn 
huge but baby doesn't like it 
It is huge! 
Baby likes it BUT... 
slopes toward the center 
Good except bottom is pretty hard 
not quality I expected; not a good napping pack n play 
Not worth the money due to the flaws 
Great but lacking medium flow nipples 
ok until now! 
Great Concept 
Gerber Prefolds 
absorbency 
Handy and As Reliable as Anyone Can Expect 
Just OK but it's what we needed... 
Works O.K. but not Wowed! 
Nice for some but no longer necessary 
Super Loud 
Ok... but I replaced with a double pump. 
It's LOUD but gets the job done for OCCASIONAL use! 
Decent gate but annoying door release and very narrow 
Great gate if you're not planning to use extensions. 
I like the crib but........ 
Great for small spaces and travel 
Okay for little babies........ 
Not the best but all there is 
fits fine but so rough &amp; scratchy 
Not as great as I thought it would be 
Toxic smell 
Our daughter prefers the Playtex 
Okay bottles...don't help with spit up though! 
Good bottles but fast flow and leaks 
Great bottles if they work 
Not that thrilled 
Alright bottles 
Not As Pleased As I Thought I'd Be. 
Popular but can be a hassle! 
My son hated them.. 
Okay 
worked 50% of the time... 
Love the nipple hate the leaking 
Love the pump BOTTLES ARE TRASH!!!! 
Not the greatest 
So-so 
An ok pump 
Not all breasts are made alike 
Little fingers are eventually able to figure out that it's fun to pull off though 
ok 
I think they fixed the cheap tape problem 
Good if your kid does not peel it off. 
Too short 
Corners fall off 
It works 
It's okay for what I needed it 
Color is Perfect Quality is Just Okay 
Good not great 
stroller connectors 
Good concept but BEWARE! 
A Good Booster but Not the Perfect Solution 
Nice looking OK in effectiveness 
meh 
Tape provided is annoying to use! 
Measure before you buy! 
Second try... 
Mixed Feelings....You Decide 
not a great seat for boys 
Seems comfy but messy! 
not for a 1 year old 
What a mess. 
Design was a bit off-putting for toilet training toddler 
Liked it but defective 
Just okay 
Great price super-cute just really small 
All Scuffed Up!  :( 
This would be great without the splash guard 
Too Hard 
I Had to Buy a Second One Because My Twins Fought Over the Right to Sit on it 
Cute and shiny 
Good one but didn't work for us. 
Big piece of plastic. 
it hurts my 2 yr olds bum. 
So-So potty chair for us 
Okay 
Too short 
Get the Summer Infant instead 
Ok but not for us. 
Needs Taller Splash Guard 
It works fine but 
Nothing great 
It's easy to clean but 
Go with a potty seat instead! 
it's only OK 
Bottles are Great but Don't Really Need the Nipples.... 
Don't Have this Product but 
Product is fine price is too high 
Functional but not asthetically pleasing 
serves it's purpose but not gentle on baby's skin 
not waterproof 
Serves purpose doesn't hold up well 
Hard to Clean 
Was fantastic until the seam kept splitting causing slow leaks 
Tub has strong plastic smell 
Nice but one design flaw 
Lasted six months 
Great concept but quality is hit or miss 
Not for our daughter 
Better for a baby splash bin than tub 
Good til its Gone 
Not great not bad 
good value 
You get what you pay for 
good support  too harsh 
Good for strollers and swings but not car seats 
Great but better one for less at Target 
Okay but not worth it for the price. 
won't stand up bad twist ties 
Okay but why spend time with twist ties.... 
Beware of third party items 
They're okay 
Nothing spectacular but nice backup 
Do the job but could be improved 
use but 
Thick enough to see under clothes. 
OK but disposables are better 
only ok 
Quite small and retain shape poorly 
Okay 
Great idea in theory... 
Easily saturated and not for mothers who leak lots 
Nice stool but doesn't work for me 
Good but tips easily and is a safety hazard 
Does what it says 
great idea... but execution needs work 
Don't fit 
Maybe this possible solution will help others 
Cool Idea 
Only fits your standard plugs room for improvements. 
Good basic covers 
Not bad but expensive 
love them agree need measuring cup 
Great concept 
Average nail clipper set 
It  works but there's have to be a better one out there!! 
Not Worth It 
Just okay... 
It's ok but may not be needed 
There Are Better There Are Worse 
Built to last but burns the milk! 
It's OK 
Quick and Easy but Pricey 
It's Not Exactly what I expected 
Leaves Wet Bottles 
Not great with other bottle brands... 
Serves the purpose 
Didn't fit my Pottery Barn Dresser with Changing Table Topper 
Nice to have 
Does the trick 
Not as sturdy as I had hoped. Ended up returning it. 
Decent but could be improved 
I thought this would be more useful than it really is 
Was cracked 
Its ok. 
Pretty decent 
It looks awful 
you may love it but its an inconvinience to me 
supports baby great but is Too Large a major inconvienence! 
I'll try it again when my baby is a bit older 
Not good for  young infants 
Has Good and Bad Traits 
Not good for small babies and bathrooms 
Just ok 
This thing is GIANT! 
Just wish it came with padding 
It's ok 
This bath is too big 
Not bad not great 
Semi stay on 
Does not stay stuck 
It doesn't fit 
Not very durable... 
Not the perfect pad 
get the colored ones 
Decent monitor for the price. 
OK as a backup monitor 
Good for what it is if you want something basic. 
Lots of unneeded feedback 
Good under the right circumstances 
Lots of static but it works. 
Not the Greatest 
Ok Quality matches its price 
Sounds Creepy 
Good for the Price 
Nice product but with some cons to pay attention. 
Nice glass bottle terrible nipple 
Does not include plastic storage discs 
Not the best for pumping 
Slower than Slow Flow but just right 
OK but not great 
These nipples worked great for a while 
Less Durable than Other Flow Sizes 
Too fast for my newborn 
Not so slow 
Flow was too fast for my newborn 
So So on the Flow 
Hands free but not as convenient as I thought 
Don't think the foot pedal is a must 
Decent for the price 
Kind of noisey. 
Worked great...  for 9 days 
Pretty Good 
Just Ok 
Good but too easy to shake open 
Love winnie the pooh pacifier clip is just ok! 
wouldn't do it again 
No toddler stool will fit everyone's needs perfectly... 
Works for toilet training but 
Not Tall Enough 
not tall enough 
Smaller Than Expected 
Skids a little bit 
Small and not tall enough 
They leak! 
Baby likes but mommy is disappointed... 
Very Versitile 
Works..sometimes 
Not What I Thought 
Still ended up bottlefeeding. 
Not for me 
OK 
Sizing is wrong 
Works great if the airlines let you use it 
Great idea & functionality but poor quality 
Overrated 
Not for everyday wear 
Meh 
Not a bad product but didn't use as often as expected. 
Works pretty well 
Didn't use 
These work ok but... 
Good but leaks sometimes 
Never Used. 
Easier height adjustment 
ok-depends on the time of the year your baby is born 
Not worth the money 
Pretty good 
They work but not my favorite 
Not so great 
Three Stars 
small 
Baby did not like them 
Baby takes them 
Picky Bottle 
Nice but not perfect for us 
Couldn't use with the nipple it came with 
Good for my older baby 
Air still comes in through nipple 
Decent product probably a little over-priced 
Nowhere near as good as the wide bottles 
Unfortunatelly they leak.. 
Just ok 
Save your money 
Not a great Nipple for my picky breastfed baby 
it`s ok 
Bottles are great.....Nipples not so great 
Great with Slow Flow but doesn't compensate fast enough for Medium or Fast 
nipples are the worst 
Basically does what it is supposed to do. 
Ehhh product 
Like it. 
Replacement valves 
Replacing valves is getting old 
I want to love this! 
Unecessary 
Returned it after I found out it takes 5 minutes to warm a bottle 
Great concept but it needs a little more tweaking! 
Good but you don't need the cooler 
heating times??? 
Not a necessary item but nice for some! 
I thought they looked great but my baby hated em. 
will try the standard playtex ventaire bottle. 
don't care 
these are ok 
Has problems 
Don't expect a miracle 
Too many pieces 
Fine I guess. 
Works but hard to see 
Good and practical. 
Does the job but needs help staying put! 
Beware of Cleaning!!!!! 
OK Product 
Okay price and design but works terrible 
Its perfect but did fall off in 3 days- but not a problem-still good product 
Stayed on for about a month 
Sticks way out and you constantly bump into it 
Of the few options this is the least bad 
Doesn't fit The First Years Breastflow Bottles 
One side fits Medela; Other does NOT fit Born Free 
It's okay. 
Leaks 
never ended up using.... 
Works ok if you can keep them from leaking. Also don't need both kinds. 
It is better than nothing 
Originally liked it but..... 
Get what you paid for 
Good 
Soso 
Looks good on paper 
Average Bottle Warmer 
Save your money 
It's handy but..... 
Ok for the money 
Be Careful 
Not helpful! 
You get what you pay for 
Not fast enough. 
Quick but hot 
Does the job mostly 
Better products out there 
Useful but one problem 
Good - but unpredictable 
Great product if you use it 
Okay product 
Good product idea not very accurate heating 
Works as expected but could be better! 
Well worth the Money but... 
bottle warmer is just OK. Tricky to figure out 
Works pretty good 
Helpful but be careful 
Warms well a little topsy-tervy 
Works well 
Good but too many parts. 
Buy one first to see if you like it. 
Dr. Brown's Was the Runner-Up in Bottle Choice 
I have recommended the bottles to several friends 
These are okay... 
Bought for cereal formula 
item as expected 
Not really a slow flow 
This are okay 
Great pacifier but too addictive 
Its alright 
It's a Baby Bottle Cap...What Do We Expect? 
like it 
OOPS 
So-so 
Does what it says but not very useful if you are frequently opening the door 
There are holes in these cups 
Not sure it made any difference 
Works well as a bath impossible to clean 
Mildew! 
Good Bather with a Few Drawbacks 
Nice but not very soft 
We stopped using this 
Baby Bath Pad 
Good enough 
Nice but don't see how you use it by itself 
Just \okay\ but not great 
An item I didn't end up using much 
decent- but did not find it as great as other reviewers 
We liked it okay 
Returned 
Hands-Free bathing!! 
Not what I expected 
Not preferred by my baby 
Plate okay spoons are great 
weird staining surface 
The spoons are great the plate does not stay put 
It does the job but nothing special 
Too light 
cute but pricey 
Awesome Mibile BUT... 
Great concept faulty execution 
Okay but not sure I'd buy again 
Good for SHORT TERM use only. 
It's not perfect but it works 
Great concept not practical 
Giving this a 3 
Only functional for a while 
My son loves this but was unable to use until about 6 m + 
Spill proof not leak proof. 
These are ok. 
On sale at Target 
Not at all durable 
for small babies only!! 
Not a quick project.... 
Difficult to work with 
Frustrating experience but finally got it to work. Some tips... 
NEEDS MORE ROOM FOR BOTTLES 
Not enough room for bottles 
Adequate for the price 
Adequate for the price 
Good Kit (relatively) - I recommend the 30 piece hospital kit instead. 
gets the job done 
Its okay 
These were 3 prong! 
Not as pictured but still great 
I recommend the 30 piece hospital kit instead. 
Only a couple of useful items - clippers are the best tho'! 
Ok but I would buy in store 
good idea but the avent sippy cups are not good 
True to description but still disappointed. 
Not for the newer glass bottles 
Look for CURRENT ratings - this is NOT the best of 2012 
Good product but expensive and not useful in the long run 
I disagree 
Stinks but nice looking 
Useful with Cloth Diapers But Wished It Held More 
Stinky Stinky Stinky 
Does Not Complete Odor Control. 
Too small for Cloth Diapers 
Doesn't Contain the Smell 
Diaper Dekor Plus 
Disappointed 
Easy but more stinky! 
Not quite as big as needed 
Fine until baby starts eating food... 
Our thoughts after 12 months 
not worth the money 
not so discreet afterall 
WAY too thick 
These work good. 
A little larger please! 
Better than some but not the best 
Not that great 
They do  the job but have some issues 
Work great - before they break 
VERY LOUD! 
Better products available 
big monitor black and white screen 
Start to leak over time 
I love Playtex sippys!!! 
Best Cups Hands Down Need gender selection option 
I like it but... 
I have a love/hate relationship with this Snoogle. 
It Was Only Okay 
Works ok case it comes with is not soft 
Better than no-preggo pillow but not for everyone 
It \was\ great... 
Sometimes Nice Sometimes Not 
Very happy to have it 
Can't say it was terrible 
Comfortable but Awkward 
Needs to have easier way to put on and off pillow case 
Solves some issues would love less loft for head. 
Great at first but neck pain soon followed. 
So many ways to perfect this product! 
Overall a good pregnancy pillow 
Itchy clothings and not soft at all 
Not high quality 
Wife didn't care for this pillow 
good idea for a pillow 
A mind of it's own 
Its alright 
It's OK.... 
Comfortable enough but large 
okay 
Way larger than expected 
Could be better quality and is cumbersome for some. 
Decent product...just not for me. 
Not enough back support 
Adds heat will not move with you 
Better for non-sleeping uses 
Just not for me 
Worked well for pregnancy 
Flattens quickly 
Wash wash wash before using 
They are ok 
They leak 
There's better ones out there. 
flat and not curved 
Comfortable but not invisible 
an ok product 
Absorbent but small 
Ok for around the house 
Meh 
bits of cotton sticks onto your nipples 
saves money but leaves funny lumps bc it's designed flat 
OK 
Not Discreet 
Ok but a bit pricey 
Meh...at least they weren't too expensive 
Not for cloth diapers 
Mostly useful 
OK but impractical for cloth diapers 
an O.K. pump 
Have to try it to see if it works for you! 
Good sound but also has a lot of static. 
Weird fit weird smell but usable 
Bulky and not soft 
Hook and Loop closure and patented flap drive me nuts. 
Not crazy about these 
Thinner than I was expecting 
It works. 
Thanks for a used product 
I really want to give this five stars but.... 
It's just OK 
Good for one baby not for twins 
MUNCHKIN is RIGHT! This tub is SMALL. 
Great idea doesn't work for us. 
Good but Doesn't Last Long 
Cute but small 
It's alright if baby's not too small 
Actual tub is smaller than it looks like 
good for older babies 
Another great product gone downhill. 
Good while it lasted 
Had for about a year and then it sprung a leak 
Fun and functional 
Waste of space 
Not the best pass this one over! 
May or may not work for you - have a back-up 
Great the first time around....not the second.... 
Oh boy do I HATE this pump 
Medela Harmony Lansinoh Avent Isis and Avent Comfort Compared 
If a hand pump is what you want this is pretty good. 
Big Boppy fan but................. 
Not really necessary... 
Baby loves it Mom hates it. 
Good Tub but has Two Major Imperfections 
Waste of Money! 
Great but what toddler fits in this? 
Limited Usage - OK product 
its okay but not the best 
Needs improvements 
love/hate relationship with this tub 
Slip Pads Are Falling Off 
Not that great 
OK bath tub 
Does not work for my baby 
Cheaper at walmart 
Good except for 2 things... 
There has to be a better way 
Not very pleased 
Contents do shift 
more convenient than the whole can but hard to spin the top around. 
Leaky. 
It's not Kiddopotamus but Summer Infant... 
Won't stay unrolled 
Great Concept 
Doesn't take super-human strength to dislodge 
Doesn't work everywhere but doable 
Food mill 
a little work 
KidCo food mill 
Food mill 
There just aren't very many options for locking sliding doors 
Bought & never used 
Warps and stains in dishwasher. 
Don't work as well with Avent Natural Bottles 
room for improvement 
Fun toys not as advertised 
ehhh 
A bit awkward 
Its not a Boppy but it will do 
The sage color is great but it sinks around your waist! 
Just okay for me 
Doesn't work very well as nursing pillow but not bad for a baby cuddler/couch 
On the fence. 
Meh 
Useful but not for nursing 
not bad 
The only bottle my son would take but ... 
Great bottle horrible stage 1 nipple 
Too much trouble 
Not for my newborn 
Just ok 
they are ok 
A lot of $$ for what you get 
Good Idea if your baby took to Swaddling 
Runs very large 
zipper trouble 
Works great no worries about blankets 
Great design but SUPER smelly on my son 
nice but zipper sometimes opens 
Nice but 
Just okay 
You better off buying the bare naked boppy 
Didn't like it 
Nice but not comfortable... 
Don't get them until you know you'll be leaking milk! 
Wicks moisture but doesn't stick worth a darn 
Not a bad pad but not the best either 
Great! While it lasted... 
Gets the job done for really soft foods. 
So-So 
great concept....an ok gadget 
Pretty good 
An Ok food mill 
Not so great 
ok but not great 
Nice but pricey 
Too stiff and smaller than it looks 
Good toy but not worth quite that much money 
Older bigger Boppy tummy play is better 
Waste of Money particularly if you have the Big Boppy 
Eh not excited about it 
Too thin no protection from spit -up & diaper leaks 
Warning: This product shrinks in the wash 
Not as good as we had expected or hoped... 
Good quality mirror but is a bit big & can obstruct view 
Great For Entertaining Baby But Bad For SUV's 
Not such a great buy 
OK but we're on our 4th one! 
2nd time I've gotten a defective mirror... 
great storage container good step stool so so tub side seat 
Don't Think it is a must! 
Okay but there are better... 
It's \OK\ 
Impossible to clean! 
For the Price OK but of Limited Usefulness w/ Torticollis 
Helps for some things but not others 
Too Hot 
It is sort of working for us... 
Make sure it's the right one 
BE CAREFUL!! 
Very tall and bulky- go with Graco Click-Connect instead... 
It's a must have but diffiuclt... 
Convenient but think before buying. 
YOU DON'T NEED THIS! 
Okay as a backup pump 
Its ok 
Perfectly Adequate 
Beautiful but not practical 
Cute but careful... 
Pockets aren't all they're cracked up to be 
frames are nice but... 
Average Car Seat At A High Price... 
We loved it - He hated it 
Not what I expected! 
Too small and synthetic material too HOT for baby! 
Let me clear some things up 
Look at something else 
Ok. 
Like it but i think its not approved for safety... 
Doesn't keep dirt off seats 
Nice and thick but not great for rear facing 
it's OK 
Keeps Slipping 
I like it but...... 
Tinny but fine 
It works 
Sound Sleeper 
Playtex can save you some money! 
Dr. Brown's are better 
Playtex works for us!  Look for set with more variety. 
Tolerable 
Very cute but shrinks! 
TOO BIG 
okay as expected 
Zippers 
Not for us 
Not worth it if baby stands up already 
I wish I'd bought the next size up 
Size is weird 
It's good if you need one. 
Disappointing 
replacement pillows are not worth the cost overall 
Catchy but not needed... 
Nice to have but not necessary 
I wish it made the wipes  more warmer 
Good idea but not all it's cracked up to be 
Sort of gimiky to me 
Indulgent yes... worthless no. 
Mostly use warm water instead 
Works well for non-pop up wipes 
IT'S A GREAT IDEA BUT DON'T GET FROM PRINCE LIONHEART 
Top does not close 
Could Be Improved... 
It's okay 
Doesn't get too warm 
Served it's purpose for about 2 months 
Never used 
harbors mold...sponge doesn't stay moist 
Worked Great for the First 2 Months... 
5 (sorry not 3) stars for something I never thought I'd end up buying 
A Necessity - But I wish there was a better one 
Music too loud 
Ok mat could be better 
Cute but not what I really needed 
NOT THE BEST 
Decent but there are better ones 
Good but not fabulous like I thought 
doesn't help a spitter 
Great for gas but other disappointments 
Mediocre in our experience. 
Great Product - If you like PINK :) 
New style cup is not as good as the old one 
Meh. 
works but has plasticky taste and gets moldy 
Inexpensive - Great Training Cups - Not Spill Proof - Name is Disappointing 
glad that we bought them for summer time and use ... 
before you buy an expensive pump get a $20 manual one first 
good basket; large holes 
Great Value... but itchy!!! 
No more 3 packs... 
Okay 
Not practical for rear facing 
Maybe it will work better for older babies?? 
multi-purpose or not? 
Better when faced forward 
Better when faced forward 
too big for younger babies 
Too awkward for babies 
Good but haven't used 
My daughter just didn't like it. 
teether 
Nicely made but kind of boring 
NOT GREAT NOT BAD 
Fun but.. 
ok teether 
Could be better 
Average teether/toy 
Great concept but... 
Pleasant the eye but hard to grip 
More fun for me than baby 
not the best 
Don't buy for the teether part 
Teether 
OK for the Price 
It was kind of big... 
just ok 
Plastic is pretty hard - not chewy 
More for 6 months and up... 
Warning:  This product shrinks when washed! 
Decent for the cost 
Good toy poor construction. 
ehh not so much 
Fun for a short time but cheaply made 
Doesn't Stick to some Tile 
Static issues 
Didn't like the light! 
Love the concept but don't like the mesh 
Good concept just know what you are getting 
OK but has some issues 
Really torn about this product 
Good idea but makes my son sweaty 
SAFETY CAUTION 
Tedious wrapping 
Not great for my newborn 
Bjorn and Maya Wrap still have more advantages... 
I returned this carrier... 
You gotta have patience 
It's ok- would try something else next time. 
interested to look at 
Really catches baby's attention 
baby enjoys mobile! 
Well I do like Wimmer-Ferguson but this wouldn't fit our crib.... 
Not motorized Only fits cribs with slats/spindles 
Ok Mobile 
visually stimulating 
Cheap materials but good idea 
Yes there are cracks 
Pretty good 
It's cute... 
simple but nice 
A Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Fail-Mobile 
Great patterns but poor execution 
Baby loves it I don't 
Baby became bored quickly 
Limited use difficult to attach works IF it fits 
Better than a High Chair 
It didn't work for my table 
Good seat. Some pros and cons though.. 
Good for what it is 
I'd find a different option. 
Big for my baby 
Easy to transport doesn't fit on all restaurant tables 
Good when it fits on a table 
clip broke after a week on the 1st one 
Good use hard to clean not washable. 
Great idea... but... 
Good for travel not for everyday use 
Ok but doesn't meet my needs 
Inconvenient 
Last Resort Chair 
You might want to know... 
not as pictured 
Not sure how others have hung this on their wall 
Alright I guess but too warm for our baby 
Don't waste your money on a 3 pack 
Not the best quality 
Works Great If You Know How to Use It 
Watch their heads! 
Great but hard to get in/out of 
I did read the instructions but the bottles still leaked... 
Ok to start but this is not all you need 
Not Preferred By Our Baby 
Bottles did not decrease colic in my child 
Decent Plastic Cups 
These didn't work well for my child 
No more spoons!

A bit too big 
Waste of extra money

Buzz 
Depends on where you live. . . 
Better for a big house

Some static 
Have to try it to see if it works for you! 
Ok Monitor

Stair Guard 
Not pretty but it serves its purpose 
Okay 
Not great looking...but is that why we are buying it?? 
Functionally fine but visually unappealing. 
Functions well but hard to install 
Bad batch of foggy mirrors -- but it can be remedied! 
not very pleased with this mirror 
Good but shifts 
I like the size of it. 
Needs improvement 
Didn't Use These - Flow is too fast 
Either slow or fast???/ 
Great for spare parts for Vintage Baby Bottle Collection

Not a bad toy 
Parts are more fun than the whole toy 
Nice toys

too small 
Great if your baby will sleep in it 
Great but Too short! 
Didn't really use it that much 
Great product but can be improved 
Good but very large 
Necessary Item? 
Need king size bed to use this

Good for Very Short Term Use 
I can make better ones myself 
Bunched up after washing 
A little fuzzy 
Not 100% pleased 
2.5 stars -- Not my favorite 
very thin 
Okay product 
Serging seems cheap 
Thin but do the job - good as \tissues\ 
Could be thicker 
They work 
Made in Pakistan! 
Super soft wipes! - Stitching falling apart after first wash : ( 
Feel nice at first but then get scratchy 
a bit on the wimpy side 
Loved them initially 
Didin't work for MY crib but might for other designs 
works well 
Gummi Crib Rail 
Extra Wide 
They work 
Great but needs adjusting 
it's ok 
Poor design 
Buy replacement mesh bags 
Where's the suction? 
Takes too long! 
updated 3/28/06 
Decent system 
good but NOT the air vent!!! 
Too hard to suck 
Wish the shield detached from the connector. 
IT'S ONLY ONE...if you need a pair of them order TWO 
Annoying but necessary

Lots of hype okay swing 
Nice swing but has issues 
The mobile broke 
Hinge broke shortly after purchase new hinges on way

A few flaws 
Just okay... 
Not bad

WOW. This thing is HUGE! 
Good for only one baby. 
So cute but flimsy 
Not Essential 
Many uses but don't wash well

Sturdy but not the most convenient 
Not good for little monkeys 
Good product with a couple of asterisks 
Flimsy but couldn't find anything better 
Does what it supposed to - mostly 
Works - but flimsy 
Does the job but it's bulky and kind of a pain 
Odd shaped.  Not sturdy.  Difficult to disconnect. 
Not as sturdy as the North States metal play yard 
eh 
Great but hard to set up 
It's okay 
Short window of usefulness - mixed feelings 
Good product but difficult for short parents 
will NOT make a real octagon 
Good idea in theory 
just buy two sets - 
broke 2 pieces 
When it works it's great 
It smells nice that's about it. 
Nice scent but not \natural\ as some describe 
Strong smelling 
just OK. 
Thought it would be better 
Not working good

easy to use but flawed idea 
I am looking forward to using these. 
Thick. 
Doesn't keep cold but good for transport to sitter 
Works but not perfectly.

not bad could be better! only one with 2 large compartments 
White Waffle and Pink Round Badger Bassinet 
very pretty but 
Does what it's supposed to 
They do the job but they're pricey!! 
Convenient but expensive

Too expensive

Paint scratches easily 
Not as pictured!!  Not Graco Brand 
not sure 
Didn't work very well 
Not a Germ-a-phob BUT please...carts are nasty 
Cute but not as safe as I would like it to be... 
Gets in the way 
It is SO loud! 
Better than the alternative...but... 
Seam comments are so true but the rest of the pillow is great 
Love it! 
Great purchase if your prepared to do some minor alterations 
Great at first but flattens over time 
Wonderful pillow! 
useful but with a few tips 
I loved it he hated it 
Not as comfortable as I had hoped

So small!!! 
Not spectacular 
Look cute but not very useful 
Looks Cool 
Okay gates 
Ugly cheap and functional... 
you get what you pay for... :/ 
Worked great....for a week 
It works ok 
Can't stop my little climber 
For the price... 
Hmmm...really think before you buy. 
Serves it purpose 
Not high quality but does the job 
the adhesive doesn't really work 
Tape doesn't stick to foam 
Buy your own aheasive 
Very soft 
The tape is not strong enogh they fall off! 
Nice but not necessary 
Does Not Work for Exceptionally Squirmy Baby 
GREAT for Short Term 
Good concept imperfect execution 
Nice blanket but... 
Great for small babies 
not for big babies 
The small size is to small 
Gives a good tight swaddle but outgrew blanket quickly. 
Okay but big for a newborn 
A step up frm a receiving blanket but out classed 
my baby was small 
Great when you can get it on right. 
it's ok 
Baby won't leave on 
Smaller than expected 
a little too hard 
Easy to clean but not the most comfortable for baby 
too small

run small 
Comparison to Oxo bib 
great but baby doesn't like it 
Didn't work well with Boon Chair and BLW 
Has good points but doesn't keep my baby clean 
Pretty Good 
Great concept but don't work with highchair for younger tots 
Pockets too high 
Too big for five month old 
Great item little Houdinis can still remove... 
Why is this called a \soft\ bib? 
Good bibs touch in high chair! 
Not ideal 
Not for Smart Babies 
Not as long as the dimensions state 
Just Okay We're not really blown away by it or anything! 
You can do much better for less money 
Something different 
eh 
Hit or miss 
Nice toy but the mirror fell off right after opening it 
My 1-2 year old son couldn't / didn't use it. 
Two pieces cannot be washed; three pieces bulky for small babies 
Good  product 
Just OK 
Just OK 
Not tall enough for a pillow top mattress 
great design and hold cheap material 
Measure your bed (top of boxspring to floor) 
Pretty but with unnecessary features... Needs thicker mattress!!!! 
Great Idea; Not-So-Great Design 
Wouldn't buy again 
Happy but don't use all bells & whistles 
this is nice but very bulky and takes up a lot of space. 
Like height but too wide and wheels don't roll 
Good bassinet but something needs noting 
Adhesive not so great 
Not my favorite 
Not So Good 
Bjorn and Maya Wrap still have their advantages 
Good for a short time 
Easy to Use 
Average 
Spend the extra $ and get a better playmat 
not great but kids will love... 
Decent given limited product options 
Serves its purpose some of the times. 
Good Choice for long term use. 
Great infant seat but not a great toddler seat 
Great for a Newborn 
My baby doesn't like it too much but its ok 
no battery for vibration piece 
Slightly underwhelming 
no warranty? 
Fischer Price Infant to Toddler Rocker 
It's okay 
Not Bad But Not great! 
Nice if only......... 
Despite all the positive reviews we were not impressed 
Good but has is quirks 
Toy Bar Needs Improvement 
cute but basic: a bit on the cheap side 
Like it don't love it 
Not the right fit 
Not safe for infants who are starting to sit up 
Not that great for an infant who wants to play 
Just Okay 
Good for the money 
Okay product; my daughter is not interested in it... 
Not that impressed 
Better for toddlers 
Just Ok 
Ehhh So So 
side shelves a bit flimsy and cushion is useless... 
Bought for the dream on me 3 inch mattress 
Product image does not match product delivered 
Smaller Than Expected but Still Acceptable 
I don't fully trust this 
cute until it came apart then a hazard 
decent product for the price 
Great features on this bouncer 
Nice bouncer but my child can't reach the toys! 
Great to watch for a newborn older kids might get frustrated 
Entertaining 
I Don't Feel This Is A Completely Safe Product 
Straps are TOO Short 
Functional but Not Durable 
Very Entertaining 
Entertaining for babies annoying sound for adults! 
Only So-So 
Some small adjustments would make it better 
Early in the game but ... 
works better when hardware mounted 
it is okay.... 
Leaves a lot to be desired... 
If you need something really supportive look elsewhere 
Not sure yet... 
small 
potty seat 
Just okay. 
It's a potty seat 
A little disappointed 
Works but can scare timid new trainers 
Great fit but not soft 
Tough and scratchy 
thin material 
Don't kill yourself climbing over it! 
Good for reflex - Bad for rolling....Sorta dangerous 
Helps with congestion 
Okay 
It's 2 peices 
Lacks a cover 
Don't love it ... 
Not big incline doesn't fit cradle. 
Works well but has a flaw 
Sound not the music can get irritating 
It works for me 
It's ok 
Not great but they stop the kids from touching the knobs 
Can you say big 
Annoying but keep little hands away from the controls. 
Might be great but check your knobs first! 
This is the only product I've found but it breaks easily. 
Toddler Deterant not Toddler Proof 
Just okay 
Worked great until broke 
Kinda big 
They break 
Small fry and I are unsure. 
Worked great until it broke our door. 
Great Mobile for Price but Music Sucks 
Not bad but for the price you can get something better 
it's okay 
Okay; design could be better and easier to use. 
Milk Mate Storage Containers Better 
Don't get it unless you're using the Avent bottles too 
nice to have it in the diaper bag 
Less fluffy than my old Dr. Brown's brushes. 
Doesn't last long 
Fit plastic and glass differently 
GREAT 
This review more for the bottles in general... 
Not THAT Bad 
Dries the wipes out 
Warm but dries out wipes 
Did Not Help Reduce Spit-Up 
OK for the value 
not what i expected 
Great bottle but HATE the lids! 
Happy with product not color 
Good idea in theory 
I'm going to stick with my non-liner bottles. 
Great for on the go (when washing isnt an option) 
Good Bottle but not great! 
Great design but Amazon sent me three year old bottles. 
Useless measuring 
Good bottle for travel 
Just OK 
Sticking with Playtex non-drop ins ! 
Nice...but one problem 
Good bottles but not very convenient 
Nipple is too slippery when milk gets on the outside 
Extra Parts Extra Work No Benefit 
More to deal with than I like. 
Good but hard to clean and not so durable 
Ugh! The Parts! 
No leaks and lots of options. 
Decent But Not the Best 
Ughhh The leakk! Help 
Works OK 
Pretty good but not the best going. 
drop ins better 
What a hassle to clean 
VentAire standard are preferred by my baby.. 
Like the bottles HATE the nipples 
a few flaws 
It's nice could be better 
Sitting on the Fence 
Good baby swing but too fast for small infants! 
you pay for bells and whistles 
pretty good swing but with some negatives 
A few drawbacks... 
To Fast To Bulky To Loud 
Mixed feelings about this seat 
Good for minor use 
Love and Hate it at the same time 
Easy to use but not comfortable with position 
alright i guess 
Not as powerful as similar priced manual pump 
Great when it works. 
Good but not great 
good- not GREAT 
If you pump more than 2-3x per week get the Swing! 
ok product 
ehh 
Not as good as I'd hoped 
rent from the hospital first 
Maybe it will work... 
Fine for a manual pump I guess? 
Great While it Lasted 
Cheap pump 
Easy to use but hurts! 
electric pumps are better 
Disappointed at the product 
Great Pump But.... That darn o-ring 
Lost Suction Fast! 
Meeh. 
Don't buy unless you're handy! 
Ideal price cheap made 
Cute but hard to assemble 
Okay but issues 
Very difficult to assemble 
Looks nice but missing pieces 
cosmetic damage and questionable hardware 
Cute 
UPDATED REVIEW 
Usable but not entirely user-friendly. 
Good but I've had better! 
They look funny but do the job 
Cool looking but flimsy 
I always get the crappy red one 
It works 
Works But \Eh\ 
OKay 
not sure how much it will hold? 
Good enough 
Huge Hooks - Used Command Strips Instead 
Eh. It's just ok 
Bath Toy Hammock Havoc 
Baby loves it but doesn't clean so well 
Go for the shade 
Not bad 
Okay  toy 
not the best but it works 
Not very universal. 
I saved my kid from falling in the toliet with this 
Good butt... 
What a  pity!!! 
Overall a decent purchase 
Good product but ripped 
changing pad cover 
not needed 
good quality 
Soft but thin 
The color is a brighter green than in the picture 
Ok but you can get better at Target 
Nice for a newborn. 
Soft but not durable 
Nice and soft 
Good product not great color 
Does the job but a bit overpriced. 
Right one 
It Works 
Raises to the right height but not very stable 
Higher but not so sturdy 
Shaky addition and not worth the $ 
Perfect height 
Ok 
They will work 
It was ok 
Somewhat diasappointed 
Good but overpriced 
Good product but would probably buy larger containers. 
Lids are not tight - not dishwasher safe 
Yep - their Ice cube trays... 
Well made however difficult to get the cubes out of compared to regular ice cube trays. 
Good idea but a little bit of a hassle 
Better than an ice cube tray! 
Great and easy to use 
Eh not impressed 
did i pay for an ice tray with lids? 
They do their job. 
Great idea just a little hard to get the milk out of the tray 
Like it but... 
Just okay. 
maybe fine for baby food but not good for breastmilk 
Not the bet 
the case freezes too! 
Hard to get out 
Lids will not fit 
Expensive ice cube trays 
Does the job nothing special. 
Don't forget 
Needs modifications 
Good idea with a few flaws 
Very difficult to attach to Combi Twin Sport Stroller! 
Good shade clumsy attachment 
not a very bad buy 
It is okay. 
I just hope it looks better after the first year 
Now what am I going to do with it? 
Good for car trips 
Would Have to Pass 
Great for carrying the car seat 
Wish the stroller was a little more shock absorbent 
Use it all the time but wish I had bought a different one! 
Good for traveling 
Not bad but there is a better option... 
Good for the price 
Looks nice with the rest of the set but a lot of $ for such a basic design 
Took a few tries but now is keeping time 
NO. Wish I would have known. 
Our second summer monitor. 
Good monitor 
If You Don't Mind Static and Peeping Toms It's Cool. 
Won't buy again for second baby 
Ask your neighbors which monitor they have first... 
Decent monitor which saved my sanity the 1st year! 
Good product needs more features 
Static is a problem 
Tons of static and analog is not private 
not sure about it yet 
Still Stinks 
Super strong scent 
Smell is a little intense 
Way too small 
not so good product...good seller 
Doesn't contain serious stink 
Regular polythene with added fragrance 
SMALL 
Strong scent 
good for home 
Poor Material 
For Newborns ONLY and very thin 
Simple to use but maybe too simple for effective swaddling 
Just OK - motor is loud and it doesn't stay on long enough 
Fun but loud 
It's grown on me 
After FIVE years of use... 
Great chair 
This seems like a decent cover with some small issues. 
fraudulent image 
Doesn't stay put very well 
not for intended use 
okay 
Does the job 
Good for catching milk but wears easily in the wash 
Great bibs but 1/3 the price at TRU 
Good bib velcro sucks! 
The directions say you have to caulk this elephant on ... 
Cute 
Sturdy and cute but modifications may be needed 
cute idea it didn't fit our tub 
Meh 
Cute/Doesn't fit 
Super cute when it stays on the faucet. 
Elephant spout 
Three Stars

Serve purpose put easy to take out 
I'd prefer it was opaque.

Decent for the price 
Alright 
They work!! Maybe too good 
Frosted plastic kind of cheap looking. 
good 
Very hard to get out from outlets 
Works well 
Does it's job not easy to install 
Hard to keep things plugged in 
Meh 
Smaller than most covers 
Babyproofed the house....and also parentproofed it. 
Screw hole is in the center 
It's okay 
Very Small 
Average 
Car shade only ok 
Basic shade easy to install 
Good idea but far from perfect 
Okay 
keeps seats cleaner 
Airy great for boat and small areas very short \leash\ line. Good color 
good 
Good idea but not the product 
Annoyed by the packaging 
Needs higher splash guard 
Not necessarily the best for a boy 
Too small for big kids & moves 
bit small but comfy 
Great! 
Ok product 
Lid doesn't open very far 
Okay for the job but foot pedal is the issue here 
It's an OK diaper Pail 
Do Not Buy If You Have A Dog 
doesnt fully open 
Not the best 
No smell from it 
Decent cheap pail 
Not good for wood floors or normal sized feet 
Meh. 
Smaller than expected 
small okay diaper pail 
Okay 
Nice but small 
Stylish but not as durable as we had expected 
Son loves it 
Cute but gets jammed 
Was great until... 
The breastsheilds are attached! 
As expected 
I love them baby doesn't! 
Good reusable cover 
Nice for the price.. spring for the Thirsties. 
ehh ok 
Not my favorites 
Maybe For younger babies? 
didn't help my son's eczema 
papery not the best. 
works but not soft 
They sent me the LARGE toddler liners not the BABY liners in the description! 
They work but are scratchy and I can't flush them. 
Used to be better 
It worked but we no longer use it. 
Do the job but don't seem comfy on the tushy 
Sometimes Smells 
Used to really like this stroller 
Ok for baby bottles only 
soft 
Looks better than it actually is 
This brush is just ok 
Dirty nipples... 
good idea but not what i was going for 
Ok 
Not as sturdy 
These work and are great - the sticker left behind is permanent 
they work great until.... 
Tricky to Use but effective 
works well enough 
Works well but doesn't last 
Screws broke off in cabinet 
Easy to install but didn't last long 
great idea but hard to clean! 
Difficult to open 
Fresh food feeder Eh ~ so so 
Hard to get the lid off 
Great for on-the-go formula 
Good for travelling but.... 
Lid won't stay closed - cracked container 
Too many pieces. Not a soft mouth piece. Might be spill proof but not worth the trouble 
ok cup 
Need color choices 
Baby isn't quite ready for these... 
They're just okay... 
These are okay 
Pretty Basic 
meh. 
Really hard to get liquid out but I guess they don't leak... 
Hard to drink out of 
not spill proof 
leaky 
At least they don't leak... 
Great Product  - but colors vary 
Perfectly decent sippy cup 
Not impressed but it works okay 
pleasant cleanser; poor brush 
Fine toothpast toothbrush needs work 
Not my favorite toothbrush but is ok 
Just Another Toothpaste 
Too fast for my little one 
Nice bottle nipple but very leaky 
Doesn't fit well on all toilets 
Does the job for the price 
super cute but your taking a chance on colors .. 
Waste of Money 
Snack Trap? 
Cute but not functional after a few uses 
great idea and design but less than it used to be 
Buy Snack Catchers instead! 
Terrible on the back but baby loves facing out 
Good for small baby but then hurts shoulders a lot. 
A Mixed Bag 
Better than \Original\ but not by much... 
hurts my back 
It's a good carrier but it kills my back! 
Great product but faded too quickly 
Great...if you have a strong core 
Poor weight distribution 
Won't be using a Bjorn again 
Works well -- kid can get hot 
could only hold our daughter for a very short period of her development 
Baby Bjorn (mama here) 
Not good for babies over 15 lbs and/or 26 inches 
Have a love/hate with this 
Hurts husband's back after awhile 
easy to use but poor support for mom's back and baby's hips 
Not in love 
Easiest carrier to put on and to get baby into but the least comfortable 
If You're Large-Chested Find Something Else 
Kills your back 
alternative to baby bjorn 
It Works 
Don't buy it until/unless you really need it... 
helpful but gets uncomfortable 
Quick and easy to use but kills your back! 
Did not securely fit into gate 
Not as soft as says 
A little rough 
Video Review 
Runs small but good quality and effective.. IF your baby is still tiny. 
LO didn't like it. 
great product but easier for baby to \break out\ 
Came loose 
Not as good as Halo 
Disappointed in the Velcro 
Ok Swaddler 
Large size seems hazardous for strong boy with will to turn over 
Good product but probably won't use large size 
Not the same as the infant 
Does not work with Chicco car seat 
Much thinner than I expected 
does the trick but not a great fit for the snugride 35 
Serves the purpose 
JJ Cole Urban Bundleme Stealth 
good but too small 
Blanket is great but I had to air it out for days 
description is wrong 
Good bottle bag 
Bottles don't fit nicely with tops 
Could be bigger 
Just ok 
Bigger than I thought 
I love these cups but....... 
good but not the best 
Cute but not the best. 
The sling + bump don't work together 
Okay 
Nice tub for newborns 
Works great but... 
Great for newborns not so great for the in-between stage! 
Seems a bit small... 
Loved the sling hated the tub. 
Good for newborns 
Useful for small baby but risky to use. 
An ok tub 
Hard to clean 
eh. 
Nice but not big enough 
Difficult to install 
too fast for \slow flow\ 
Flow not consistent 
Not as good as the clear \slow\ ones. 
work well but smell terrible. 
Does what it is supposed to do. Changed milk. 
Work Okay 
Harder to thaw than bags 
Not for giant toddlers/preschoolers with tantrums 
LOVE the stroller but it is very large. 
Wanted to love it 
Loved for a little bit... now unwieldily... 
Best of an ok bunch....? 
Good for the price 
Good for the Price

Crib sheet for graco three stage travel lite crib 
Not very soft 
Just ok

Great but...... 
Great 
Better for older babies 
I should have just used what I had 
Just okay 
Good for baby food but a little quirky! 
Not as good as they used to be 
Not what I ordered 
You get what you pay for 
I cut a hole out of the side 
OK As a Pet Barrier 
Nice but don't wear well 
Not amazing but still convenient 
great chair though weight limit more like 28lbs 
Should have listened 
works great with one major flaw... 
Good price for this product 
didn't fit my pump 
Product quality and value as expected but size options did not work for me. 
Not significantly different from 24mm 
Large size helped 
hole not small enough shield too small 
Medela Small Breastshields 
ok 
Can't tell the difference 
Not what I was  expecting 
These work well 
Channel is wider but legnth is longer 
These are okay

Questionabe 
The product is as promised but I don't find it useful. 
Great idea 
the wipes are individually packed! 
Baby got bored with it 
Great concept but super wobbling for our elongated toliet 
Sounds like a great idea but a bit instable for a beginner 
For your smaller child 
2 different reviews you need to see. 
Good for a year then unrecoverable 
Didn't stick to our \slick\ bath tiles 
Great until it falls off the wall 
Very cute functional when it stays up

Cute but not worth the price. 
Just okay 
Good as a Back-Up

Entertaining but depends on the purpose. 
pretty but not much of a night light. 
I like it and I don't. . . . 
Very cool but a bit expensive 
It's Okay...Wasn't what I expected 
Interesting product good when all the lights are off. Some kids might not like it.

Comfy but...

toliet cover 
It seemed like a good idea... 
Kids will fall in...be careful 
Bulky but sturdy 
Nice soft seat but slides around a bit. 
Works well....sometimes. 
Love how it folds No peepee guard not very stable 
So far so good.. I suppose. 
If you want a rear-facing seat for a long time go with the Marathon

Seat is made for sitting not walking. 
Quality ok but not great 
Typical disposable furniture 
Not as good as the Stork Craft Crib 
Not great quality but okay for price 
hard to assemble drawers don't line up 
Not bad 
Okay for the money but had to exchange a drawer. 
So-so Product 
Work fine but these are way to big for the Babino Mio bucket 
Does the job 
it was ok 
So messy and really not great for hands 
It may be me 
This was not as simple and easy as the kit would have you believe...although not all of that has to do with the kit itself 
Just OK 
not so sure 
Not practical 
Meh. 
more aesthetic than anything else 
Baby enjoys it but Mama sees room for improvement 
Kept collapsing 
Could be better if there was something that moved 
Tad overpriced for what you get. 
Sometimes it tips over! 
Very nice but overwhelming. 
Sound wiring is defective 
OK but not great 
There are better playmats out there. 
Is this real or fake 
Not essential

Beware of getting a set with music function that just dont work! 
I guess I'm happy if he's happy. 
Not that great

Amount differs from description 
Great deal overall but cups are not safe for biters 
Three Stars 
Thought they would be better than they actually were 
It's only ok 
Not easy to use 
Be careful. 
save your $ and use a qtip 
nothing special 
Okay Clipper for Toddler 
Sharp blade but a bit small to hold 
Its a hard plastic 
Its ok 
Not impressed

You'll likely not use everything in it... 
Effective but can get moldy

cute and easy to wash 
HARD TO ASSEMBLE 
scratches easily 
SOOOO Hard to put together! 
Nice but oh the SCRATCHES (and poor customer service from manufacturer)

OK But Edgy 
Very big- but my sons feet go in and out- not so great. 
No miracle sadly 
Don't know! 
Not easy to use 
Not worth the $$$ 
Works but a little complicated 
Not a miracle for us. 
Superior to other swaddling devices inferior to the double swaddle 
Nice but doesn't last long 
It's ok. 
Pull it tight 
We did not like the design of this for our baby 
Frustrating to use if you have a wiggly baby 
Hard for me to use it 
Good for a newborn not as good after a few months 
May work great for some 
Great now bad later! 
I'm sure it works for some; but not me. 
Works Okay 
Didn't work for my 2 month old who doesn't like to be swaddled...plus a bit overpriced. 
Too much fabric 
Great but he could wiggle out of it 
No Go 
Good... if you need it. 
Does the job 
Could use some improvements 
Works half the time 
My baby was too big already...

Needs to be longer 
Didn't work for my kid 
Eh.  Just ok. 
Failed to see the miracle 
its ok but not for cold places 
not as soft as I hoped for 
Bigger that I though 
Not a replacement for Lenny the lovey 
Why don't you like this baby!? 
Not her favorite but it is soft. 
baby is not interested 
Mom love Dad not so much... 
I like it baby doesn't 
Do the research first! 
Okay but definitely not great. 
okay for girls but worthless for boys.. 
okay 
Nice tub but thermometer broke early on. 
Useless until I figured it out 
Decent Gate ok quality

Get the right cover! 
It will work 
Poor quality 
Ok 
Only Partially Successful.

OK 
not that good for puree 
Ok baby food grinder 
Great but i ended up not useing it much 
Okay for some foods 
Lids come off a little too easily

Good when they understand. 
eh. could be better. 
Good idea could be better 
Just okay 
Ok munchkin monster is better 
Neat idea but still doesnt work great 
decent but not for me 
Great concept... 
Not as good as I hoped 
It's okay. 
good 
Good handles lousy lid. 
Flimsy

Good idea. Kid figured out a way to spill it all 
spend the money! 
Not quite what I expected 
Nice Idea 
Nice one 
Doesn't really keep them in 
Love the product - needs improvements 
Might lose more food than you get.. 
Great if your baby is ready for it 
Clever Idea But Still Makes a Mess 
Good could be better (with accessories) 
Not spill-proof but the handles are great 
Maybe a catcher but not a keeper 
Good idea hard to get snacks out 
no real way to contain the mess this helps 
okay 
Our boy rips it open with his teeth -- not really useful 
Love the colors 
Upside down turtles? 
Cute but not worth it 
Water Traps 
I liked it 
crib light 
Munchkin Voice Activated Crib Light 
It's alright 
Munchkin products overpriced on Amazon

Great organizer 
Definitely a space saver but definitely has drawbacks 
A little disappointed

organizer 
OK but not very sturdy 
Cheap but functional 
Soapy water gets caught trapped in weird plastic \pockets\ 
I don't hate it but I don't love it either

oily initially. and a bit slow 
It's ok 
I love this type of bottle but I prefer the larger nipple 
ok 
Different from description 
Spill proof cup 
spill proof drinking proof 
Price 
Nasty toothpaste 
Works ok 
Granted I don't want my 1 year old in the toilet but I would like it if my adult friends could figure it out 
Great idea - but confusing 
Ok product 
Ehh 
Good for toddler 
Works better for some toilets than others 
Does the trick 
They're doing what they need to do. 
Works a little too well 
great helper 
Okay solution 
works for now... 
Still leaves some room to open. 
A little awkward. 
Better than nothing for now 
Put a trash bag in the refill carton 
Average. 
DIsappointing 
Major pros & major cons 
still smell small odor 
We have a love/hate relationship 
broke after 6 months 
great idea and works for awhile 
Pain to install but they do the job. 
Broke within days...probably good for under 12-14 month olds 
Difficult to install 
Child proof...and maybe adult proof. 
Worked for about a week 
It's been doing it's job for 3 months now 
Works well but too easy to break 
Not easy to assemble but very cute 
LOVE & Hate!

Hard as a rock 
Gift when I purchased a davinci crib. 
Looks nice but is made of cheap materials 
incomplete product 
a little small 
Overpriced 
Works as advertised just not helpful for me 
Not Bad 
Great ... For about a month 
This is a great swaddling blanket but.... 
Good gate but... 
Not sire how duable this is 
okay but need another product to hold on 
Not the full coverage we needed 
Stick with regular Bumkins bibs 
Good for younger babies 
I don't see they are helpful... 
Great idea but bad quality velcro. 
Pockets work but could be longer 
Like them but .... 
Not my favorite 
They do the job but aren't worth the price. 
Good for feeding - NOT for drooling! 
Waterproof bibs 
I prefer Baby Bjorn 
really thin 
Cute but not meant for skinny babies 
Not for young infants 
Very thin but cute design! 
didn't work out as well as I had hoped 
Good for traveling; retains some odor 
Do the job but the best 
3rd or 4th set because it gets stinky 
Great until it was smelly... 
Not for babies who love to explore 
I really wanted to love these but they didn't stay on 
Cute but unsure about safety 
Cute but not a winner in my house. 
I was rather excited for my baby to use these ... 
Great concept hard to clean

Child: loves Mom: not so much! 
Okay 
Hard to Clean 
Your baby may love it or may not be interested 
Love the concept tricky to clean 
Hard to Clean 
Great (in theory) : But Didn't Use Much 
Wasn't worth the purchase 
Probably best for brand new tasters 
On the fence about this... 
love it but HARD to open 
Good in theory 
hard to clean 
Decent concept 
Entertaining but not safe 
Not Effective 
He likes it!..but is it doing anything? 
not bad 
Baby loves to chew on it but I wish the handle were much larger 
This thing seems more like a teether than toothbrush 
Good chew toy but not toothbrush. 
Great Soothing Teether as well 
Pretty Good Okay. 
Baby kind of likes it not sure if it cleans teeth. 
More of a teether than a toothbrush 
7-month-old likes it 
Could be dangerous 
little awkward to use 
Too soft 
too big and awkward 
The travel one is better 
I guess I'm alone in thinking this but... 
It's okay but not as nice as I hoped. 
Not sure if the baby likes it but I do! 
Sound box doesn't fit--which ripped it 
Not that great but does function 
only 4 sounds 
its ok 
Great product except for major design flaw 
cloud b sleep sheep 
Just buy a white noise machine 
wanted to love it wish it stayed on 
falling apart after &lt; 6 months 
It's okay... but I wish it didn't shut off automatically 
Needs continuous play mode sheep muffles sound 
Good idea better options out there 
I really wanted to love this. 
Too quiet 
Cute not so practical 
Doesn't seem to make a huge difference 
Not what I expected. 
Replaced with continuous play machine 
Cloud B Sleep Sheep 
Cute stuffed animal but not the best sound machine 
Okay but not great 
Limited to 45 minutes - useless for night time 
Cute but it's usefulness is limited. 
My baby doesn't care 
Great noise poor quaity 
Didn't Fool My Baby 
Ok product 
For my wife 
Its okay 
Clingy - not worth it. 
Good but expensive product 
Bebe au Lait 
Warm 
shrunk half its size! 
Not for everyone... 
didn't really work for me although I still recommend it 
Perfect for small infants but not older babies 
Not worth the $.  Might buy a cheap eBay China one and add wire to the top if needed. 
Not as good as I though it would be 
Nice one 
peekaboo !!!! 
Great idea but tough to use with an active baby! 
Doesn't Impress Me 
Not worth the money 
Too warm 
Good quality but thick cover has its down sides 
Not as useful as I thought it would be 
Pretty But... 
Pretty But Can't Quite Get it to Work 
Waaay too big 
Bibs 
Too big for baby! 
Utilitarian but not strong 
OK 
Great toy not so great thermometer. 
Just a toy 
Cute stay-clean little duckie - useless as a temperature checker 
As ducks go it's great. 
Cute Duck Poor Thermometer 
Its fine for the price. 
Eh it's ok 
Cute but Hard to Read 
Packaging 
Average 
its ok 
Bad thermometer 
Cute Toy 
It's cute but not an accurate gauge of water temperature 
Purchased for 10 month old 
It's a nice seat for skinny babies! 
Just ok 
Not in love with this... 
Not for chubby babies 
Hate the buckle!  Squeezes too tight! 
decent seat 
Daughters legs too chunky 
Useless really... 
It's just OK 
Loved it for when he needed a bit of help sitting up but that was only about 2 months worth of use 
Legs holes pretty tight 
Not sure the point 
Sheets are Rough - Love the fitted top sheet 
Form over function 
Used as a foot board. 
Good protection but it does not hide away in any way 
Don't buy unless you have box spring! 
Compared to the competition this is better BUT.... 
Doesn't work without a box spring 
good one but not the best design. 
Great while they last... 
Didn't last two months of occasional use. 
Good but not great 
A little flimsy 
Not very sturdy 
Not so sure it's worth it 
Nice cot but not perfect 
Doesn't fit most cribs 
window wedge 
hard bottom 
difficult to operate 
Roomy and functional but slow to set up and break down 
sometimes it seems locked but it's not 
Caution if you have casings around your doors 
Worked for our garage door but not the front door 
NO matter how I install it the self close mechanism is finicky. 
Good compared to some but not the best 
Overall would not recommend 
Useable but Chilly 
Good but not Great 
Bath Sponge 
Meh it's ok. 
Works okay 
doe not fit UppaBaby vista 
I wanted to like it more than I did 
There are better covers out there... 
Not the best nursing cover 
Kind of harsh 
Not that useful as I though 
Did not like the quality 
Child loves it but it's very poorly constructed 
Cute but not well made 
Came up short 
but the straight spout leaks terribly the minute it tips over 
Nice cups but some of the lids split easily 
Very comfy and acts as a head support in the carseat.... 
A bit bulky... 
meh 
Nice Idea But... 
Didn't help much 
okey no wonder 
In between 
It's Not Awful It's Not Great...It's Okay 
Good quality but won't fit well on a shallow tub 
Comfortable on knees but suction cups tore right off. 
Like the product but it didn't fit! 
its okay... 
So-so 
Needs some tweaking 
To slow 
Meh.. 
good for peace of mind 
Loved this at first! 
Grear for a while... 
Never used it to be fair 
Nice idea but... 
Gets the Job Done 
Awesome while it works... 
It's cute and does the job...could be better.

Functional... 
Double sided bed rail. 
Hard to assemble 
ADEQUATE WITH A FEW CAVEATS 
its okay. 
Sturdy but cumbersome 
does the job 
could be better designed 
Just okay 
Could have been better 
Took up a lot of counter space 
Eh... kinda pointless 
It works... 
Some design flaws but still a decent rack... 
Decent for an outlet cover but not for shortening cords 
Work with a short cord only 
Okay but doesn't work with all plugs 
Unable to use with the electrical receptacals in our home 
Check your cord sizes 
Great idea but 
Cord Holes too Small but otherwise good product 
Good idea but a pain to \disassemble\ 
Not a convertible mini! 
Helpful for the first few months 
NOT great for women who've had a C-section 
Velcro can be annoying 
good concept 
Not ideal but works. 
Expensive for what it is. 
CUTE NOT PRACTICAL... 
Color Lighter 
Not Soft Enough 
Be careful of color choices 
Ok but not for me. 
Cumbersome but works. 
Didn't get much use out of it but not because of the product itself 
Better than original Boppy not as good as new Boppy 
Not as great as I hoped for 
No friend of mine:  not easy to use 
Wait until after the baby is born 
Just \meh\... There are better toys out there 
It is a little to firm... 
Great design--poorly made 
Useful first few weeks for first time mom 
Not good post- Csection but useful later for daytime nursing 
Bulky 
Looks good but not super functional 
Aesthetics vs. Practicality 
Doesn't last all day 
Three Stars 
Cute but cannot be properly washed 
Nice idea but not very practical 
Mixed feelings

Has all the right features for a first toy...

He's just not into them 
DIdn't take to these 
Meh - it wasn't as fun as I thought it would be 
Not so impressed. 
Cute but wish they rattled louder 
Too quiet! 
Just OK 
Hard to Use as Intended 
Wrist rattles are nice socks come right off 
Cute 
Not a fascination for every baby 
Doesn't hold baby's interest 
OK- won't last 
Overwhelming 
Great if your kid likes it! 
my son is not a big fan 
It's ok 
it's OK 
okay--but she liked the bird version more 
love freddie! 
Not so great 
mom of 5 month old 
Fifi the Firefly - cost more than Freddie 
Freddie the Firefly vs. Tucker the Turtle for a newborn

Is fairly ok 
Works well to put baby to sleep 
I'm sorry but this thing is LOUD 
My baby didnt like it 
Low quality but works wonders 
It's just OK 
Cute but not for the money 
A life-saver but quality disappoints. 
Full Featured Swing and She's Still Not Happy! 
Love that it's not too big! 
Works ok I guess 
Nice swing 
5 stars for comfort and functionality 1 star maybe for durability 
I really wanted to love this swing... 
Motor sounds like a loud croaking frog--updated x2 
Works okay but not impressed for the price. 
Weak Motor - same as one found in airwick air freshener 
So-So 
Not for a Small House 
Cute but gets old fast 
Kind of boring 
Eh 
Nice but.... 
Good for resting/napping but otherwise... 
I would've gotten something else 
Great for newborns but didn't help our 2 month old... 
Okay get what you pay for 
Good placemat wish it stuck to the stable better 
Works but Sort of Ugly 
2 packs = 4 sheets 
Work for the snuggle nest but could be softer 
Didn't do much but still well made. 
Disappointed that it does nothing for my baby.... 
Smells good wasn't the miracle product we were hoping for 
It didn't work 
Not for my son 
Might work for colic but doesn't seem to help gas pains 
Didn't do much for my baby

Not my fave 
Cute...sounds like dog toy 
Don't get the hype

He doesn't seem to care about her much. 
Sophie the Homicidal Girafe 
Squeaker got dislodged

Not worth the money 
It's okay 
Okay but not worth the price 
Cute Rubber Giraffe Teether

My daughter didn't care for it 
Okay but not what I expected. 
Overpriced for a chew toy 
Super cute but baby could have cared less about Sophie 
Great for little hands tastes rubbery 
Squeaks 
Not for me 
Not sure its worth the money

Teether is great if your Little One will use it. 
Not the greatest... 
OK 
My baby didn't love it but I'll try it with my newest 
ok teether not worth the money though

My son wasn't interested

Only so-so 
Maybe it's best for younger babies... I was impressed but my son... not so much... 
Good phthalate BPA-free teething option for Baby #1 but not Baby #2.

Definitely not one size 
Love this diaper! 
its alright 
For Younger Babies 0-6 months

Pricey but worth it 
Life Saver

Not loud enough 
Very cute but wish it lasted longer. 
Cute but wish it ran longer 
Love it but it broke 
Not a magic elixer but still a good product 
Son loves it but it broke after 3 months 
For $5 more get the larger Cloud b Sheep! 
It would be nice if the sounds at least faded out at the end of the timer... 
Nice addition to the bedtime routine 
Would reccomend 
It's just okay 
Eh..it's ok.

no major problems here 
Practical but unsturdy 
baby care cart 
Too many pieces to assemble 
Just okay 
You win some...You lose some

Not Bad... 
The potty is clearly haunted 
Cute for beginners but not for taller toddlers 
Prefer older version 
Average looking 
Children... adults

Decent baby locks for a decent price but has minor issues 
Inconsistent results 
Ok trainer cup 
An OK drawer lock but leaves your drawer opened a few inches

You cannot microwave these containers 
They are OK 
Suction didn't work at first 
Decent enough I suppose

Good colors and build bad construction and not microwave safe 
Only works on certain surfaces 
Satisfaction depends on your expectations... 
3 bowls 1 lid

Very big for little mouths! 
We'll See 
Be warned... 
Not the best teether 
Not as great as I thought it would be... 
Too big 
(UPDATED Dec 2012) Good idea tempered by 1) need to replace after 1-2 months and 2) large size for 3-month-old 
Just ok for us 
Too big for babies with smaller mouths 
Baby not sold 
Cool design 
A little big for a small mouth

Not bad--but may not work when I switch to bigger/heavier bottles 
Not nearly as nifty as it looks in the photo 
Just ok 
It's a Rack!

First impressions. 
Faded Drastically after 1 wash. 
Not great for breastfeeding good for other things

Not so great for parents. 
best I've found so far

Gets dented easily 
These spoons melt 
Started fraying plastic after a month... 
It's a spoon

A little large for a infant 
Fine spoons 
Probably better for older babies.

Soft tip? 
Pretty colors but not as flexible as others 
a bit to large for my 6 month old 
Was going to give 5 stars... 
spoons 
handle heavy....food overboard 
Not well-balanced 
Ok spoons 
nothing too special 
good spoons w manageable defects

Only helpful until baby could feed himself 
It's ok. 
They were just \okay\ for me... 
Constantly flipping out of bowls 
Three Stars 
Great value but not our favorite 
Probably a better option for a toddler.  Not a good first spoon

Just ok! 
It's okay

The bright side was it worked as a good barrier from my husband lol 
Like sleeping on a cloud but does nothing for hip pain 
it's  ok 
The filling doesn't hold up 
Comfy but hot! 
It's OK 
OK not the best newborn toy 
Toy is not fun

Too Hard 
Too big as a teether 
Works ok 
Great if you baby likes swings! 
More economically priced baby swing than most 
Somewhat dissapointed... 
Great organization piece that could be toted around the house but flimsy 
It's just a bottle 
Is ok for younger children 
High quality and safe but some issues 
Really nice but... 
Buy the Britax 
Good car-seat but toxic smell. 
Attractive car seat but baby doesn't like it

It's ok 
TEST YOURS FIRST!!! 
It does what it says it does. 
Helpful but there's an app for that! 
Not really necessary and didn't find it helpful 
Great for those first few weeks at home with a new baby but useless after that 
Never Used but Good Idea

Nothing a cell phone app or a white marker board couldn't handle 
Mixed feelings

They are just OK 
Poor adhesives 
Nothing impressive 
Product works but not enough tape supplied 
Needs more tape

These work! 
It's just OK 
Not exactly what I expected 
Cleans well but has to be replaced often 
Ehh?? 
Better ones out there 
Falls apart 
I like the product but doesn't last long 
a piece of the sponge broke after a couple of weeks 
Get one with removable nipple brush 
Not great 
A little stiff and suction cup wasn't useful

not really blocks 
mehh. 
Was good but for very short period 
Not for me 
So-so 
good in theory 
over rated but works well 
Mostly worked 
Good for home not for going out 
Too Much Fabric! 
Too hard to put on 
A bit tooooo warm for the summer 
unwieldy and baby doesn't always love it. 
Useful but cumbersome 
Have to constantly adjust bulky hot 
Moby Wrap - has potential but possibly not for my baby 
Not easy to use 
OK (though warm and not always comfortable) 
Not as good for bigger babies? 
Great for new babies especially! 
Not for preemies. Description is false. 
Nice but not my favorite 
Daughter liked it..didn't love it 
Meh. 
frustrating 
Takes too long to put on and requires a lot of time and patience to practice 
Hated it at first.. 
Very comfortable and allows skin to skin contact but a hassle to get on 
Inconvienient 
Overpriced 
I suppose it works for some people but not for me. 
Prefer my Ergo

Not needed 
Hard to take off 
Hard to put on and remove 
Barely used 
Functionally ok but installing/attaching is a pain

Functional 
Clamps are awkward 
Not entirely necessary 
Good but not the same. 
nice idea 
Good concept hard to stay on 
They're not bad 
Should have skipped these and bought Pumpin Pals 
Pretty Big 
Large and clunky 
works alright but nothing special 
Good cup holder hardly used. 
Whats up with the automatic shut off? 
Awkward on my Graco Cleo 
Smells and its SUPER hard to put together!!! Corners were damaged badly!!

The wheels are too small 
Good features but needs improvement 
could be better 
Okay

Slight leaking after a few uses

Chenille Crib Sheet 
Nice sheets but didn't fit my moses basket 
soft but very thin 
Not as thick as ABC's standard Jersey Crib Sheet 
Not a great fit for our 3\ mattress 
Does not work with the Delta Portable Crib Mattress 
a little thin and a little small. 
Usable 
Ok for the price

Good addition 
NOT a full-size insert 
Great bag for the price but lacks some features 
Okay but not great.

Babies are different... 
Too rigid. 
Easy to clean but awkward fit 
not what i was ordering... 
Feels fairly sturdy difficult/time consuming to install. 
does the job 
music is too fast lights too bright and fast 
Nice price but pretty thin material 
Fits well but thin 
not as pictured 
It works but not the best 
Toddler Harness 
It's ok... 
Wasn't for us 
It's nice but don't expect a miracle 
Still not sure about this 
Easy to use.. depending on baby 
Bad tub Good Photo Prop 
Not ideal with really itty bitty ones 
Didn't work perfectly for us but I'm glad we had it 
Seems great but not practical 
Works but it's overpriced. 
Might be unnecessary 
This should come with the stroller 
Tray is useless. 
Not impressed 
Does not hold standard sized cups 
Did not work for us 
Installation wasn't as easy as we thought 
Would work great for smaller stairwell posts 
it's ok

Lansinoh Medela Harmony and Avent Pumps Compared 
Hands hurt

Wow if I would have read the Reviews.. 
It's okay 
This thing is huge 
cute idea - ok execution 
Not really pink 
Not quite what I was expecting 
Average.... 
good BUT 
Doesn't work well with crown molding 
it works but not the easiest. 
Yes you have to affix it to wall and made in China 
ouch 
does what it claims 
Nice Wrap...but a little difficult. 
Shoulder Pain 
Steep learning curve 
Good fork spoon is worthless 
small flat and a bit flimsy 
Just ok... 
eh 
This was good and then lost it's goodness 
Pretty good 
Totseat chair... 
Fits on any chair - Baby didn't like it 
plastic sleeves are weird 
Not as cute in person 
Great idea hate the materials used! 
Decent for the price 
Does the job but quality wasn't as expected 
Happy with quality but doesn't fit correctly 
Not for fast growing babies 
Couldn't make it work for us... 
Small window of usefulness.  Fine in early infancy; unsafe for babies who try to stand. 
It comes with hard to remove giant stickers!!!!! 
Too much effort 
If you're flying solo with a toddler don't bother! 
You get what you pay for... 
Not the best design 
just another thing to fiddle with at the gate 
It works but it is unnecessary 
Protects but rips easily 
Bit of a pain but okay overall 
TEARS EASILY but does the job. 
The bag is huge and doesn't close well 
Doesn't fit Graco Snugrider stroller too well 
Made for Smaller Strollers.

Not really great for use over 8 months 
so so 
Just Okay

Ok not the best 
Not good for Evenflo Glass Bottles; Better alternative out there! 
works well for drying bottles 
Lower priced but doesn't hold as much as other models.

What a Hassle! 
Nice plate but suction base doesn't work 
Suction doesn't work but I like the set anyway 
Starting to change shape 
Used to love 'em now I just like 'em 
Plastic is nice but they don't fit much rice 
ok bowls terrible lids 
3 stars for the 3 usable bowls 
eh 
Ok for crackers but limited uses IMO. (no travel microwave) 
Lids don't fit 
Solid color rather than the translucent in the picture. 
Not a bad brush better than brushes without sponges on top 
Good brush if used correctly 
It is pretty good 
Used to Love -- Not Anymore 
Its hidious why did they make it pink 
Good product until it broke 
It's okay but... 
Sponge tears easily 
Does the job but is too short 
Works well just falls apart 
Great until it broke 
nipple brush is too thick but otherwise good 
Nothing Special 
Doesn't last 
nipple brush doesn't have enough brissles and gets rusty quickly 
kind of flimsy but it depends on # of uses 
It's ok for the price 
Nipple brush keeps falling off after 2 months of usage 
Bad for formula great for snacks 
Does the job but could be better. 
Formula doesn't stay in individual compartments 
It's okay. 
It's okay but Avent is better 
Sturdy product. 
Theres this nifty container a platic bag or a dollar store container. This is what should be used!  : ) 
Ok for short trips 
OK product packaging was awful! 
Milk Mate Storage Containers Better 
my baby said no 
Not the ducky I ordered 
Okay... 
Keeps snack contained... 
Not super practical 
Nice idea but not that practical... 
Nice but it came just one 
Great Idea Not Practical 
Kind of big for an infant 
cute 
Picture is misleading 
Just OK 
too big for my daughter's mouth 
Best babyproofing solution out there but there must be a better way 
does the job 
Nice to have but grocery bags are just as good. 
Works Fine Would Recommend SASSY Bags Instead 
These are doggie bags 
Nice Add On 
It's okay 
Good for storage 
Serves its purpose 
Doesn't hold very many Tommee Tippee bottle parts

Wish the bottom were shallower

Nice color and style- VERY THIN 
You Get What You Pay For 
Really thin 
Very thin 
Good for the price 
Rough 
Cannot be steam cleaned :( 
To each his own...my baby prefers these more as chew toys over pacifiers 
\Colors May Vary?\ 
Good pacifier but read the fine print. 
Too big for little baby 
So so 
Cute Design - But had my regrets later on 
I don't like it but there seems no better choice out there. 
Loved the mat for a while but... 
baby started tearing up floor 
Connection issue. 
Too many pieces and only a little less garish 
Pretty but hard to clean 
Not good for crawlers 
Classy Foam Playmat 
Way too much background noise if you use a noise machine 
Very sensitive monitor 
Pretty much does its job... 
Not the best 
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor 
ok monitor 
Just OK 
So-so Monitor 
Ok if you don't plan on leaving the house 
Interference issues 
Good basic monitor for the price 
Takes a little tweaking and patience but does the job. 
Weird noises clicks on and off for no good reason 
The best of a mediocre range of choices UPDATED 4 of 5 stars... 
Good monitor but... 
Just okay 
Weird shape but still loves the taggies 
As good as it guess so far it seems 
not so firm... 
Disappointed. 
my baby sleeps well 
Mixed Review...good piece but odd size 
Good for car seat not so much a stroller 
check it out in store first before order

Fun but tricky to use

Don't really use it much 
Nice toy but not really practical 
not as great as imagined 
okay 
Used on Britax Marathon

It won't stay on 
Looks good 
OK but doesn't keep baby interested for long. 
Son loves it but quality not the best 
It's just ok... 
Three Stars 
okay I guess 
booster seat 
never use it 
Sort of fits all my stuff. 
Heavy & Bulky 
Cute basket but small 
all lowercase 
Gets the job done 
Letters are a little smaller than I expected Colors are confusing for a Child 
smelled so bad 
Fun but magnet is small 
Not enough fish and fish float belly up 
ok 
It's okay nothing special 
Only OK 
Disappointed in Munchkin 
The magnets are weak. 
Fun but didn't realize they are squirters 
Spend your money elsewhere 
Review for BABY JOGGER CITY SELECT 
GET THE SKIP HOP FITS CITY VERSA 
Purchased it for the Baby Jogger City Mini 
It is really just okay 
just okay 
its ok... 
good idea poor quality! 
Perfect for our BOB but they've doubled the price 
Kind of weird... 
Good idea 
Pilling. 
More For Looks Than Use 
Good for back support 
Good for awhile then it just falls apart 
A little too thick for me 
Pretty Good 
Ok but not great 
Just okay 
Eh... Okay diaper 
Bulky and hard to dry but cute 
Eco-friendly but doesn't keep in messes. 
It's OK but not my first choice 
I like the idea of soft  flannel inside but 
Wish I could use it. 
Best as inner doubler for heavy flow or solo for very light flow. Absorbs rapidly 
Okay 
overpriced 
Would not recommend 
Cute but never worked correctly 
Cute 
Nice idea but the Baby doesn't really follow Fiona... 
Want to trow Fred off the roof... 
Does help motivate crawling but annoying. 
Broke easily but great customer service 
Worst sound EVER 
I like this product except that it does not suction down ... 
Okay 
Good product 
I want to like these but... 
Nice playmat for infants 
I want to give this 5 stars but... 
Could Be Better 
Fun Playmat 
About average

Too sensitive... 
\Brown\ is said with a frown. LOL!!! 
Cute but kinda crazy.. 
Okay... 
Just OK 
Ok 
Good product 
OK 
One foot quit working. 
Overprices on Amazon 
I guess my little guy isn't a \lovie\ kind of guy 
Cute but small. Nothing amazing. 
Soft and sweet lovey/security blanket 
Wish it was organic - polyester is not good for children (or adults) 
Didnt work for me but tasted good 
Great product! 
Get the mixed box 
Works well but only for a short period. 
Didn't work :( 
I'm not in love with it. 
Eh... 
They're okay 
Cheap mirror but I can tell what my child is doing. 
Small mirror 
alright 
Good quality; small for my baby! 
Quickly outgrown 
Not a good size 
The other reviewer is right. It shrinks! 
use these as an insert to cloth diapers 
Premium Bleached Prefolds 
Preemie 2 ply aren't worth it. 
Not good for FOLDING 
Fits perfectly. We aired it out outdoors for two ... 
lower buckle is a problem 
Very cute however... 
nice lamp 
Nice but noisy... 
These don't exactly fit older versions 
Good product 
Looks and works well but disappointed in installation options 
too small to enclose but used to block section of room 
comfortable but... 
At least the baby can use it... 
Jungle Fun  -  Quality not as good as Alex toys bath toys. 
My son has no interest in these 
Decent 
Nice idea but lacking 
Ok but for the tray 
The Good and the Bad 
Not what I expected 
Great Before Baby Learned to Pull It Off 
too small 
not so good 
Works great but cheaper at the store 
Gives me peace of mind! 
Pricey but worth it for peace of mind 
Highly sensitive to heat! 
hard to clean and put together 
Not worth the hassle to me 
I don't prefer them but my wife does.... 
Slow flow but not much else resembles natural breastfeeding 
our baby loves it but... 
I should've researched other products. 
Cute but Disappointed 
I wouldn't call this \Bestever\ it's just ok... 
Comfy for the baby 
it would be the BESTever if it were a little bigger 
Doesn't wash well 
NOT machine washable 
Splat Mat 
Cute and a good size 
Thicker than Underpants but Not Enough to Absorb Much 
Just OK 
Nice product 
Adorable 
super cute but bulky and not toddler friendly. 
Adorable - but never really used it 
Hard to unclip the \tail\ 
Harness is good but no space in \backpack\ 
No real complaints. 
Does the job cute 
Very dark can't really see baby. 
I wanted to love these . . . 
Works Well 
Works like it's supposed to - shipping left a lot to be desired 
Never could get this thing comfortable for baby 
Good wrap 
great for newborn but didn't fit long 
Just ok. 
Didn't fit right 
I really want to like this. 
Product is good but size chart not so 
sizing wrong 
Its OK

Baby carrier 
Too stretchy and floppy for my baby... 
Not for me 
Runs small 
Followed the size chart 
Same as Moby...

Did not with well for us. 
Disappointed and not what I expected. 
Not quite what I hoped. 
Not for me 
Sizing is really tricky 
Pretty Good 
Wish it came with caps 
I No Longer Use Ameda Products! Buy Medela instead! 
It serves its purpose but would not call this 'convertible' not to mention 'portable' 
Idea is good but baby hates it. 
Beautiful Parasol 
cloth diapers 
Good but a bit rough and strange shape 
Does what it says but awfully uncomfortable. 
no really needed 
poo goes through 
Not universal! Check your outlet design carefully before you buy. 
They work... 
Kinda cheap looking 
You get what you pay for. 
okay but the arm munckin ones are better 
Cute keys poorer quality than they used to be 
Son loves it but I am not too crazy 
Child's potty chair 
Smart Design - Elevated Chair too High 
almost too much of a boost. 
Okay 
Eh. 
Works but not great 
Magnifying glass is kind of useless 
Magnifier is a hazard but otherwise these are ok. 
Meh... Works fine but no more special than others 
Does the job 
Nice product 
Magnifier doesn't help 
Clippers Work But Magnifier Not Worth It 
Good for Babies 2 months+ 
Good but some design problems - there are better clippers out there 
Does the job. 
Okay but not the best 
Kinda pointless 
Had difficulty using even w/ magnifying glass. 
durable 
Good enough nail clipper but magnifier is pretty useless 
i never use the mag glass 
Not good as I expected. 
Works Great - Until it breaks 
Good whle it lasts

guan2048 
Proably better off boiling your bottles 
so so 
not necessary 
Used it for a month... 
Its Ok but could be better. 
Can't get baby to sleep on it 
not completely sold 
I liked my Babies R Us Changing Pad Better 
Doesn't always stay in place... 
Not good for other bottles 
Ok but not great. 
Still leaks difficult instructions to give to a caregiver to use 
Cute but a bit tricky 
Okay 
Doesn't stay awake 
Not a fabulous quality product 
You get out of it what you put into it 
Seems to be the best toddler clock available... However overpriced 
Works ok but a pain to set up 
its ok 
Keeping it bc it's too much of a hassle to return 
Crib quality 
ok quality ok price great packaging 
Bought the basket and the liner together 
Low price low quality 
It's okay... 
It's okay 
Meh 
seems a bit tempermental 
Does the job 
Not a good fit for us 
Lots of work with limited usage 
helpful 
Worked and didn't work 
ok pillow could be better 
on the short side 
Great product but sizing is WAY off 
Okay for some my son hates it. 
BIG 
Pup Pals Smells Funny 
IT's HUGE! 
Love this but it is HUGE 
Workable but not great. 
Love Halo but this is a giant sack not safe for walking toddler 
Love the idea 
Watch the sizing 
Very Big! 
Good crib for the price/one wrong part 
Nice Crib 
Crib has just been re-engineered - now too small for standard size mattress!!!! 
It does the job 
Didn't know what to expect 
\Okay\ 
Better Products Out There 
For us yes for someone else 
Works well but the spoon is too deep 
It's ok 
Cute 
great idea but wouldn't buy it again 
Boon Ball 
It's okay 
Good size but not great 
Too big for my nine month old 
I thought you were irreplaceable... I was wrong. 
Could be better... 
A great swing in theory but both my children didn't like it. 
Not for squirmers. 
Good for what it is 
Disappointed in adjustability. 
Fun activity for babies 
Nice idea but our baby was easily bored by it 
nice 
Just O.K. 
Would have been perfect.... 
Didn't fit on our doors. 
lots of fun but a pain to adjust to height 
So far...average 
Meh. 
Baby loves it but it has a major flaw! 
good quality short-lived 
good not great 
Not for young babies 
My baby prefers the walker 
It worked as it should but there are more useful bouncers out there.. 
Fabric toys not washable 
Good quality bad battery 
Love a lot about it but it's only OK. 
Safe but extremely heavy 
I want to love it but they Shrink! 
I like that they are organic but sort of poor quality 
OK 
It's ok but the Munchkin one is Better 
Daughter doesn't like them 
Hard to open 
It's a good idea but my baby wasn't into it. 
Nice quality but too small to cuddle 
Nic ewalker doesn't work well on carpets 
Not Made For Short Babies 
Baby loves it 
Baby loves it...annoying problem for me though. 
Product Modifications Made for Outdoor Use 
... our daughter refused to stay inside and felt its like a gail so we had to get a bigger ... 
nipples collapse 
Good for using with the medela pump... 
another trick for new moms to navigate around 
Bought this for the collars 
Average Bottle for an average baby 
Meh 
The nipples on this bottle are horrible but the bottles are GREAT for milk storage 
Flimsy nipples and bottles are why these are back in the box 
great for pumping into but the oz markers wear off quickly 
Decent bottles but not my fav 
If you want to get another full night's sleep I definitely recommend buying a mattress with springs! 
Cute but........ 
It's okay 
Jumps great... toys not so great 
Concept is great product could use some upgrades. 
ehh 
Dissapointed 
seat too wide 
Not for chunky babies 
The toy is fun! 
Good but  color is not  as bright as shown in the picture 
Okay for the money but nothing fancy 
Ok but adhesive isn't good. 
don't fit drawers 
Not for side use - on top of cabinets only 
Don't work well on flush-front drawers 
Decent lock for price but has minor issues 
Good Construction but not for every application 
Not great not horrible.

so-so 
loose and wiggly... oh dear. 
not a chair a toddler can settle into... 
its ok 
Flimsy Lid 
I was expecting more 
Too Flimsy for the Price 
Can't really tell if they work 
Functional product cumbersome to use better than nothing.. 
Does not roll well 
it does the job 
Good for the price makes travel easier 
ok but doesn't fit all car seats! 
Already used it. 
A tight fit w/ the Graco FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect Travel System 
Childress Car Seat Travel Bag vs. Glad Forceflex garbage bag 
Useful but ripped on  first use... 
Really stays put but foam does not withstand squirmy kids or biters 
Colorado Heat 
my back! 
Excellent If You Have a Good Back and a Light Baby... 
lighter babies only & no large parents 
Baby Bjorn or which of three types of Ergos? From a mom of twins with doctor's tips 
Nice but made for men 
complex to put on 
Baby Bjorn vs Beco vs Ergo 
Better than \Original\ but Ergo Baby is still best... 
One major concern 
I really wanted this to work... 
Still trying to figure it out 
Not The Easiest To Use 
havent used it but it seems ok 
durable but tight 
way too short!!! 
Small 
Cute but not sturdy 
Good for toys but will not keep near my baby 
Very thin. 
Returned it never used it 
Nice cover but doesn't fit my moses basket 
Nice but not for the price 
Does the Job 
Ok

Cute frame PITA to update 
Balls are fun to play with 
Good for the Price but Not AMAZING 
Good balls nothing special 
Not really that much fun 
Nice quality 
Nice looking but narrow and hard to adjust 
It's ok looks great works well enough but closes behind you automatically (which may or maynot be a good thing) 
Decent but shows signs of wear fast 
No hardware to mount to wall included 
High quality gate. Great finish 
Difficult to open and close when pressure mounted 
Hardly use it

Decent but not great 
Handle pinches my hands 
Not the best... 
Meh

Okay but not great 
These don't seem to be as sturdy as they once were... 
Hard to Drink/ Hard to Clean 
Great cup but a few disapointments.... 
Good handles size but mold builds up

Cleaning is an issue...customer service not helpful 
Item came in dirty

Okay... 
Cute toy my baby is not impressed though

My 3-6 month son is not too interested 
good toy 
Decent toy 
A good car ride toy 
Decent fun 
Works fine but too bright 
We like this for car rides and Dr. offices 
Too FLASHY - Try a glowworm instead 
Okay toy 
Not What I Expected 
Not sure what all the hype is about... 
This would be great if it has soft fabric body/touchpad 
ok 
Not sure I'd recommend 
Good toy but not what we needed 
Good Product But Doesn't Hold Baby's Attention 
does not stay in the baby mouth 
Can't see them at night 
Just ok 
Pretty but not as functional as I'd hoped. 
Smaller than it looks 
I expected more 
Not Bad for a Smaller Bag 
Nice quality bag but way too small! 
Durable but a bit small 
Great pattern and pockets but too small 
would skip if I had a do over 
Too small... 
i picked this one so i hope it works out! 
Just okay 
You can but lipstick on a cardboard and polyester bag but... 
I'm on the fence w/this bag... 
On the heavy side 
Disappointing 
Saw in the store but didn't buy 
Good Storage/Many Useful Pockets - But the body of the bag was too narrow 
Good but not great 
Stuff falls out! 
Love the look but function....questionable 
With use developed some ripping around the seams; Skip Hop replaced. 
Well made but too small 
Wasn't big enough for my needs but seems to be of great quality 
We ended up replacing it with a bigger bag.... 
No what i thought it would be 
The camera added 10 pounds 
starter bag 
A Diaper Bag that won't go out of fashion 
If you want something with zipper this is not for you! 
Much Smaller Than Expected 
A little big 
A bit bulky! 
Works as expected but nothing special 
Does the job but the material wrinkles easily. 
Pain in the rear to iron 
Very wrinkled 
Works great only when you're crib mattress is at the highest level 
... it were a little longer to fit the crib better. The material is very sheer and wrinkles very ... 
Returned It 
Be wary of the color 
Just Okay 
Quite small 
Doesn't fit my Babyletto Hudson crib 
cute 
Not what I was looking for 
nice chair but not ideal for older baby 
Buy the Red caddy version instead 
Alright odd distance from table 
For younger babies 
Buy in burlington coat factory for 1.99$ 
Thought this would help but not so much 
Good for some things... 
its just ok 
Very cute but mildew easily. 
Easy to install and use---but a few were broken! 
Fine for awhile...then they break 
Meh 
Hard to install 
Not for Uppa Baby G-lite save your time!

Not enough space 
Kinda Small

Really Adorable Utensils - But The Spoon Is Too Big! 
Great idea but the spoon is too flat 
Cute Nice Carrying Case But Not My Favorite 
great fork ok spoon 
Cute but not perfect 
Not the best quality 
Watch your baby's fingers when spinning! 
Loved it at first but now very annoying 
if you want to get in a fight with your spouse... 
Most arrive damaged and cannot be returned 
Good Item But Could Use Improvement 
These are just \ok\ 
my baby didnt like these 
Like Soothies but better 
Eh it's okay 
PLEASE BE AWARE!! 
Not all babies love it 
nice shape wish they were softer 
I wish my son liked pacifiers... 
Doesn't turn off 
It's good BUT 
tray feels low quality-- but it does what it's supposed to. 
broke for no reason after 1 year 
Works well but still not that useful. 
It works but set-up left my husband grumbling 
Product works. Installation potentially tricky. 
Leaks wanted to love it. 
Worth buying but beware

Nice Product 
Nice but not necessary 
Test a friends before buying if possible 
Nice chair but didn't work for us 
Good but not great

It's a rattle! 
Just an OK rattle--there are better ones out there. 
Rattle 
Cute but haven't used 
Just OK 
JUST A RATTLE 
I Like But Baby Uninterested 
Great first rattle - don't give to your child until they are older 
Cute-but baby not into it yet. 
Okay 
It's a Rattle 
Smaller than I thought they were 
Bummer 
Teething necessity..... 
The flower shape is great--the hearts not so much. 
Good teether 
Okay... 
Have yet to see the benefit of these... 
not the colors as pictured 
nice 
Not very noisy 
A little hard... 
Not bad but not great 
Not the same as pictured and wish there was more to soothe the gums 
Okay 
Not our favorite 
Baby didn't take to it 
Clear reception but battery issue 
Quit Working after 2 months 
they're okay 
Nice blanket but... 
Good size but just okay fabric

Is this a joke? 
You can live without it 
My Baby loves it but watch out! 
Super Soft Fabric But Not That Great 
CHEST CLIP BROKE! Ergo was purchased in a boutique- definitely ORIGINAL. 
Ok for a carrier 
Size Matters 
Good but still looking for the perfect carrier 
Light and Sturdy 
Good but still makes my back hurt 
Difficult to put on 
Average 
might be a fake? 
ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier (camel color) 
Not easy to put on by yourself while holding baby at the same time like you are supposed to! 
ok carrier 
I don't understand the ERGO love fest.... 
not slow enough for my 1 mo old 
wide base seems misleading but they function fine 
it's ok 
Takes up too much room. 
Everything is great except color 
I like the Item 
yeah it's ok... 
Good fit comfortable but break easily 
They collapse! 
They are what they are 
Haven't used it much 
ok 
OK... with reservations 
Good seat terrible seat belt 
It's okay 
Works fine for babies 
This is NOT the Cadillac Booster Seat 
Good chair for the cost 
Okay for the price but wouldn't buy again 
Decent Reclining Chair for the Price 
ok 
Nice for the baby beginning to sit 
Fun but My Baby Tends to Lean to the Side 
Not for chubby babies. 
Works fine not great.  Don't overthink this one there are plenty of other baby products to overthink. 
I've used better! 
Good but like a different brand better. 
Not my favorite... 
Its okay my daughter perfers the FP Jumperoo 
Shop for a deal 
Not worth the investment. 
Cool but now it's too late 
It's an ok toy 
Stopped the screams 
It's ok...read why 
Annoying but my daugther loves it. 
Similar to fast flow 
Make sure you buy the right nipples for your bottle system 
Why Velcro? 
Cute but gets hot 
Not what I expected and I probably won't buy them again 
Nice but be careful with wood tables 
Nice in theory but babies will figure out how to get this off the table! 
The adhesives don't peel off very well 
Tiny nice fabric poor quality zipper 
Good little bag but there are quality issues. 
It does what it says 
just ok 
Fine but no miracle 
Great Pump TERRIBLE Bag 
Ok product... 
Great product not very useful for me though. 
Think before you buy 
Love the pump but have an issue with the breastshield 
Lots of room for improvement 
Too Noisy/Wierd Sounding; Flimsy Material Bag 
Not for breasfeeding 
it works 
Good in a pinch but buy the battery pack if you don't plan on pumping in the car all the time 
Convenient but... 
As others noted doesn't seem to draw the same ... 
Not for me. 
They work pretty well but there are better ones out there 
Why I like the Lansinoh ones better... 
Not impressed 
A good addition 
Hard to get an impression but easily malleable 
Cute momento 
Not so fool proof 
It's Manageable 
A little weird but sweet 
Easy to do... but final product is soft 
Not Thrilled 
Worked so so 
Worked... but... 
ehh ok but could be a lot better 
Beautiful but FP needs to make one major improvement! But I found a solution!!! 
Couldn't Use It-Baby Hated It. 
Low quality high price 
Beautiful; but flawed! 
bulky design 
Zen Collection Infant Seat 
Looks great but doesn't do much 
Didn't use much 
It's very pretty but my baby doesn't really care for it 
Nice to look at but hating the tray! 
Very over-rated but it gets the job done 
A good swing until... 
Unfortunately 3-Stars 
My baby didn't like it 
PUT IT TOGETHER SLOWLY!!!! 
Wish it lasted longer 
It's okay...I wouldn't have bought it.  Pros Cons & Things that don't make sense 
Swings too fast for newborn/barely any room for shoulders 
Okay not great 
Take or leave it 
Son never really took to it 
Like not love. 
Great Until They Leaked 
couldn't read the small print 
They have their pros and cons 
I have two of these so why only 3 stars 
Still like Britax Marathon better but this is OK 
Decent booster seat 
Graco Nautilus vs. Britax Frontier 85 SICT 
Good seat but cleaning is a PAIN 
a few cons 
Comfortable for kid but very difficult to assemble 
good size 
The buckle is so hard 
Good for second vehicle 
Not for my baby 
Wish it was padded a bit more! 
It's good but with a few hiccups... 
please read reviews about the crotch strap! 
One big flaw 
Not A Rear Facing Car Seat 
The recline is a joke 
Maybe it's just ours? 
One big flaw. 
Good safe seat- some dissapointment 
Don't like the buckles 
carseat 
Horrible headrest + buckle go for a Frontier 
I bought two 
Good value but not my favorite 
Great for the money 
The old are great the newer ones not so much... 
Does the trick but straps are hard to adjust and seat cushion slides 
Not Rear Facing 
Really depends on your child... 
Zipper should be on other side 
acceptable carseat 
Not the easiest to use 
decent car seat but base cuts into the seat of our car. 
Good value for the price 
Well.....I like the color 
Liked in the past but hate now 
Good seat but 
Barely Fits Safety 1st Complete Air 65 Convertible Car Seat 
RIPS TOO EASY 
Works but bulky 
Good in concept barely used 
Works great 
bit too small for our carseat 
Does work 
Fits great 
Cool Cover 
Useful but not durable 
Pretty hard use for rear facing car seat 
Not sure it helps 
Not sure if it makes a difference 
I guess it works? 
Works but tough to get on 
fussy baby didn't care for 
depends more on the bottle design 
Awkward 
watch the flow speed! 
It works when it stays on the doorknob 
:( 
at nine months my baby won't use it yet 
very big bad quality 
Scared 
Post instructions for adult use at your next party. 
Okay But Not Well-Made 
not worth it for the price 
Don't understand all the hype... 
It is nice but... 
Nice blankets but wow are they expensive! 
Swaddle wraps 
These are cute.. I love them. 
I am not quite sure why everyone is so in love with these 
1 of the 4 is no good 
too expensive 
I didn't like the colors 
Good size the tops are really hard to get off. 
little bowls 
Not long enough to keep as toddler bed 
Cute but not worth it in the end 
Want to Love this crib 
Sliding down in seat 
Works OK with Virgin America planes 
Not for skinny children 
Yes it is not perfect but better than just the airplane belt 
good in theory 
Didn't work 
OK but toddlers can remove the restraint if they unhook the airplane seat belt 
Returned it. 
It's just okay - better than lugging the carseat on the plane! 
Overpriced and did not stand the test of time 
Super small Rubber Ducky Ducks 
good 
Some good some not 
Great range and that's about it... 
Product is already obsolete - can't get replacement parts from Safety 1st 
Nice but overpriced

Super strong smell 
moldy 
It's OK 
Didn't suit us 
Do the job but are thin 
Great at first but after wear they're not staying on 
Good for the cost 
It's alright for the price 
I would not buy again 
Not the ones in the picture 
Good and Not so good 
Rough fabric Decent Pattern 
This one fit the bit and was very adorable so I snatched it up 
Fits the pillow ok 
little small 
A pretty alternative but not durable. 
Two different sponges 
I am okay with it 
Its kind of leaky. 
seems tight 
Not impressed 
diaper covers 
Fits as specified hate the velcro 
Meh okay not the best for us 
Ehh.. it did the job 
fits well but lee elastic goes fast 
ok not great 
Good idea 
Snugride is more like Sweaty Ride 
great buy shows dirt 
Why did I buy the smallest version?? 
Wanted to love the Ergo but couldn't 
It'll do. 
Cute but junk 
Nice & does the job 
So-so product 
like that it's organic but too small to really be useful 
not sure what they are for 
It's decent 
Not as firm as the lightweight version 
limited use 
Great Concept - but not a fit for my stroller 
Mediocre...but small hands love to turn the wheel... 
Baby loves it but irritation factor is high for adults 
Great for learning but not so much for cleaning 
Fine but trashbags work just as well! 
Stinky 
Prepare to hold it for baby 
Cute but vibrate function hard to get 
John Deere Corn Teether 
Not worth it 
Cute but not as good as the star version 
Gift 
It's great as a bumper pad but easy for baby to move around 
it's just ok 
Rather difficult to put on! 
Its ok not really necessary 
Mixed feelings on this item. 
It does what it's supposed to do... 
my baby kicked under this bumper on day one 
I would buy again but slightly false description 
Just okay... 
Good and Bad 
Great only for a newborn 
Great concept 
Very good under 7 months 
Not for pulling up? 
better than a traditional crib liner 
Okay. It slowly works its way down the crib. 
not for us 
Keeps Legs and Arms In 
Its okay. 
not much of a bumper 
Doesn't fit back side properly but it works 
Okay. 
does it's job 
Doesn't stay put 
Attention Designer of This: Needs Tweaking 
Looks good 
Did not fit my crib 
Ok.  Make sure you measure the height first. 
Doesn't fit as snug as described 
Undecided 
Doesn't fit nicely around the crib and too thin to reduce bruises 
waste of money? Very polyester. 
Keeps the pacifier in the crib 
It's an okay liner. 
This is good but is far from perfect 
Good product 
Good for a while 
If you care how it looks try something else if you have a solid-end crib 
It's OK 
Breathable Bumper 
Not quite a perfect fit 
Perfect but... 
It's okay

Not dishwasher safe even on top rack 
Great Beginner Spoon/ Stains Quickly/ Heat Indicator Not Too Useful 
Stain easily 
Okay 
strange... 
These spoons are okay but not my favorite 
useful but small 
Eh. 
Great for convenience; very mediocre for pumping 
Expected a better pump 
Disappointed with its performance! 
Convenient and portable but VERY SLOW 
Beware - Lactation Consultants Advise Against This Pump 
Works okay but is too loud and spills too often. 
Nice to get things done while pumping but horrible letdown 
watch out for spilled milk! 
Okay but not worth the extra cost 
three and a half stars 
A must but very poorly designed. 
Works well if all other dishes are clean 
Okay 
Fits bottle parts only fits 3 bottles. 
Could be better 
Munchkin is better and holds more bottles 
VERY large 
Nice lightweight fabric but my baby can wiggle out 
Colors Vary NOT RETURNABLE

My daughter doesn't like it 
Not my baby's favorite 
cute bottle but my baby doesn't agree.

Does the job but not our favorite 
Great bottle but hate the nipples 
No evidence no damage no customer service 
Not thrilled with the velcro attachment and height 
Didn't work for us - not the greatest design 
Good but there's better 
Slightly disappointed. 
Not very comfortable 
cheap fabric piled up after 1 wash 
Nice until washed 
Doesn't fit the pack and play

Pretty good. 
Shrinks lengthwise but super soft. 
Great at first but morphs over time 
Not so soft

Great colors 
Good quality but too small 
Cute but can really only use 1 side 
Not awful but don't need more 
Pretty but not practical 
Stiff material 
These are ok but a wash cloth does the same thing

Looks vs Function 
Only the terry cloth side is absorbent. 
Cute But Scratchy & Not Very Absorbent. 
Cute but not very practical 
Cute... 
Cute but not the best quality 
just ok 
Cute but... 
Generous size but not as soft as I had hoped 
beautiful but... 
It's a fairly low quality decorative towel 
Not soft/plush 
Not as nice as I expected 
Manly and nice looking but really too small to be a diaper bag. 
Bought 3 and used them twice in 7 months 
Average washcloths 
Decent washcloths but nothing out of the ordinary 
prefer the snap n go 
Not Needed 
Baby jogger makes some great stuff not too impressed with this though. 
for the same price buy a cheap stroller frame for your carseat. 
It works 
DOES NOT WORK ON CITY SELECT MODEL! Make sure you order the right one! 
We haven't found this useful. 
Much larger than I expected. 
same as regular clipper 
Can't really see the baby's nails 
Okay 
Light is a plus but the clippers are not very sharp. 
Light button is a design flaw 
Baby Nail Clippers 
bad design 
Light doesn't help me 
Hate the light feature 
Ok 
Not my favorite swaddle blanket 
Nice product but for smaller babies only 
too many bells and whistles 
Makes tummy time tolerable 
Not too thrilled 
just ok 
Ehhh 
Nice mat - not a miracle however 
Cute but my daughter didn't use it long 
Just ok. 
Great idea 
Makes Tummy Time a little more tolerable 
boring... 
Real cute  but does not fit on the high chair tray 
Works but still able to move 
Successful ... for about 10 minutes 
Cute designs but the suction ring comes off 
A little disappointed 
Cute plate but suction base is pointless 
Wore out to quickly 
Great Looking Just Not Durable 
They don't hold much... 
Fat mouth! 
Not sure how I feel about these 
Spoons are a bit large for toddler's mouth 
Cute pattern small neck hole. 
Love the design but haven't held up well 
Cute but not as easy to clean as other vinyl bibs 
Regular 
Cute bibs but quality is just okay 
This blanket is not 30\x40\

Mostly works if you use it according to instructions; tends to run warm 
I would get it again 
It works ok 
Good for Travel - not everyday 
It's sort of pricey 
Very Cute 
Doesn't stick to tub/Great customer service 
great product but.....one big issue 
Thin 
Nice

Eh 
Good price - Shrinks 
Good but a little rough 
Won't Buy Again 
not so great 
A little too big for my little guy 
Not great for scooping 
I don't love these 
Easy scoop but messy! 
Makes a GREAT teether 
Too Big For Little Mouths 
They're just okay. Sorta good sorta bad. 
Better with accessories 
Undecided 
Not as easy. 
careful with the legs could pinch! 
Useful but not amazing 
meh. no better or worse than other tiny potties really. 
Not sturdy in \potty\ position 
Pointless... 
Never Got to Use It 
I got the reusable liners and re-fills too 
Great portable potty but a bit short 
Good concept but kids not certain.  Maybe after fully-trained. 
Not great for boys going pee 
Buy with Reusable Liner for best results 
Quite low to the ground and too small for a 3 year old 
Doesn't work as well for boys 
unstable as a stand alone 
Great idea but small! 
Gets the Job Done 
Don't squeeze the bottle 
Great crib but NOT great toddler bed! 
Love Naturpedic but this is not their best 
Fits Da Vinci Mini Crib 
Not as firm as I'd like for a newborn... 
It does not seem waterproof... 
cute set but the sheet doesn't fit 
Not really worth the high price 
Our baby ignores it 
Not a favorite 
Nice product but not a baby essential 
This is mostly useless but cute... 
Not what i expected 
Took a few tries and some water to get good results. 
Easy to use but not amazing looking 
Did the job but it's heavy and has cracks 
Good but overpriced 
Easy to use hard clay 
Pretty good.  Subject to recent recall. 
Big 
works well 
DaVinci Emily 2 Sided Crib Mattress 
My baby seems to be comfortable but it doesn't fit my Emily Crib? 
Not worth the price 
This monitor is louder than my sleeping baby. 
Just Okay

Nice Size 
My son loves it but.... 
Glad I just borrowed it 
Works well not easy to hang.

Nice ball and rattle 
Got a blue one for my daughter 
Not as advertised 
Ok product 
Not as advertised 
Pills 
Nice blanket 
Pills a lot! 
Disappointed 
An adequate travel system. 
Does the job 
Break Easily 
Works 
Great for transitioning off of bottle... 
Probably no worse than anything else similar 
Hard to open & close 
Have used for 11 months with first baby will not use for second 
good but leak 
Skeptical 
Meh. 
Okay 
Try another brand first but if it doesn't work try this one 
Opt for the glass ones 
Excellent.....until they start leaking 
Too many parts to clean 
good & bad... 
Leak and hard to clean 
System works... but get wide-neck! 
Didn't reduce spit up 
If you don't make sure to fill correctly they leak 
take forever to dry 
Wares out Quickly! 
Works consistently for a few months but then needs replacing 
Would have been better if it told me I wasn't drunk 
Toddler Helper 
Worked 
Decent product 
Wish I'd tried Munchkin 
Not as good as I thought 
They're too shallow. And they look rather cheap for Gerber. 
Ideally Good but not well balanced and the spoon is shallow 
nice but I don't think you can select the color assortment you receive 
Good product 
JUST OKAY 
Small 
Nice spoons 
I prefer the Ekstra style 
didn't work for me 
This is a fine swim diaper. But be careful in the car! 
Makes transitioning from the pool tricky but great colors! 
Quality construction has minor cons. 
It's okay....but not great. 
Its okay... 
our first failed attempt 
it's ok 
My son loves this swing but it could be much better... 
Cute swing but pretty useless unless you grow batteries 
No AC Adapter but Runs Forever on D.  Rather Loud. 
Great EXCEPT... 
Cute but needs some changes 
Cool but not used that much 
My 9 month old daughter likes it but... 
like don't love 
decent toy my daughter just doesnt care for it 
boring 
Mediocre 
Speaker on the bottom? 
Just wish it didn't have the foam head backing 
Mixed review depending on age 
Be careful during assembly... wobbly legs! 
Baby is happy but daddy is not 
We returned this 
Inexpensive booster seat 
Functional but easy to outgrow 
Love it - But Not Recommended by Experts 
too short 
Hard to release 
Not THAT hard to open 
Works great to lock your cabinets but quite a hassle to remove. 
They're OK 
Baby can peel these off really easily 
They peeled off pretty easily. 
Not so awesome 
Could be better 
just ok 
Okay for some foods 
Cute but motor is a little loud 
Just ok 
The turning mechanism makes a noticeably weird jerking motion each time the mobile turns while in motion 
Cute but loud 
noise with the rotation 
Not for sleigh cribs... 
Fussy baby likes it 
Higher review if it had worked when I received it 
Too small/ Not enough pockets 
Great for older kids not babies 
Functional but un-attractive 
Works ok 
Not available as lid only? 
great lid and replacement cover but silly sippy cup 
These are just the lids!!! 
$$$ for lids that fold too much 
I actually like the little nail files best... 
Lovely but Huge 
A little disappointed 
not comfortable 
Not for me 
I am not a sling fan anymore 
Good but not great 
Not an easy spout 
OK 
Adorable 
Never showed interest 
Okay toy not the best

Crunch stuff moves in the wash 
Eh 
My Dog Loves It! 
Star teething blanket 
It's ok 
Comb Is Good Brush Too Soft 
I wish I liked it more... 
better options out there 
good value but certain drawbacks 
Everything is good but the toothbrush 
Pretty good but quality is not always consistent 
Doesn't cut it for me 
Just ok 
nice but size is small and I'd prefer that both arm straps open 
It is very warm and functional but only good for the first six to nine months 
good design but temperature guide seems off 
The mat works but could be dangerous. 
Does the job 
Cute but stinks and hard to keep clean 
No smell at all little small though and doesnt seem very comfortable 
Very cute but very flimsy 
Some instruments are more fun than others 
Im going to say okay 
Good if you don't have a dog 
This looks like a dog toy! 
Smells good!! 
Baby ignores it 
Baby seems to like this but worried about safety 
great 
better toy ball than teether 
Good size but too hard 
OK toy not the best teether 
Lifefactory Glass Baby Bottle 9 oz 
Great glass bottle poor venting 
my son choked 
Cap doesn't fit very tight 
Just okay 
May be great for other babies but ours pulled them apart every single time. 
Well not too sure 
Nice but too much flex 
This product is just okay 
The links don't link 
Basic links 
The separate from each other and toys. 
Not great 
links are links 
The rings come off easily 
Okay... 
Good Quanitity but really lightweight 
Attach all the things! 
Too heavy for my daughter to sleep with but it makes a great play mat! 
I expected more for the price 
Works as advertised but watch for scratchy edges 
Rubs my kid's skin 
for Booginhead and MAM pacifier combo users i recommend... 
Love the camo 
It's ok 
Good Pacifier Clip 
Too tight 
Works but... 
Pacifier Strap 
Clip is really difficult to unfasten from clothes 
Great quality except the metal part 
Satisfactory. 
Good Soothie Holder 
great idea if it wasn't damaged 
Just another baby accessory 
Used to be great... 
can potential hurt your finger 
Good sturdy clip but long cord 
Super handy for a while 
Initially loved it but the clip rusts? yuck! 
you can try did not work well for me... 
It's okay 
Great idea - needs to be water resistant 
OK but not used much 
Cute and engaging but with a design flaw 
Alright 
I just wish you could set different times. 
Fine for the price....a purchase not an investment 
I wish the waist was adjustable 
Very baggy but they work. 
Typical Plastic Pants 
Meh 
Wanted to love it 
Cute but falling apart already 
Cute but average quality and poor content 
It's Okay 
Wish it was bigger 
Basic ball 
Wish it came on a different cord 
Small pendant 
Not sure about it 
purchased for baby shower 
Meh 
So cute but defective (probably just mine). 
Not so entertaining 
Cute 
Not as Soft As Expected Not Worth the Money 
Smells weird 
SOLID rubber pacifier 
I wanted to like the pacifier but my daughter didn't! 
I really wanted to like this but.... 
baby didnt like it 
I love them... but baby doesn't. 
Just never takes 
Smell/taste is strong 
These didn't work for us 
nipple size is VERY small 
Nothing special. 
Disappointment 
Didn't work for my child 
just not for us 
Liked the idea but not the execution... 
Did not work for us 
Will or won't your baby enjoy this ? 
great idea design flaws (for my baby anyway) 
doesn't stay in... 
Great product but my baby didn't take to it 
Not bad not as good as expected 
Spill proof cup...really? 
Cute cup but leaks 
Multi-use toy expensive bleeds color smallest cup is of a dangerous size 
Our second seat 
Works... sort of.  Rather large given its target demographic 
good concept 
Nice idea...not so great in reality 
Didn't work for us 
Wish I liked it better... 
great stroller but could use some improvements... 
Terrible if you live in a city 
Good but not the best 
Great but eats up batteries! 
Cute idea but.. 
love it 
Great but weird length 
this thing is huge - would never wear it out in public 
Good bottle for baby - but oz markings are deceiving 
Leak out the bottom 
Great nipple shape and air control poor design 
Baby likes it but it leaks and its hard to clean 
Not living up to the hype 
Diaper Pail Lacking in Quality and Functionality 
Yes and then no... 
Big Baby Deuce still = Odor 
Keeps the stink in. Sort of. 
Find a more durable product...not this one 
Just fine but we just don't use it w/just 1 newborn baby 
It was good till it broke 
Don't like customized refills 
Overpriced plastic garbage bin.  Equally functional and lower priced options available. 
I don't know why people rave about this thing 
Only \Meh\ 
Had to Replace 
Good concept sloppy execution 
Still smells.... 
Durable and Works Well But Expensive to Use 
They keep breaking... 
Its a toss up. 
Works fairly well expensive. 
average diaper pail bit pricey for bags 
An Awkward Overpriced garbage can 
Keeps out the odors but refills are expensive 
Great....But Breaks Easily 
Smells... 
Needs to perform its duty better. 
Maybe there is no such thing as a \good\ diaper pail but this isn't it. 
Regular diaper genie is better and less expensive 
Pretty effective but not totally convinced 
Not plug-and-play 
Ok Baby Carrier 
Sleepy wrap is Boba wrap 
Strange contraption... just a long piece of stretchy cloth 
Too much material 
Easy to adjust but too hot 
More of a novelty than useful... 
It's okay 
Great for first purees but nothing past that 
Could use some simple improvements 
So-So Bath Toy 
Better for younger babies 
It is OK.... 
Still has mold potential. 
Nice toy very heavy 
Ok toy not as much fun as I had hoped 
Not as great as others say it is. 
Chep and functional 
Details to fix leaky problem 
It leaks. 
Always shows hotter than it really is 
Expected More 
potty training made easy!! 
Nice chart but way overpriced 
Cute. 
Baby likes having something to grasp; seems a little cheap. 
Cute 
Had high hopes but my child didn't love it 
Okay but the concept is lost.. 
ok bag but lots of drawbacks 
For the price I just didn't love it enough to keep it. 
Too big for me (even though I have twins) 
Really wanted to love it 
Heavy and tips 
Maybe a little too bendy? 
Great for a short period of time when baby is learning to use utensils 
too flexy & too small of a scoop 
This is not a blankie 
You need to \babysit\ this warmer to avoid overheating of the food 
It works ok but could be so much better 
Works great most of the time. 
Disappointed 
Works... But.... 
Philips AVENT Express Food and Bottle Warmer 
It's ok but it's hard but no timer??? 
It works but could be better 
Okay.... sometimes bottles take long time to warm and switch is in a inconvenient place. 
Simple Operations but No Timer or Auto-Off 
eh 
Fast but not not steady 
Wish it dinged when ready 
No automatic shut off 
It's okay but could be a lot better! 
Does the job 
Its ok...hard to tell when the bottle is ready 
Not Quite as Described 
Works fast but can overheat milk 
Does Its Job though has downfalls 
Did not use 
It's ok 
It's ok but I seem to overheat the milk easily 
Handy but Inaccurate 
There are simpler approaches 
Not Mom Friendly 
Does not live up to its hype... 
Better than Philips Avent Express one. 
Functional food warmer. Not well designed. 
Easy to use easy to clean but somewhat unpredictable warming. 
Does the job but with flaws 
Giving a 2nd try 
Quick Cleaning 
Works fine but I wish that they'd come out with BPA free version 
Its Ok 
Easy to use more work to maintain. 
Easy to use stand-alone sterilizer. 
Excellent sterilizer but for the fears about BPA toxicity 
Not poisonous (yay) but not very affordable either. 
Cute 
OK - but Sophie is better! 
I like it more than my daughter does 
Great shape and material but squeaker is annoying 
Not as good as Sophie... 
Nice but these don't warrent their price 
Not a teether for my baby but a great toy 
It is EXACTLY like a dog toy 
Sophie is much better 
Does not hold 1 cup of water.... 
LOVE it 
Good for accidents but will not hold much liquid 
Humm!! 
Doesn't stay put but good cover 
Doesn't hold a lot 
product not what it used to be 
bunches up in diaper 
Good product but not washable 
Meh 
We only use when out and about - they're very thin 
Not perfect but a helper for sticky poo 
Odd shape strange smell 
Work Great 
Liners 
Okay but too thin 
they are soft 
Not soft and a toilet clogger 
OK 
Not working for us. 
They work OK 
Does the job but prefer other brand 
Not for extra sensitive skin!! 
Good Price but Kind of Flimsy 
Use it for 0-3 months 
0-3 months old bibs 
For new baby only 
Good basic blankets 
could be softer and larger 
Not cotton 
Nice toy for young child to make noise with 
Love JJB this print is ok the material not as thick as older versions 
first came broken :( second was ok 
Not bad but.... 
Good pacifiers but don't glow in the dark 
It will suffice 
Great buy but found something better 
Would prefer not to have to line dry 
Does not work on \porous\ tile 
Not bad but doesn't always stay on the wall 
doesn't work on my tiles 
Battery information needs updating 
Looks fun but baby doesn't like it. 
Great product \flaw\ with new materials 
Eh... 
Requires 2 hands to open - not effective 
Cute Pattern; Not User Friendly 
Cute Not very functional. 
Cute but got pink for my boy 
Infant sunglasses 
Quite sturdy for a toddler but too small 
Odd Fabric 
It's ok... 
Don't buy this! 
Can't go wrong with Philips quality and price. 
Nice in many ways but not enough functionality and versatility for general use 
Doesn't stay cold very long 
Mixed feelings 
Pros and cons 
Definitely NOT a must-have but why not?!! 
The better one has mesh siding with snaps 
works but smells 
Terrible off-gassing but fits the Graco Snugride carseat + stroller frame 
Good product / bad smell 
Does the job... 
Ok for occasional use I would not use it daily as your only crib 
It's Alright... Original Looks Better 
Nice but not entirely as advertised... 
Pretty not a lot of coverage 
Great for the bedtime routine 
accidental purchase but I have an opinion on it 
Eats batteries No Adapter Cors 
Shrunk! 
Nowhere near as soft as i anticipated 
Thin 
There's nothing \sateen\ about it but it's not a bad sheet 
Great for the price 
Love the material but the elastic breaks too easily. 
Very soft! 
Soft- but... 
So soft but the elastic gave way 
Elastic breaks easily in washing machine; crib sheets do not wear well 
Son didn't like it. 
great at first but fell apart on first wash 
Nice Soft Sheets Bad Elastic 
Soft warm but poor quality 
Just ok 
Sort of like it... 
Not Happy 
ties are way too short 
Does the job 
Didn't fit my standard sized crib. 
I don't like how they lay in the crib. 
Too tall 
Worth the Price! 
Okay 
It's okay... 
Crib bumper 
Too small 
too tight! 
Cute and Soft Ok Quality 
\Ok\ 
It's a sheet... 
Good at first but not for long term use 
Very soft but shrinks a ton 
shrank after a while 
Carters Easy Fit Jersey Crib Fitted Sheet (White) 
Very soft but a really snug fit - especially after washing 
Soft 
I agree with other reviewers; expensive and poor quality 
Doesn't fit right 
A bit small for the pack n play mattress 
Looks nice but thin... 
not that soft 
okay but there are better options 
They are okay for smaller babies heavyweight 
Okay 
Cute but too small. 
Cardboard 
Adorable but fade quickly 
Thet are fine not awesome 
Very thin. Not double sided. 
Don`t Expect more 
Great for everything except swaddling 
Great for other uses but just okay for swaddling 
Love the design but they don't wash very well 
dont wash very well... 
Smells awful 
Cute pattern but weak thread count. 
carters 
It's OK 
Cute 
Nice sheet but it is pretty snug 
Okay for what it is but not needed 
Good and Bad 
Better the bag gets ruined than the seat... 
Poor quality but does the job 
You'll need accessories 
nightmare to install 
Very average 
Good for what it is and what it cost 
You don't need these. 
CUTE but a bit hard to install 
Colorful but not very functional 
Great pattern but not quite as nice as the rest of the chair 
Not what I expected.. 
Velcro has its downsides... 
My child takes it off his crib 
Bottle design is nice nipples are not. 
Good cup 
I like the idea.....baby DOES NOT 
Don't like the mesh 
Sizing is VERY large 
Good wearable blanket ... until the zipper malfunctioned! 
I had bad luck with the zippers 
It's a fine product but underused. 
doesn't fit right 
Does the job but not sure if needed 
OKay 
Bottles fall over 
Kinda sucks 
Ended up not needing it 
Does the Job 
Love the sheets but they fit small 
versitle but zipper doesnt hold up well 
Not as good as swaddle me 
zipper stuck! baby trapped! arm holes too small 
Not impressed - **edited** 
Two different styles of Halo swaddle sack 
Not as good as their fleece sleep sacks 
good idea but has some flaws 
Sleep sack is great swaddler can't be removed 
Did not work great with the swaddle attachment 
good quality 
Great blanket weak swaddle 
Like it but baby can get arms out too easily. 
Not the best 
Not the tightest swaddle 
Love the concept but... 
Not good enough for my Houdini 
Never used it 
Good only for short time 
Okay 
Stitching came apart after 1 wash... 
Did not work for my Baby but still worth a shot 
My baby wouldn't stay in it 
By the time my baby fit into this swaddling wasn't needed. 
Nicely made 
Great idea but has some design flaws 
It is alright for the price but the swaddle does not detach 
Grumble grumble stupid sleep sack 
Wish they were of cotton instead and had a better zipper 
Don't like the mesh 
Perhaps better suited for older toddlers 
so so... 
Weird handle 
A little too big 
Sturdy durable not so soft 
Nice material fit is off. Probably don't need if you have a good mattress. 
Expensive for what it is 
Not that great 
Does the job but blocks view 
Really big 
IT IS PRETTY 
Not my favorite 
Can take a beating but to many useless pockets 
Nice looking and decently functional but lots of issues 
I like it but... 
It is ok but nothing out of this earth. 
Great features but some major downsides too! 
Baby leg stuck 
Soft but not as good as Baby Soy 
Great bodysuit but could use a little improvement 
Not for long-bodied kids 
nice fabric.. 
Rail Cover 
Wish I'd Looked at Pinterest First 
Not waterproof! 
Didn't use it 
Overpriced 
ok 
Works as they should 
works pretty well 
Does the job 
Wish these had lasted longer 
helpful but not always well made 
Inexpensive but frays too easily. 
Not really a \must have\ item 
Decent 
Not so great 
Handy 
Good but not great 
Decent purchase 
Great for some toys 
OK but could be improved 
Good for toys not for sippy cups 
Good Enough... 
Great concept...but they get tangled easily 
Pretty good but don't expect perfection 
Very short and can easily be made cheaper 
Not impressive but its okay 
Not for Bottles or Sippy Cups 
Renaming as Secure SOME Toys. 
Better for lighter toys than sippy cups! 
Useful 
Does the job - Could be better 
Found it for half the price at Babies R Us! 
Got the wrong color puke green 
should be bigger should be able to stay seated on seat 
Could be better.. 
Good for a laugh! 
Kind of a Waste of Money 
REALLY plush (almost too much?) 
Good idea but didn't work for us. 
A bit heavy for travel 
Not a miracle bottle 
Good Bottles 
Okay but like Dr. Browns Wide better 
I don't see how this is better than my Avents 
for the price they shouldn't leak 
Baby seems to like them... 
Baby Bottles 
Okay 
Amazing bottles stupid size 
I love it but has serious safety issues. 
horrible smell from paint 
Not Great Not Awesome...Just Okay 
Trying cloth 
Great for newborn and not-yet-mobile babies 
They're OK but make sure your diapers are gauzy enough to snag. 
They don't work on receiving blankets. 
Good but do not love 
Just start with size 2 (toddler size) 
Works as expected 
Most features are great unfortunately one huge con... 
Assembly is a pain! 
NOT for the Uppababy Vista! 
It's just OK 
It works fine but the sheet is not included 
Like it....not love 
Still needs airing due to VOC's 
OK; leaks after 2 uses 
not for an active toddler 
Noisy a bit 
Good Travel Bed for Toddlers May Need Re-Inflating 
Love the Chair but.... 
Good deal for the price considering the other options... 
It works 
Nice but a bit big 
breast milk storage containers are too small. 
feeding set 
Storage bottles are the best part of this set 
Great for milk storage not for the bottles 
Great transition spout. 
Okay for a girl. 
Cute but not very inclusive of 1st year milestones 
useful but bland 
Not the drop in liners my fault for not reading description closely 
I prefer the dop in liners 
Really hard to open 
Won't buy it. 
not really a nursing pillow 
Too firm for me 
A fail in our house! 
not as good as others 
was ok 
leaky but good price 
Like the Bottles. Dislike the Nipples 
great bottle but.... 
So heavy 
These don't come with a sealing disc 
I wanted so bad to love these 
bought because of plastic scare 
Love that these are glass at a great price 
Pricey but worth the money if it gets you inspired to organize 
wish it was bigger 
pricey 
Useful but overpriced 
Good sippy cup 
one of the better sippy cups 
Decent but not for my daughter! 
soft tip and handles would be great! 
Easy to use but not great for little little ones. 
Not quite what we expected 
Difficult assembly broken parts...but once complete pretty nice 
Could be better 
Beautiful but... 
Eh 
Works ok but a little quirky 
Good monitor but definitely not interference-free 
Nice but had some quality issues 
baby monitor 
It's ok not great 
Good but could be great 
I Would NOT Recommend This For New Parents... 
(2.5 stars) Some good ideas but didn't work well in practice overall 
Did not fasten securely in my car 
Great safety impractical for cleaning 
Fun flash cards sharp edges. 
Cards hard to flip 
Spanish seemed to be an afterthought 
good buy for the money 
Wish it didn't come in 2 languages 
Poorly chosen pictures 
Love Hate this stroller 
You Get What You Pay For 
Has issues 
Good design but doesn't always work... 
not the miracle I'd hoped for 
Not used much 
Eh. 
Pacifier 
Not exactly spill proof 
It's ok 
Eh ok 
Way too soft 
Firm but sags after use 
maybe for someone else 
Great while it lasted. 
The Isis Duo is better 
I'm torn on this product 
Its just ok... 
Three quarters thumbs up... 
Cute but 
Possibly more cute than fun 
Not Steady Enough 
Cute But My Child Doesn't Like These 
Very squishy 
I want to like it so much but... 
works well when it works... 
I hated this 
As Expected but Difficult to Use 
Don't buy these honey-colored PES Avent bottles; buy the cloudy PP bottles 
It leaks. 
Not hassle free 
nice 
our daughter never figured it out 
Very unusual nipple 
Good idea but not the best execution... 
Good product for breast feeding moms 
Good for some babies just not ours 
Leak to fast 
well my son likes these but I'm not so sure. 
Not for my baby 
Just okay 
Didn't work for my baby 
Nothing too special 
Soothing but not super moist. 
Just okay 
neutral 
It works but not sure it will be a keeper... 
Could be better. 
Good bottle not for us. 
Would be great if my daughter took a bottle. 
Not Your Ideal Bottle 
Try and try again 
Not a winner for us. 
Recommended by our lactation consultant but my son doesn't like it 
It looks nice

It's alright 
Baby didn't like 
The do have a funky taste 
Great Idea But Not Our Favorite

Small 
ideal. 
Waste 
Good for a diaper bag 
Not so great 
educate yourself on them before using one of it can cause weight problems for your baby 
Great if you know how to use it 
A syringe and feeding tube worked better for us 
Ok 
Not a fan 
Could be better 
Falls off wall 
Cute but they don't stick 
Took me a while to get it to work correctly 
Pretty nice.  Works just fine.  Could use 2 improvements. 
Does the job. 
Better than most but not great 
Tough to handle 
Owned it for a year 
Ok but could be better.

Wish I'd gotten a lighter carseat 
Good but not great 
Not loud enough 
Trouble when it's on battery 
Why can't I get it any louder?

Good little product but doesn't work for us 
Too bright at night 
Way Too Quiet 
As expected 
The blue light is a little bright

Prefer Other Products 
Noisy. 
Nice But Not the Best 
Not bad for the price 
Ok potty but seems a bit awkward for smaller toddlers 
May work for early training.... 
It does what you need it too 
Like the simplicity but too big of a straddle. 
No luck yet 
Ok 
It's REALLY cute but my daughter who is 33.5\ tall has difficulty sitting on this. 
Needs design improvements; forces child to straddle \eyes\ 
Not great... 
Was working at first 
It goes off by itself! 
Needs to be taller 
Adorable but too short 
I prefer the Rainforest Jumper 
Awesome mobile horrible battery life 
big design FLAW 
Nice mobile 
Ok but has issues 
Great Mobile but NOT worth the price!!!! 
so far so good 
When it works 
Turns on and off and parts drop off 
No silent option 
Functional but limited 
Difficult to fit to sleigh type crib rails and can damage the crib rails 
Good Product But Needs Some Improvement 
Battery hog that needs engineering refinement

Small cheap carrier 
Useful not very practical or comfortable. 
ExerSaucer is OK 
Love the saucer hate the standing stage 
We like it but watch out.......

okay on floor and as seat bad for tall kids worthless as free-standing table 
Doesn't work in \S\ shape for standing babies Falls over. Dinosaur goes off too easy. 
It is nice but our little one likes the jumperoo better 
Not great for younger babies - not enough to do.  3 n'1 Feature is very clever!!

Fun but Flawed 
Eh its ok for the price.. 
Almost perfect 
Not a fan of this style

Not as durable as some 
VERY NOISY but the baby loves it!

not impressed 
Leak and Mold 
Ugly but good price 
Good option for Ameda 
Only slightly better than nothing at all

Not so good for custom fit 
Improved the fit of the pump but sacrificed some suction 
Average 
Returned for Something Else 
Works well 
Did the job 
Fun to play with but don't work in theory 
Both pleased and disappointed 
It's okay 
just ok 
cute but suction isn't that strong 
might not work well for all car seats 
Great but... 
Great unti it broke! 
Cute idea poor execution 
It works MOST of the time 
Night lights might cause nearsightedness 
Good Concept Bad Design 
different kids like different things so i'll just do a design analysis 
Cute long battery life 
No more Velcro. 
fit was kind of funky` 
Great- if they stay on 
Velcro is easy but doesn't last 
ok but prefer other brands because of leakage 
The velcro is what kills it 
They are okay 
They do the job they just don't look cute doing it. 
It's OK... not great. 
Okay 
Needs better velcro 
Ok if you're looking for velcro 
Not the best product available 
Works well but retains smell 
Lightweight Cover For Smaller Babies 
Decent seal not a fan of velcro closure 
Good but too big 
not what I expected 
I don't understand what the big deal is with this chair...expensive for what it does

Monkey Hamper 
Sticks Well 
Doesn't stick to the table too well 
It's okay 
Suction isnt strong 
Entertaining but suction is bad and toy is removable from base 
suctions great but removed from base too easily 
Great idea bad suction. 
Not easy to clean and doesn't stay suctioned to tray 
The whole point was to have it stay in place! 
Fun toy and then there is the suction cup ... 
Baby likes 
Just good let me explain why 
Big and Smelly 
Great idea but flimsy. 
Very useful but not very durable. 
Needs to be Bigger

Okay 
Seems fine but I don't use it 
Beautiful Highchair for (Small) Babies 
A little too thin 
more hassle 
Thin plastic like a stroller rain cover 
Works well not easy to store. 
Cheap material but it works fine on carpet 
this is a round piece of see through plastic and it looks cheap on the floor 
Good size and love non-color 
Not what I ordered but will do the job. 
Nothing fancy 
Strong smell 
It doesn't suck and that's the problem 
My son has fun but it doesn't stick 
just okay 
Ok 
Worked as it should

Fits only standard toilets. 
Good disposable cups.  Hole is too small. 
Too hard to drink from 
Can get clogged 
Great to have the screw on lid 
no different from my other bottles 
Liner is pointless changing pad is great 
Yellow Pad is really \Cornmeal\ 
Don't really need it 
Just OK. 
Ok but I wish they had a waterproof layer 
glorified washcloth 
Cute but not what I was hoping for.. 
So So 
Good quality 
Great product not enough sticky tape 
Requires better adhesive 
Functional but not very sightly. 
Just OK 
Great pad... 
doesnt stick very well.. 
Cute but size didn't fit my need 
No Stickers! 
Way overpriced! 
Ok but hard to keep all the straps clean 
Great brush AWFUL soap dispenser! 
Not 100% cotton 
Okay playard sheet 
Nice sheets but shrank on first washing 
Just barely fits my pack-n-play 
Very nice 
A little snug. 
A little big 
Good quality 
Nice organic product drab organic color. 
tight on pack n play 
Too soft 
OK 
It can be improved 
Edges curl after wash surface stays damp... 
NON- ORGANIC polyester layers small in width but good for mini bed 
Nice but shrinks 
Edges curl after wash surface stays damp... 
Beware they aren't white and they shrink... 
Organic... but made in China? 
Not 100% Cotton 
Very small 
Should be called the 1/4 sheet saver 
great other than the pillowcase 
Good size pillow but need a way to close the silky pillowcase 
Nice size but you can't wash it 
This is a super small pillow! 
More like a pillow for dolls... 
Great pillow but the case slips off too easily 
Tiny pillow even for a tot! 
Not a game changer 
runs big 
frustrating 
High quality padding could stay in place better and be easier to use with buckles 
okay for the money 
Super Cute 
Cute but came broken 
what we expected 
Cute but overpriced 
Doesn't really glow 
Not as Good as the Other Avent Pacifiers 
Love Avent pacifiers but the night time one does not retain its glow at all 
Backfired 
Great Avent pacifier horrible \glow\ pacifier 
Too long 
Avent Freeflow Paci 
Frustrated 
Every  baby is different! This may or may not be the right one!! 
Pacis yes!  Styles boo. 
Great size suction cups do not stick 
White not Blue 
served my purpose but may not be functional for most 
Received a different color than pictured 
handy 
Its ok...but not for sticking on the wall 
OK. Wrong color? 
doesn't stick to the wall that well 
Doesn't suction 
We made it work for us. 
Good holder doesn't stick to porcelain tile 
Doesn't hold great 
Have to Use Other Suction Cups 
Suction cups are a nightmare 
It's alright 
fits many toys but 
Good product but.. 
Beware not made in USA 
Good for colic but they leak 
Not bad... 
Okay bottle many parts and big for little hands to hold 
These Leak 
Infant didn't prefer this type of bottle 
Won't buy again 
Great venting system but plastic scratches and extra work to clean 
Smooth flow but... 
Good bottle but slow slow flow 
not natural nipple-like 
Ended up being our least favorite bottles. 
baby does seem to eat more 
wide neck has been a drawback 
just okay 
Not the best for this price range 
Not for everyone 
I suppose I'll keep it 
It is Ok not as nice as I hoped 
Still like it but not as great as I first thought. 
Pretty and functional but won't last 
Review of purchase through Target only 
Not large enough & straps too short 
Love the design but falling apart at the seams! 
Fashionable with tons of storage compartments 
It's cute but wipe drys out 
Not very useful... 
Dries wipes!! :( 
Funny red slide 
Functional 
Red wipes door slides open... 
You get what you pay for 
This is on ok wipe holder 
Dry wipes 
It's cute but... 
ok 
Design I like 
Really thin 
Nothing special 
Different from picture 
Fits wide range of strollers but extra strap loops annoying 
Never got to use it like I wanted to 
Poor magnetic closure 
Not the best with the City Select stroller 
Good product. 
works OK 
Not good but not bad either 
does it's basic job but not thrilled with how it attaches. 
Purchased as a replacement 
Returned it 
Areas for improvement. 
Looks nice/ very warm/ but zippers too close to eyes. 
Great warm cover for Chicco Keyfit 30 but works best for smaller babies 
For small babies 
this will do the trick 
great device but cleanup can be tedious 
Nice but not necessary 
Never used 
Please taste the water after it went through a  cooking cycle. 
So very close but not quite there 
Very easy to use but there is no sound indicator. Unsightly stains :( 
Expensive for what it is 
Not for Outdoor 
Almost a homerun 
Small but nice 
Great concept toddler didn't care for it 
It's OK 
Just OK for 2 year molars 
Such a weird design...still uncertain 
Ehhh he could take it or leave it mostly leave it 
Son won't use it 
It's okay 
My son didn't take to it 
Good idea but baby not Interested 
Great idea but baby did not go for it 
Good suction too many parts great short-term solution. 
For the price not bad. 
Not bad for the price 
Splurge and get yourself something better. 
this product works if you dont have the money 
Ehh.. it's okay 
worked once 
upset 
It's fine. 
its a good product but i wanted it to fit in my ... 
Great while it lasted 
Decent quality but much too short in length 
Too big. 
Protects the corners but sags at the sides. 
not great 
matching blanket 
Nice for a small pillow 
Slightly disappointed 
Good bedrail. 
Very cool feature; some glitches 
Great monitor but... 
Expensive and Lackluster 
Decent Gate 
Not asymmetrical - didn't work for us 
good gate but misleading description 
Not incredibly sturdy 
Good but... 
It did the job but barely 
Eh not a big hit 
Smells good and soft on babys gums 
They're okay. 
Small and easy to hold 
Expected much more from Vulli products 
Not interested 
Good for the money 
Fits Great but really hard 
good for swimming 
Sizing seemed a little off 
Good for home use only 
Nice 
Nice product but too small for me. 
Cute and functional! 
Stain Easily 
babykicks 
great wipes but the tag is annoying 
soft and comfy but leak through when used over night 
ok for use at home 
Pretty good 
okay but prefer their 'fleece' ones 
They work but I've used better 
Absorbent but don't use Snappi fasteners! 
absorbent but not for small newborns 
Good and bad 
Really expensive.... we ended up using them sparingly 
good prefolds but don't work well with the snappis 
Absorbent but they shrink. 
absorbent but shrink 
I dont know 
Take em or leave em 
Doesn't hold much liquid 
Not Sure What I'm Doing Wrong 
Too wide for baby. 
These work..but they are very bulky 
Works well but leaves lint 
Fantastic for 2 years 
Updating from 5 to 3 stars - 2 main issues... 
Good but will interfere with Wi-Fi 
Monitor fine but Wi-Fi interference is a deal killer 
Not quite as plush as i thought... 
Bumper not as pictured :( 
Good 
Ok 
Not a fan 
happiness that was short lived 
Tray useless seat is ok 
My baby loves it but can't stay in it for too long 
Not so great 
what one child loves.. 
Not that bad 
it's OK but i returned it 
Super Seat 
Better than Bumbo 
the tray isn't too stable 
Good seat 
Summer Infant vs Bumbo 
Great as a chair for babies learned to sit up 
It's okay. 
A little disappointing 
Meh. It's ok 
good for the price 
Works but can be Dangerous 
Pricey not perfect but gets the job done. 
Wary of smell 
Liked these but found others I like better...... 
Good product but make sure it fits your bed 
Shrunk when I washed it 
Barely Gets the Job Done... 
Nice big bag but flimsy hardware 
Not as nice as expected 
Okay slipcover 
Works just fine 
Not very soft 
Nice cover right price wrong pattern 
Rough Thin Synthetic Fabric 
Not soft! 
Rougher fabric 
Not very soft 
Boppy cover 
It's simple and pink 
It's kinda scratchy. 
nice colors thin cover 
Not great! 
Cute not soft 
Doesn't help fix flat head just prevents it. 
much smaller than I thought 
Perhaps it depends on the baby but mine would fuss the moment I laid her on this... 
It's okay but recommend Mimos pillow 
So Far So Good 
My baby didn't like it 
Cannot be used for elder baby who moves a lot 
Don't want to give a star rating but... 
I use this pilllow every day but baby still has a flat head 
It's ok 
Great but not for carseat?? 
It's alright... 
smaller than anticipated 
Super small and uncomfortable 
Not sure if it is working.... 
Good product but make sure it is what you are looking for. 
I expected more!! 
Recommend for smaller heads 
HORRIBLE NIPPLE 
Too complicated 
why no replacement straws? 
not a cup for promoting independence 
Why doesn't Amazon let me specify a color? 
Definitely NOT the best 
Great sippy cups but read fine print. 
Too short. 
Maybe not for infant seats? 
Returned 
Too small 
Item Not The Same As Pictured Or Described 
Cute doesn't get a lot of use 
Ok not perfect 
it is probably a great product for most spaces 
Two stars off: advertised age specs are rubbish. 
Does what it needs to do 
A couple of minor issues... 
Works but small opening 
Gaps 
Eh 
Decent product 
not ideal 
Didn't work for us 
To the toddler Gandalf says \You shall not pass!\ 
Description is a little misleading 
Does NOT fit openings up to 40\. 
Decent for the price 
It's OK... 
Measure right... the gate is smaller than you think 
It's okay 
Nice 
Works great in narrow spaces with young children. 
Babies can open the gate! 
Didn't fit our space 
Not all that great. 
Decent for the price 
Not one-handed. 
Great price will do the job 
Serves its purpose 
Go with North States Supergate instead 
Great in theory 
works 
Got this to replace one I used for 1 year 
Decent gate. 
Its ok 
Just Okay... 
Alright but not Hard for Toddler to Learn to Open. 
Easy to install and use even for a two year old 
Does the job. 
Did an okay job 
Good but only good for narrow space 
Not great but not terrible 
Not bad if you get a good price 
Maybe ok for animals not that great for kids not necessarily pressure mounted 
Kind of short for a \super wide\ 
Cheap but Effective 
Great Latch Pressure mount could use work 
Does the job but could be more sturdy 
5 Stars for function minus 2 for a safety concern 
Serves it's purpose. 
Flimsy but works. 
Good cheap gate for a NON BUSY part of the house 
Great if narrow 
cheaply made missing pieces but easy to install 
It's Okay 
not for us 
you get what you pay for 
Just okay 
Ok but not great 
Does not very well. 
Its a bit flimsy but it serves its purpose 
Though it fit it was too stretched to be functional. 
A good option for those with pets 
Not my favorite 
Fine for certain situations 
Cute but some flaws 
Bought twice for both my kids more expensive second time 
My son likes it 
still needs some tweaking 
Simple Car Mirror 
This thing is ok but I wouldn't buy it again 
Great to Have But Doesn't Fit All High Chairs 
Gets the job done 
Covers the high chair. May not work with seat belts 
gets the job done 
Just okay 
Mat is small 
Just \alright\ 
Hot material 
BULKY HEAVY HOT POOR INSTRUCTIONS 
LOVE only for carrying a car seat -NOT FOR LATER USE 
Great and not great... 
Generally a good system if you don't use mass transit 
Mixed feelings about this stroller 
This stroller is okay 
Nice stroller don't leave it in the car. 
a little disappointed 
A little costly but the product itself is ok 
I could select just one color 
Works well but has drawbacks 
It isn't the best choice. 
First one: DAMAGED; Second one: a KEEER! 
Cherry color expect it to arrive damaged 
Nice crib but arrives with some damage 
Pictures a bit deceptive 
Awkwrad Height 
Good idea but I don't use it much. 
So far so good 
Great in Theory - I just hope it's working! 
Not Worth the Worry? 
I think it works? 
Not sure it's working 
Flimsy small and functionally suspect. 
Goes through batteries quick no way to verify 
Cute but not the most popular shower gift 
Clever but other products are cheaper 
A handly little sterilizer for the germ-phobic 
Battery Gobbler 
Not good for boys might work for girls. 
OK but has some issues. 
love the idea but 
works 
Use this if you don't need in the cabinet 
Keeps everyone out! 
Not a Fan 
Waterproof but still leak through to clothes 
Get the car seat cover instead! 
Washed and ripped 
nice product but prefer the heavier weight bundle me. 
Baby still cries 
Tried on my toddler but he hates it 
It works okay my kid still hates it. 
Eh It's ok 
Ehh 
aspirator 
im 50/50 
didn't work for us 
Just Okay 
Hmmm? 
Works ok but try the Zo-Li On-The-Go Travel Formula & Snack Dispenser instead. 
Somewhat flimsy 
Nice try but... 
Not bad for our toddler boy 
it is average 
Hard to use. 
A mixed bag. 
Both Good and Bad 
one leaked but the brand is good 
Not good for all babies 
I want to love this bottle but it has a major flaw. 
Not as great as I had hoped 
Still too fast a flow nipple 
Good idea but these are leaky 
Not As Great As I Hoped 
Helped with tummy time... a little 
My baby didn't take to it 
Noise Bomb 
Son likes toy better than me 
So-so 
Cute idea but kind of hard to squeeze 
It is too hard for a baby to squeeze. 
Kind of works for a 2 year old 
Haven't found anything like it! 
great use but not for their purpose 
Looks great not as functional as it could be 
pretty good 
Wheels don't work on carpet. 
Great until they start getting around 
Lacks Medium Flow Nipples 
Not as modest as I thought 
Baby still gets hot underneath 
Nice cover but hard to get on 
Get the latest cover instead 
Does its Job 
Snoogle Cover 
Seems ok 
Didn't do what I hoped but not bad 
Handy for travel but a hassle long-term 
bottles great liners suck 
Decent product but didn't like it enough to switch. 
I didn't notice a difference 
No air but still messy. 
Happy with the bottles but I did not get the bottles that are pictured. 
It's OK but would Supplement for gift 
Great for travel 
Sticking with Playtex non-drop ins ! 
Whatever you do DON'T BOIL 
Went back to regular bottles 
Nice Little Gift Idea 
These work great but be careful about temperature 
Decent Bottle Set 
To much for replacements 
Useful? For some people. Premium? Not so much. 
nice idea 
Lid isn't great 
Needs a better design 
Cute stickers but doesn't sticks very well 
Great design but very weak adhesive 
heavy toys pull off wall 
shape becomes distorted and as a result it will no longer stay suctioned 
Doesn't Stick 
Suction cups don't work in our bath 
Doesn't hold up after washing 
Grows mold! 
it's ok but it's the only travel wipe warmer I could find. 
Works great but only if plugged in 
Loved it in the beginning 
Came apart quickly 
Travel wipes warmer 
Great concept...cheap product 
A little too bulky for diaper bag. 
Thought this was an unnecessary luxury. I was WRONG. Great customer service. 
I'll take the good with the bad 
Keeps wipes warm is too bright 
it's ok 
A little damaged 
love and hate 
a luxury 
Good wipes warmer but cord broke after a year of use. 
Good but... 
Nice if it works 
Wish I had gotten colors 
Great concept not as visually stimulating 
Has some unknown sealant over the wood; baby never looks or touches it 
Baby doesn't care for it 
Not the Best Rattle Out 
Just ok ball 
Okay Ball 
Good concept but doesn't work well 
It doesn't suck it sucks 
Ok Product 
My baby not a fan 
Cute but not comfortable for me or baby 
Good but could use work 
Cute. 
2 Year old's favorite. 
Leak Proof but hard to clean 
Good concept but not has so many flaws 
OK But these Leak Easily 
It really depends on what you are looking for 
Adorable but VERY CHEAP design 
Flimsy but does the job 
Way Cute Way Expensive 
Not very useful but ever so cute 
Guard is great adhesive is horrible 
Great looking. Not very useful 
One serious design flaw when folding the G stroller with panniers attached and \closed\. 
ok 
Fall apart easily. 
Fragile but not impossible 
My son loves it I love it but be warned for the quality! 
Awesome... Till it broke 
Great Until It Died!  Now No Longer Available From Manufacturer! 
Fun but broke fast 
Best Bath Toy So Far! (UPDATE: oops......it broke) 
Tons of fun but sucks up batteries 
Fun toy for bath time 
Fun product - jury is out on quality... 
My son loves this! 
Cute Product- Impossible Packaging 
Protect furniture from leaks! 
Not Great for Cloth Wipes 
General review for wipe warmers 
Musty sometimes but still a good warmer. 
Heating part stopped working after 9 months 
Worked Fine but Never Used It 
Worked great until it stopped working 
Decent for a second carseat 
Safe seat compact size fun colors but difficult to use 
very cute but not of much interest to my 6 month old 
Weak Bell 
its okay but cheaper out there... 
Average 
Alright 
This is way too big for a first snack cup 
Very large opening is a stretchy fabric material 
Nice but too big 
Snack trap vs Munchie Mug 
meh.. 
Cute Idea - But! 
Not worth the price 
oversized... 
Loved it initially but it's going on the shelf until they're a little older 
Great if you like the padded shoulder 
good Product 
still learning 
Too hard to get the hang of for my taste... 
Not For Me 
Hmm 
It's ok 
This works for what I needed. 
Very cute but not too spill proof 
Not for me... 
Useful 
It's OK 
Okay but annoyingly long 
Adequate protection 
Isn't smoke colored it's clear 
It guards the stove but I have other issues with it 
Too rough! 
Just OK... 
Good that it is organic but very thin 
NOT SURE IT IS WORTH THE MONEY 
It works 
ehhh 
keeps kid safe...but hard to open 
Would not lay flat against the wall 
Its ok but the latch piece is inadequate 
Not bad 
Bulky and kind of low quality 
Best product I've found but not perfect 
Great...but 
Great while it lasted 
great idea 
Way bigger than it appeared 
Worth it if you need an extra once or two 
Good idea... 
Give it a few weeks to see if you really need it 
Huge! 
Good idea steep price 
Serves its purpose 
Ok if you really need it 
Not that useful as an exclusive pumper 
Good idea but kind of useless after the first weeks 
Great product but didnt really entertain my daughter 
Eh... 
Holds up for about 2 months 
Very nice material.  Zipper needs improvement though. 
Nice product but better to choose other prints. 
Great material fit not so great 
It tears but still works 
it's pretty but.... 
Only one packet - WAY OVERPRICED 
Still on the fence 
Ok wrap just never took to it 
Not for me 
Im sure this works for some 
Not for forward facing 
Not as functional as the other style 
Lid should come off 
so so 
depends on what you use it for 
Wish I'd Spent More 
Just OK and stopped working for a short while. 
Too many issues 
Very good if.... 
Not what I needed but very good product nonetheless 
Cost doesn't outweigh the benefits 
Enormous 
Boon saucer - works fine as a divider plate doesn't prevent baby from picking up 
Too small 
Slip-resistant but NOT flip-resistant 
What I need but not the best quality 
Good but smaller than BG 4.0 
I only use it when I run out of all my other diapers 
Could be better 
Good as occasional seat not great for twins 
it would outgrow 
Sort of meh but it works. 
useable 
slides around on table never used strap but sturdy and worked well enough 
It works... 
Look for another changing table pad 
Made in China - but serves it's purpose ;-) 
Summer Infant Changing Pad 
*REALLY* tight fit for the IKEA Sundvik changing table 
May not fit your changing table 
Good changing pad for a long time 
You get what you pay for. 
No necessary. 
Decent product but too big 
. 
love the belt 
Good enough for me 
Be Prepared to Need to Off-Gas This Thing 
It does what it supposed to do 
Good size and does the job should be cheaper 
Smells 
This thing is HUGE 
It's large! 
Smells awful 
Hard to clean... Don't use without a cover. 
Functional and easy to clean - installation is silly 
A little awkward 
Um it's ok 
Durable and cute but... 
Bendy Ball 
Uninterested 
Great ball but poorly named 
Baby doesn't like this toy 
okay 
Maybe Better for Younger Babies 
Not the same toy now than what I bought in 2009 
Too heavy 
It is well Made 
More suitable for older babies 
it's ok 
Never really held interest 
It's OKAY 
good and bad 
Good product 
average quality item 
cute.. maybe cuter for me than the baby 
Pretty good 
Disappointing for Baby Einsten 
Smaller than expected. . . but it's a bendy ball 
My nine months old enjoyed it for one minute really 
Very cute... but my 6 month old didn't care. 
Its ok 
Hard 
OK 
SO SO 
Not Very Bendy. 
Durable fun ball for baby! 
Interest level will very depending on baby 
Mediocre 
My daughter doesn't enjoy this as much as I had hoped 
Don't hate..but don't love it. 
Hazardous but my son loves it... 
eh it's okay. 
Small but cute 
nothing amazing... but maybe I'll appreciate it more when he gets a little older 
it's okay 
I don't see whats so great about this thing 
Its okay. 
I recommend a round regular ball. 
pretty good 
For a little extra room. 
Basic net... 
It's Okay 
Cute But not high quality 
hard to transition 
Can't Choose Color Baby Not A Fan 
... exactly what i was looking for but theyre not bad did get a girly color even though i ... 
okay... 
Awesome cups Anoying you can't choose colors. 
Good size for small hands but terrible spout 
Lid hard to line up 
Great cup 
Generic packaging 
Packaging is suspicious 
Broke after 3 months of use 
Slightly reduced power but works 
This is an OEM product 
It works 
Didn't specify voltage 
Stopped working after about 4 months. 
Great Price 
Packaging or product arrived with a strong floral scent 
Yes they do what they say but good luck getting them on 
Twin Mom in VA 
Great Idea but really hard to suck milk through 
Love the idea... 
Neat idea but hard to use 
Didn't work as expected 
not absorbant 
Decent Item - Nothing Amazing 
\Plush\ eh? 
Just ok.. 
Just okay 
Easy to pinch thighs in buckle 
Cute but not so sturdy secure 
Daughter never used it. 
Very Big 
Ouch 
no slip grip that bums me out 
My son loves Mickey so he wants to use the ... 
cute.. but only for 1 meal option 
No instruction sheet pilled after one wash! 
Great for Newborns Not for Bigger Babies 
Not the size depicted but can be pumped up 
Cute but not great 
Easy to keep clean 
Sort of does the job 
Trouble fitting on our older faucet 
Looks cute but.. 
Didn't really work 
Cool spout cover... but... 
Works fine but gets moldy! 
Will not work without a diverter!! 
Just OK 
Does The Trick 
Only stays on with shower pull! 
suitable for avoiding possible nasty collisions 
Three Stars 
Pretty Good but... 
Wanted to love it just doesn't work for us. 
Good idea doesn't work on my tub 
Doesn't stay on but is very cute 
Sort of what I needed 
1 year old can easily remove from spout 
Cover works but duck has hard protruding beak 
Fits loose on my spout... 
Cute but cheap 
Very cute 
It's ok 
Not good with short spouts 
Pricey for what it is 
Great if it fits right. Clearly not a one size fits all! 
Doesn't really work on extremely narrow spouts 
It works 
Why can't we choose our own colors? 
I'm torn.... 
Don't see (feel?) much difference 
Good if you have large nipples 
Wish they were softer 
Didn't work for me but the product is solid 
Great concept - very uncomfortable though. 
Didn't find them comfortable 
OK to help with pain from contact but not very practical 
Nothing Special 
Small hole 
Medela SoftShells Breast Shells For Sore or Inverted Nipples 
No thanks 
Works but troublesome 
Good bottles but leak 
Love the look 
Good if they help your baby with spitup/gas otherwise just a lot of extra cleaning 
Not the best out there for all colic cases. 
Great bottle- A lot of Parts 
ok 
i guess it's ok 
Rainbow mats are nice-but possible over-priced due to thickness 
Does the job but needs some fiddling 
Short 
Not as protective as I'd hoped 
Not bad but hard to fit 
Quality control 
3.5 stars 
Does Its Job But Smells Terrible 
if you can spare the money but not necessary. 
Does the job 
Very large! 
Covers rail but does not cushion 
Thin covering smelled for days 
over priced but it works 
Manufacturer Description??? 
The price is great! The size is not. 
another suboptimal solution 
They break 
it's good BUT 
Whether it works for you really depends on your breast/nipple type 
Dimensions provided are for the inner tube not the cup 
Picture is misleading but works alright. 
Low price = Low Quality Thirsties are better 
Ok 
An okay toy with not much to it. 
TImer is WAYYY too short 
Baby likes it but I don't 
Eh... 
good bowl but still made in China. 
Not bad for a door knob lock 
Worked for 6 months 
Varies By Door Knob Size/Shape 
Very comfortable not really absorbant 
Seems like a good idea... 
Not impressed so far with leashing my twins. 
and is said i would never use a harness... 
Just ok for my 18-month 
a little too small 
Replacing this before 7 months 
Non-Skid? 
Received Damaged Product Twice 
Change tables are good but this is basic 
Started out great... then not so much.. 
Good product 
Worked the purpose 
Very Cute But Buttons Kept Coming Undone 
Nto crazy about it 
ripped after two washes 
Not soft 
Ok sheets 
Good enough for Grandma's house 
Endlessly useful 
Great but not needed 
Leaks.... 
1 year old dislikes it but it is a great cup from my perspective 
Just okay 
Not easy to use 
5 stars for no-spill 1 star for shape 
too bulky 
Just Okay 
I know this is politically incorrect...... 
Bottom of cup too big for average cup holders 
but I do like the flexibility of the hanger 
INEXPENSIVE BUT RECOMMEND BUILTNY CASE 
Hard to open 
Ok 
Just ok... 
Definitely not for two pacifiers 
A little smaller than expected. 
Ok 
great plate with one major design flaw... 
Kind of small 
Great concept not for every baby 
crappy lid 
Nice and easy 
Gets the job done but not a good value 
OK but there are other less expensive options 
Works well but I've found a small conatiner that I like better... 
Wanted this to work 
Just alright 
Very soft sounds 
Fair buy. 
Very quiet 
Not loving it 
Step up from Graco but not sure it's \the one\ 
Didn't Work for Us 
Great idea but my daughter didn't think so 
I really wanted to love it&#8230; 
Woombie Swaddler

Cute Tote for Baby 
Hard to manually express/compress in this bra 
not for me 
Works well enough but don't love 
Nice to have but not necessary 
feels like the pumps will fall off (but they never have) 
Wasn't very comfortable for me but quality material. 
for my wife 
Good but you dont need it. 
size large is HUGE 
Just okay - not tight enough 
Doesn't really act as a bra but does hold the flanges in place (36DDD wearing L/XL/XXL) 
Does not hold well once you have some weight to those bottles 
You really don't need it. 
Good if you need it 
Returned it 
Difficult to take on and off 
more trouble than it is worth for me 
Does the job but not as useful as I hoped. 
works well not flawless 
holds flanges on by pressing against chest 
Dont waste your $$$ 
No lo necesitas realmente... 
It's just ok

They're OK but Wishing I Got Something Else 
inexpensive- but doesn't last long 
Good but too small 
Draw string issues 
talk about large try 8x12 in. (piece of paper size)....what is small or medium 
Perfect as the \just I case bag\ for the diaper bag 
Good For Occasional Use 
Fine except for drawstrings 
They work 
Work well at first but don't wear well over time 
Just OK 
They are not my favorite 
What's in a wet bag? 
My son Loves it 
Good toy would like to be able to use music w/out the motion and vice-versa 
Fairly good entertainment for young babies annoying music 
Not sure about the spinning motion 
Seemed like a great idea but son wouldn't use them 
Beautiful product but he didn't like them 
Awkward angle 
Smaller than expected but seems to work. 
Seems to have an odd fit. Doesn't really wrap ... 
Works but kinda thin.

Pretty and compact design but difficult to turn 
Mostly perfect. 
Will NOT fit (3) Avent Natural bottles... 
Perfect for bottles but nothing else 
Doesn't fit 3 Playtex Nurser Drop-Ins 
Nice until you get a hole in the ice pack 
Cooler for EBM

OK be ready for the light rattling 
sunlight is bad for retaining straps 
I love Munchkin products 
Its okay 
Needs some modifications to be great... 
NOT Made in USA 
It is pretty. 
Next time I'd get one with drawers 
Can't expect too much in terms of quality for this price. 
Looks beautiful but the drawers don't open very far 
Decent quality but not all solid wood 
drawers don't pull out far enough 
I thought this would be the one... Nope! 
Love the concept wish it was better quality material! 
Not good for babies under 1 year 
Major Cuteness Factor & Somewhat Decent Quality 
Well-made and stylish...but small. 
Its decent

So-So 
Not for kids under 3 years old! 
Decent for the price. 
Good Overall but Small 
a little small for kids 
They do the job 
Some mats only had 3 sticky sides! Argh!

Darker Color 
Modern and Clean 
Looks nice but pretty flimsy 
Prefer to spend the money on boon 
Soft and small for baby but not great. 
Needs better fastner 
Wanted to like it. 
Perfect for spoon-fed babies. Nightmare for self-feeders 
Island highchair- you need lots of space 
I wish this would have worked on an island 
It definitely has its pros and cons. 
Bummed Out 
Good seat but there are better options 
Wanted to love it but it has a few design flaws 
Won't be reaching for these... 
Alot to wash doesnt do much for keeping out the air 
was great at first now not so great. 
Great design but not for everyone 
Really wanted to love it but couldn't and neither did baby 
Save your money 
A+ customer service 
good idea average result 
I loved the MamaRoo; but my baby didn't... 
Had high hopes... 
Great Product Not for my baby 
Good but expensive for long term use 
Seems a waste 
We didn't use the extra filters yet 
Cute backpack useless \leash\ 
Good buy

Heavy - better on its own than in a bag 
Child's legs get stuck in the rails. 
knotted toy 
I wish my baby liked it 
Baby not interested 
Thinner than expected

Good but... 
Not my favorite but gets the job done 
Works well but expensive 
Too expensive 
Easy on 
hard to get on but once on is good 
Runs small 
Buy a size larger than fits you before baby comes! 
Go up a size from the chart

Does the job but not the most comfortable thing to put on. 
Runs small 
Nice product but it badly needs a hook at the ... 
Small and Awkward

Good product...too bad my baby is still fussy. 
Just OK 
Perfect for the money but easy to trip 
Does the Job 
Nice chair but some issues 
Not a huge fan. 
For the price I expected a little nicer quality 
Agree not so much space saving here 
It's OK. 
Rolling high chair is still the best 
great for smaller infants/toddlers 
I like it but I don't love it. 
Not for fat babies 
This is cute but has some design flaws 
I prefer a cheaper version 
Earlier version is better 
Lost that loving feeling... 
Not as good as the older style 
It's ok 
Just OK 
It's Ok... 
Gets the job done 
This cover is okay but.... 
Elastis isn't forever 
returned. 
the tip part of this paci is really big 
wish it wasn't so hard to roll out the clay 
Was somewhat disappointed 
Push Hard To Get Good Print 
Hard to make it flat 
Not really a rattle 
Mehhhhh... 
Just ok 
Ok for a starting potty 
Wish this was taller 
Good basic potty 
Small and awkward seating 
It's cute but I wouldn't buy it again 
We like it but... 
Baby likes it but it could be better 
So So Rattle 
perfect for 4m-9m 
okay but overhyped 
For older infants. 
not the best quality 
Cute but not necessary 
Doesn't fit City Select nor City Mini double 
More pain than pleasure from this lock! 
its okay 
Good for Travel but not for Daily Use 
Good idea but not executed very well - still it has its uses 
Not perfect but not bad either. 
Great idea but not great in practice. 
Try before you travel - not for younger infants 
Definitely useful in a pinch 
Good choice for an emergency kit or your car not much else 
a good idea could be better 
Good for on the go. 
With some improvements could become a 5 star product 
Concept silly & wasteful in my opinion...but product title is fitting 
Convenient? Definitely. Recyclable? Only technically. 
Just OK - I prefer others 
Super cute...a tad too small 
Not soft enough for newborns 
Nice but not exactly what I thought it would be 
Just ok. 
Decent Burp Cloths 
Good but not great 
not as big as expected but nice material 
Dr Seuss on the Loose! 
Could be cheaper 
not for my daughter but appealing 
It's OK 
neat design makes it less valuable as toothbrushing training 
It's ok. 
Not bad start for teething remedy 
Okay but a magnet for dirt 
Baby loves it but not for young babies 
My son loves this! 
Good for early teething phase 
Daughter loves it but pricey 
Collects lint very easily 
Toddler version is better 
Keeps baby dry...but could make yourself 
you can just cut up some fleece yourself 
I'll make my own in the future 
OK product horribly overpriced 
Great idea but better to 'make' your own 
They work but they're thin. Not my favorite cloth diapering item. 
Helps with irritation 
Make your own & save money 
My baby didn't like it 
Not what I expected 
It's great only if your baby likes it 
Not for bigger babies 
Better for front carry than back carry 
Really wanted to like it but... 
Better than tape but not perfect 
Good if you don't want to \erase\ 
Can't erase the pink one - WTF? 
Not really one-size-fits all 
Too big. 
The bands are cute but the writing washes off FAST 
Good stroller. 
*UPDATE*~*~*~PROS & CONS~I LOVE IT BUT ITS MISSING SOME MAJOR CONVENIENCES~*~*~ 
Expensive and requires you to order more hardware to adapt it to most households. 
Meets Expectations 
Beautiful changing table but far from perfect

My baby hates it 
It's alright

Not worth the price. 
Not organic safe Pla-Polylactide Fiber 
Just okay 
Best we could find but still just ok.

Not as useful as I'd thought it would be buy a Fisher Price booster instead 
just ok... 
nice but they stain 
Not really a first spoon 
soft and rather good sized 
Not very fitted 
Not very fitted 
Not actually necessary for the Pack and Play 
kind of pointless 
Stains right away 
Froggy Burpy Bib has shrunk 
Stains 
The quality of these bibs are excellent no doubt 
Not worth the money 
My third choice of towels. It's ok not the best though 
I'm disappointed in Aden + Anais 
it's okay 
Not sure why this brand is such a hit. 
great washcloth/so-so towel 
LOVE the fabric but what's with the tags? 
The wash cloths are super soft...the towel not so much

It Works 
Not as good as Nosefrida

Fell out of love after a year 
Wish the included screws fit the TV 
NOT TRULY A 3-in-1 CRIB:  BUYER BEWARE! 
It's OK... 
Works great 
Did not work so well for me. 
bottom corners at center line are firm enough to scratch 
Flimsy but cute 
They are great in that they do allow you more hands free ... 
Replaced with a zipper one 
Order size down! 
Meh... 
Cute but runs big 
Buy one size less than you think you need

Short 
Sits too low 
Lovely non-scratching design doesn't hold much. 
Great but very small 
Cool concept but too short 
Like other people say

Not for rounded crib surfaces 
Serves its purpose once you get past the smell 
Great tub - did not last as long as I would hope. 
Ok

Squirters 
Does what it's supposed to do 
Doesn't keep water out of eyes.

Ok- not that great value 
Great for short period of time 
not what I thought it was 
Wasn't as nice as I expected 
It works but pricey 
Just get the bassinet-sized pads 
Too small to actually do much 
Cute and handy! 
a bit small for diapering 
Small pads 
Should have paid more attention to the size 
These lap pads are small 
not waterproof?! 
Handy but very small 
Prefer the bigger bassinet pads but wonderful product 
Small and stiff 
Gets crushed easily 
Does the job 
Works Great but looks horrible after just 1 wash 
Too small for the bassinet cushion 
It would probably work for a bassinet 
Shrunk in the dryer 
Not thick enough! 
Just too big 
good but not my go-to 
Trial run great idea! Long term not so much. 
Ok--but pricey for how much you get 
Kissaluvs Lotion Potion 
Love the smell 
Works okay but doesn't smell the best. 
Good but a bottle can last you longer if you don't follow the directions! 
Not Sure if It's Helping 
Thick wipes for big messes (but not for delicate parts) 
No velcro closure 
Not my first choice for an overnight fitted 
It Would Be Great Except... 
wet on baby's skin 
Not bad but not great 
I like Countours 
Not the right match for my toddler 
Just ok 
Great Value / Good for light doubler protection 
Okay but I like others better 
Great bag but strap coming loose after only a few uses. 
Way too small! 
Does the job.  But also shrinks fades. 
Peace on Earth bag has no strap 
Great bag but the snap on the handle broke quickly

Disappointed 
Straw too short?!

Three Stars 
It leaks but it's still better than plastic 
dimensions mostly good 
OK pillow 
Not as soft as other package 
Disappointing as a swaddler but cute for other uses 
Soft but time intensive to swaddle 
Fabric doesn't have any give to it 
I like these but they aren't the same...

Nice size weird nipples. 
Looks better in the pictures 
It's OK 
It gets the job done...

Not what I had hoped for. 
Stains WAY too Easily 
I want to love this

Dirty laundry.

An extra half star for value for dollar ease of use and transport...but missing one valuable feature... 
Heavier than our Britax B-Agile but better steering 
Ok banana stroller 
Ho hum.

Good enough for now... 
Pretty good product. 
Not leak proof 
Average Bottle 
the cup doesnt hold much 
no cap 
Ok.... But not leak proof. Great for water! 
Wish the handles stayed put 
Leaks... 
Just OK 
Great quality but caution that it's rather heavy. 
Do not buy this in Diamond color 
Lansinoh bags are better 
Too many defective bags 
Very soft and big. 
Leaking a lot- update 
Ok bags

Works ok but not a fan 
Not what I was expecting 
Much Better 
Displeased. 
Great when used properly

Choking Hazzard... 
Didn't mind it. 
Not sure what I was expecting

Not sure 
Supervised use only 
OK PRODUCT 
It's ok. 
Watch baby while using. 
Have to be Careful 
Not too bad 
Good concept 
Baby loves them toddler chewed right through them 
not worth Monday 
Pretty good cup 
Overpriced and not nearly all we were expecting! 
After several weeks I could not recommend. 
leak 
Hard to get the top to close all the way 
These are good but leak easily if not threaded properly - WOW Cups are better 
Straw weight is great but cup leaks 
Helpful for a while but gets moldy in tiny places 
They'd be perfect if they didn't leak. 
Cool concept but they leak 
Best straw cup I have found 
Really wanted to love this. 
It's the only thing our son likes but it causes either leaks or creates such a tight seal that it's hard to sip 
Consumable and disposable; difficult to reuse 
Great cup until it rusted. 
Better than other straw cups but not that great 
it's not bad 
Great design but cheaply made especially the straw. 
okay 
not like the first couple I bought 
Good cup but may not last long 
Great but Not Perfect 
Great cup but the straws don't last 
I love it I hate it 
Ok but not worth extra cost 
straw is hard to clean 
Decent Straw Sippy Cup 
I ordered this cup for our trip to Italy. ... 
Functionality = 5 stars durability = 0 
Good concept bad design 
great concept but ours leak sometimes 
Just okay 
Better in concept than in reality 
Great first cup for 10 month old but it leaks. 
They do leak :-( 
Not a bad product just not for us. 
Could be designed better 
3.5 stars but we do like them! 
Fine but not really worth the money 
Decent placemats but not worth the premium price 
haven't used it yet. 
CUTE BUT OVERPRICED 
Not for Smart Babies 
Bye Bye Birdie 
Nice Activity Gym Some Problems 
Music toy dosen't last long! Product not really necessary...

The idea is good.... 
Okay 
Not Easy To Clean 
Good wubbanub just not my favorite. 
Great idea didn't work for us 
Just Ok 
Choose Ducky one! 
Did not receive right pacifier 
Cute but stiff 
The other shapes work better. 
Pacifier not removable. 
It's ok. 
its ok! 
Love the chic look and functionality of this stroller...but....... 
Useless on the rocker but awesome on the stroller! 
I like it! 
I enjoy it but not $900 dollars worth 
Not all natural - Polyester 
I like it just one 'small' problem... 
Absorbent but not very big 
Elastic wears quickly

The best companions to cloth diapering! - THEY CHANGED!! 
Just OK...

Not soft 
Do their job 
Three wipe showdown! 
I sort of wish my baby didn't like this 
Needs improvement 
It's okay 
Needs more bounce 
Just Ok 
Not very soothing 
Ok Bouncer...Needs Some Improvements 
Great for napping 
Cute and usefulbut not the best. 
Depend on the kid 
not for tall babies 
Not sturdy enough for little tinies 
Baby is not sure about it. 
Doesn't stay semi-reclined--falls open! 
Awkward to put baby into swing 
Nice Decoration for Living Room 
Dont skip the infant and won't work rear facing! 
Hard to clean - Headrest pad does not come off 
Pretty but loud 
Not good for large cats but works well for smaller ones... 
Okay but not for really small babies 
Not bad not great. 
Ok for the price... 
Way too reclined 
Nice but not convenient 
Kinda small 
Too small for our needs... 
good not great 
green shade has changed from earlier in the year 
Grass it hard plastic 
Works great and looks great.  But yes too small.  Here's why... 
Great for small spaces and very cute but does not fit much 
Trendy funky look - wish it was more functional 
ok product 
Small puzzle 
It's okay 
NOT a bath toy but an ok temperature tester 
Pretty good 
Meh it's okay. Single purpose use only compared to alternative 
I use this for twins 
At first it was great ... then the love disappeared 
Not what I expected 
Not made in France. 
I have a baby girl not a puppy. lol 
keeps drinks cold but too many crevices for mold to grow 
Not for boys 
Nice but the Ergo is better 
Missing Piece 
Perfectly happy not to pay over double for the Medela branded tubing! 
does the job 
Cheaply made but my 8 month old still plays with ... 
Low quality 
nice ideaneeds improvement 
Just OK 
Eh. 
OK but not great 
Warm but hard to secure 
So-so Swing 
Good buy 
Helped send baby off to dreamland 
Affordable. Compact and easy to put together. 
No variability in swing speed music is off key 
This is such a great Spacesaver!  Good Buy! 
Nice compact swing 
eh just ok 
got our baby sick 
Skip it Get the Woombie 
Okay but Frustrating! 
The type with velcro wings is better! 
Too loose 
Wish I waited 
Newborn size is 5-10lb not 7-12lb 
Not for a newborn over 7LB 
Good sleep sack 
Good but not perfect. 
Wouldn't recommend for a newborn 
Too many strings 
Ok. Not Great 
Mediocre but Sufficient - You get what you pay for 
Ok 
Broke! 
Keep slipping off 
It's an okay product 
Good pacifier...unhappy with color choice 
Get the Medela Brand 
What is with the tops? 
It is what it says 
Very very soft--not at all firm 
My boy got scared of it 
Potential but didn't work great 
Okay Faucet Cover 
cute for the money 
keeps drawers closed removes finish 
Good basic book 
Beautiful Outside but I wasn't impressed with the inside 
Too Much...for a calendar 
Wish it had more stickers

Cute Calendar - if you use it! 
Nice big play mat 
Cute but not really supportive 
Good product but doesn't always work 
useless for my baby but nice product 
good idea but doesn't work that well 
Bulky but works 
Nice product but the width for the spoon and fork not practical for babies learning to feed themselves 
Yes it shrinks. 
Good cover terrible washing instructions 
Shrinks and twists with washing but usable 
A lot smaller than I thought 
Nice fabric very tight fit 
does the job 
Ok 
Hole in the side of it after 4 months 
It's goodbut use other sizes more

Teeny tiny! 
TEENY TINY BAG 
Great design annoying to wash 
No hanging hook 
Fits a few diapers 
Only used occasionally 
Holds in wetness NOT stink!! 
Small? 
Item not as shown in photo 
The small is REALLY small. 
Leak Proof but not Stink Proof 
Will try another brand next time 
Needs a Loop 
Works great but a pain to wash/dry 
received different item than what's shown 
Small 
Great bag - small is SMALL though 
Very Small 
Underwhelmed 
Small for 1 cloth diaper 
Handle is already tearing off 
Smaller than given measurements 
Go with the medium 
Not as high of quality as the bag that I purchased before 
Snap on handle lost it's 'snap' 
Cute hold a lot but leak. 
yeah small.... 
Used for 8 months and leaks 
Just \OK\ 
You Get What You Pay For: Fell Apart While On Run

Very thin but don't have adhesive and fold under the bra 
Very cute bed but has issues.

Nice concept but ... 
Doesn't fit the Graco snug ride car seat 
Comfy nice material 
Expensive but nice. 
Not sure if I think this is necessary~ 
holds straws in place 
Like the clip. Ridiculous it can't be ordered by color! 
Too wide 
Munchkin cups - edge is a little sharp! 
Very lightweight 
Just cups 
Too large for little hands to hold onto securely 
Ikea cups are better and cheaper. (These Munchkins are just OK.) 
Get the Nuby set instead 
Good for Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail 
Work Okay 
Not sure these do too much 
Love The Smell - Doesn't Do Job Though 
Poor packaging so they all have to be used right away and don't last very long anyway 
Okay. Not fabulous 
could be better 
Expected more from Arm & Hammer 
Decent quality 
Not bad not great.. 
Nice product but needs improvement 
neh... 
Super tiny 
very mild 
No way to apply them light scent 
Work ok 
poor design and packaging 
It's ok 
Not worth the money 
Not great 
Decent Product 
Great concept; not as odor neutralizing 
UMMMM?? 
Not as handy as expected 
It's OK 
My son didn't love this book like I thought he would... 
Eh... 
Our son could take it or leave it. 
Just okay 
Serves its Purpose But you Need a Breathable Bumper 
Good size and quality but too big for trunk 
imperfections noted on the wood 
Waterballon 
Serves the purpose 
Works as expected 
Better than Gerber but not much 
Okay product 
Adequate Waterproof Pants 
Warning: Do not put in dryer 
Too big 
Great idea... 
Didn't stop the leaking 
Good 
Run huge 
Too big for tall and lean kids 
Better than in retail store. 
can't complain 
Good for price 
I wouldn't recommend this product 
it works but a measuring cup is better 
Eh... just OK. 
Works leaks a bit gets really hot not all bottles fit. 
Works But Is Difficult To Mantain. 
Good - not perfect 
Good but could be better. 
good heater but nothing special...do i need it? probably not. 
Can't clean...mold buildup/health hazard 
It's ok 
Expected a lot better quality for Dr Browns! 
Good warmer leaky 
Wish it was wider in width 
It's a bottle warmer.  Yeah. 
Works well 
Not really impressed 
Fine but unnecessary 
Very hard to get closed 
Disappointed 
Need the ability to choose color and re-order lids! 
Didn't fit a single door in our house... 
Did not work on any of 5 doors 
Didn't fit 
Doesn't Fit My Doors 
It worked great for me until my son turned 3 
Works but too expensive 
Affordable but don't rely solely on them for containment of children. 
Changing table is useless 
OK buy! Good stroller 
Short short short 
Cute but not the best 
Time lifesaver! 
works but... 
My baby loves it but.. 
Looks great but not functional (or safe) for infants 
Oddly designed and just doesn't beat my JJ Cole blanket 
Falls apart 
Burns not sure I like it 
I Loved It...but then it leaked 
Just OK 
Not our favorite sippy 
my kid never liked this cup and never would take a sip out of it 
It's the only sippy cup my daughter will use too! 
good product 
Handle Isn't Fixed in Place 
Great concept - wish it was dishwasher safe 
Nice...not perfect. 
Best caddy around but needs improvement 
Basically useless to us 
Bought it but didnt need it for car seat - great for Fisher Price Rock & Play Sleeper 
Seems to be sufficient 
It protects. 
glad i bought but 
Wish it was longer 
Cute but not quite as functional as I had hoped 
stylish large bag that doesn't look like a diaper bag 
The best but falling apart after 3 months! 
It does the job 
LOVE(D) THIS BAG! - Past tense 
It's not roomy enough.  Need More Space! 
Nice purse...less nice diaper bag. 
hot and cold 
Great idea but in theory. 
Good spoons but a little short 
Shallow bowl 
Better for play kitchen 
ok but not my favorite mei tai 
So far I'm not complaining 
Short-lived. Not good value for money 
Ok but flawed 
Ok organizer 
Cute design just not functional for us 
Nice night light but some design flaws... 
night light 
meh.. 
A bit too bright. Only red green blue for all night light. 
I like it but there are issues 
doesn't fit all tubs 
Works As Advertised But For How Long? 
This is actually the Carters Tree Tops sheet not Forest Friends 
Good but could be more robust 
Too soft. 
Stopped vibrating after 3 weeks 
It has suction cups (groan) 
As good as it gets I guess 
Suction cup does not stick 
too small 
Too deep! 
These are alright spoons 
ok i prefer softer spoons for really young feeders 
Ridiculously Long! 
Fine. 
Cute spoons but the spoon portion is too deep for 7 month old 
Spout needs to be replaced FREQUENTLY 
Not bad but not great 
No go for my almost 8 month old 
soft & easy to use 
Not great for us 
Get the job done 
Good daughter wasn't a fan 
There are pros and cons to this cup 
nice construction but doesnt fit well. 
cute but not what i was looking for 
I like other covers better 
Love them but too big for our 8lb new born. 
Not as big as I expected laminate is acquiring a weird texture - delaminating?? 
Okay liner 
Not as good as the Planet Wise 
Already had a hole 
Serviceable 
Daughter won't take them 
Love the Paci - hate the colors 
Nice drool control bib 
Scratchy material too big for a newborn. 
NOT unscented 
Prefer the newer version 
OK but a little dry 
Work well but they do smell 
So many better wipes out there 
Used to be good 
These are all right. 
Ok but wish they were wetter. 
Going with the thicker version next 
Wanted to love these but... 
wipes ok packaging not so much 
Very bad changes to these wipes! 
eh! 
not best seventh gen. product 
Mediocre wipes... 
Small dry and just not that soft... 
do not like their smell 
Decent 
wipes 
nice wipes a bit pricey 
Just OK 
EHHH 
A good unscented wipe 
Not so soft and gentle 
Could have been better 
A little flimsy 
So if these are \free & clear\ what does the scented smell like? 
couldnt use with a fussy baby 
Don't rush in 
Still prefer the traditional bulb 
Far too expensive for a marginally better product 
Works way better than bulb but.... 
Needs ventilation holes 
While it is a good idea and important for very young babies 
Only good for tiny infants 
Serves its purpose. 
Great patter Huge bag holds onto stink. 
Appearances can be deceiving 
My only complaint is how you have to wash it 
DId not hold up 
Sturdy bag 
Color Fades - Be careful how you launder it 
Great Idea 
Hold diapers but smelly. 
they work ok - the diaper dekor itself isn't great for capturing smells 
We loved this until my son started eating solids 
work but pricey 
doesn't hold as many diapers as it claims 
Expensive! 
Flex Nursing Sash 
It's just ok and the kid hasn't really taken to it much 
A good product but I don't think I'd buy it again 
Hard for baby to grip 
Recall?! 
Smaller than I imagined. 
nothing special 
Just ok 
Very Confused 
hard to hold 
Cute 
It's okay 
The Original Is Better 
Not good for newborns 
Kind of worked 
Soft but bulky... 
Soft cushiony but bulky 
Requires a lot of suction to work 
Great for home but... 
Not the best some leaking 
I like it but... 
Average kind of sippy cup... 
Doesn't spill but has a hard top. 
Leak Proof and Frustrates Baby 
Ok but son has no interest in using 
It smelled funny broke pretty quickly and made the water taste like chlorine 
Nothing really special... 
Definitely doesn't leak but hard to drink from as a result...... 
Cute cup but not spill-proof! 
Its OK.. 
Leaks a lot when tips 
It's ok.... 
OK but not great 
Pros and cons 
I really want to give these five stars but... 
Easy to use but mine broke after 5 months 
Not as easy to grab like Playtex ones. 
just okay 
My son loves them but they crack 
Ok 
Ok cup 
Work pretty well 
Good in concept 
Didn't work for me 
Too fast. 
for bigger tots 
Not Bad But Not The Best Either 
Good thought behind this but toddler won't use correctly 
It is a cute cup but not so good for training cup. 
Good cup but needs to be more durable 
Okay cup 
Too Much Flow 
Didn't quite work as I thought. 
design needs work 
Some flaws but OK 
sippy doesn't work 
Something my toddler will probably \grow into\ using 
Cup is ok but son refuses to use it 
Oxo Tot Snack Cup is Handy but Limited 
great idea.....difficult to open 
Good but the top can easily pop off and cause spills 
Lunch box size for adults but not toddlers! 
nice cup but opens when dropped 
OXO Tot Large Flip-Top Snack Cup 
Cap design is flawed 
OK.Plate 
lids comes off easily 
Nice toddler plate 
nothing special 
I really want to love these bowls but... 
Good but... 
Fine for me not as much for her 
Food falls out 
Not worth it. 
Great for baby food 
Good a little too wide for baby's mouth 
Spoon is too deap 
too big 
Too wide 
Usesless Fork....decent spoon 
good size for little hands 
A little disappointing for OXO 
Nice but wear out in 3 weeks 
I was expecting a little more from an OXO product 
Eh 
Wears out quickly 
Looks nice will probably have to buy again eventually 
Rusted after 6 months of use 
Good Brush Bizarre Nipple Cleaner 
Wearing out after one month 
Soft nice bristles HORRIBLE nipple cleaner 
Goods and bads 
It's Okay. 
Great Except Three Things - Needs To Be Replaced Sooner Than Other BOttle Brushes 
Great brush but already showing signs of wear 
Love the bottle brush dislike the nipple \brush\ 
Eh it's alright 
It is okay. 
Good quality but difficult size 
Keep looking 
Ok. 
Sturdy 
Just okay 
Nipple Cleaner? 
Brush is okay nipple cleaner is pointless 
I Expected Better from OXO 
Ok 
Hard to wash the thinner necked bottles 
Decent brush 
Great except for one thing 
works 
Annoyed with the nipple cleaner 
Nipple cleaner ripped my bottle nipple 
Just a regular bottle brush! 
Okay 
Bristles splash everywhere! 
Okay but watch out 
Sprays me in the face every time 
Not a fan of this brush 
Hopefully it works. 
High Quality strong smell 
Good not Great 
GOOD QUALITY BUT TOO SMALL 
Good quality. too small 
ok a little small 
quality is average 
Simple 
A little smaller than expected 
Check out the Shape 
Does its job but... 
could be better 
For the money its great 
Just OK 
Nice size changing surface 
not perfect 
meh 
Nice changing pad but bigger than I expected it. 
It suits our needs but... 
Great fork bowl and plate not the spoon 
I like it...except it stained 
It's nothing special 
Why do they make this without a good seal?  Spills breast milk very easily! 
Don't like the lid 
Three Stars 
Maybe I should have just gotten an Ice cube tray 
Doesn't seal tightly just get regular trays 
Wish the lid was air tight 
Using for another purpose 
Does what I wanted but not as well as I'd hoped 
Doesn't quite fit 
Good basket just big 
Don't Use this Much 
It is OK if you use it. 
Okay 
hard to fit a lot 
easily fits in dishwasher but can collect grime 
You can take it or leave it 
Okay 
Not as comfy as I would like 
Son doesn't like it 
Too little for older kids 
Seems nice but son is afraid of it 
It's fine 
Good in the beginning 
Sizing off 
Soft but not my favorite 
SO hard to install! 
Dissapointed I wanted to love this.

I wanted to love this snotsucker... 
Nothing Special 
More comfortable when worn alone. 
Not for me 
Love the product but One of the legsis wobbly 
good roller but not a favorite toy 
Okay I guess. 
Inexpensive easy yet unattractive solution. 
A temporary fix 
Big but ghetto. 
Cheap Disposable & Effective for SHORT TERM 
OK if you can get the wrinkes out 
useful but hard to install 
Mixed emotions 
Average bag 
This is hard to use.... 
Nice frame & matte but kit is impractical 
Cute idea but... 
Only one ink pad 
Inconsistant Prints 
Not as good as I would hope for... 
Fine for face wipes 
color dye runs 
Too thick 
Too thick. Too soft. 
Nice wipes but a few flaws 
2 layers get annoying 
Too bulky 
Some problems. 
Well designed 
ergo is better 
Honestly a little disappointed good carrier overall though 
I wanted to love this product but.... 
prefer ergobaby 
Good for tiny infants but kills your neck after baby is 7 months old 
i don't love it 
Great product design - but there is off-gassing

Haven't used yet 
Thick cloth diapers 
good diapers but very bulky 
These are huge

Leaked after 6 weeks 
Love the size hate the little things 
No flaps! 
I can only get one use before it goes in the wash 
Love the print but the snaps need work 
Decent 
snaps come undone 
Least favorite diaper in my stash 
There are better covers for cheaper 
I like it! 
It takes a lot of time to clip the buttons 
Decent but nothing great!

Some flaws 
super tiny 
Battery dies quickly

No Toxic Smell 
\Organic\ is misleading... 
Good but disappointed with the decorative edging 
wash cloths 
Great starter set but not the highest quality 
Not bad ... 
Works. 
A good stroller but I ditched it after a year 
I like the Look it is a decent stroller  but for me it lacks

Not a must have but a nice addition. 
Its ok 
Drops awkwardly come out and sometimes I can't tell if they fell out 
Good drops not bang for your buck. 
As described shipping issue 
Good vitamin bad bottle 
Good for the price.
