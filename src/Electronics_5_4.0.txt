A steal at this price 
Fantastic value not quite as refined as Trackball Explorer 
As good as a three dollar trackball mouse but it's a trackball. 
Under heavy use performs well but becomes erratic after 6-9 months 
Easy on the hand helps reduce strain 
My First trackball 
Better with enhanced software downloaded from Logitech 
Almost perfect. Still beats by Kensington Expert mouse except the price :-) 
We now have TWO of these 
pretty cool 
I miss the scrollers 
Good for when you are tired of the mouse
