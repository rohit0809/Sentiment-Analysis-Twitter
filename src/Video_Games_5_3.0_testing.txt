Good but room for improvements 
Replicating the magic of Symphony is not so easy... 
Just Okay 
Surprisingly fun for a generic game. 
i haven't had it long so i can't really judge... 
Fantastic game until you see the in ring action... 
Not Much Wireless Without The Rumble 
Okay 
this was a good game 
Great game but needs something... 
Well it's a heck of a lot better than the previous games... 
Decent 
Fun for all DBZ fans! 
A flawed single player game. 
Love it but it shoulda had improvments and the whole saga 
Great presentation but the gameplay needs improving 
No lasting appeal whatsoever 
Same great gameplay if you can get past the graphics 
An  Average Game !!!!!! 
good game 
Pretty Cool 
A Fun Fast Racer without a Lot of Depth 
A reasonable alternative to GHOST RECON. 
A hit and a miss. 
Let's be different 
Decent Fright Factor But Not on Resident Evil's Level 
Not sure about this game 
It's really good but... 
an annoying disgrace 
On the better side of Average. 
dont judge a game by its title 
Great plot mediocre everything else... 
Skip this one and the second one and jump right to part III. 
Great RPG for any RPG gamer 
eh 
Not Bad But Certainly Not Great 
Darn my eyes why don't I like this game? 
It is Evident Why I Ignored This For 11 Years. 
Decent game especially found at a decent price 
Some good game play...some hype though 
Lots of Blood - Bordering on Gratuitous 
A fun game but mine feezed on 8th level 
Missing a lot of features 
colin mcrae rally 3 
So near greatness but gets lapped to average 
ok rally game 
Almost 
Fairly Decent... 
Enternaining 
A Webslinging OK time 
Could have been great 
Definitely a Rental 
Fun fun fun - best Spidey game to date 
BETTER THAN THE FIRST GAME. 
Nostalgia quenched 
Great but......... 
Great games... two of them anyway. 
High Scores are KEY for these games 
You can't save your high scores 
Worth the $$$... 
Game came dirty but in the end it works 
This is an OK game. 
Um.... 
O.K. Game but its missing something 
Incomplete 
Better than the stink of MK3 
A typical RPG for the Gameboy 
Problematic yet strangely attractive nostalgic 
Hardest game in history 
Mortal Kombat 2 review 
For MK Fans Not For Casual Gamers 
This game really did not live up to the hype 
This entry fell a bit short..... 
ok 
Good System but Expect to Spend at Least $50 for Each Great Title. 
Hard to reccomend 
Interesting console 
Don't be fooled by the high ratings 
Average side scroller comic beat 'em up fare 
Decent but could have been better. 
When the computer cheats the game isn't fun anymore. 
Step 1. TURN OFF THE COMMENTARY 
Tony2 
GT Advance 
good challenge 
Not Quite As Good as It Appears 
LIMITED PLAY 
A good game but could be tweaked more 
Twisted Metal 2 still better 
Slightly Disappointed 
Do NOT buy for single-player 
why so dark&gt;?? 
Not much new but a solid implementation 
Best in the series but. . . 
Great game lacking depth 
GBA LInk Cable 
hi 
Occasionally behaves a little temperamental 
It's good 
Not quite James Bond 
NEAT GAME! Just way too short. 
Good game.  Nothing unexpected. 
can be addicting 
I Wish Better Graphics Weren't the Only Positive Addition 
Interesting and fun but pales in contrast to competition... 
Too slow 
Change my mind? 
Decent but not well balanced 
3.5 stars actually 
This game was okay 
Not my type of game 
I was expecting more from a sequel for a classic game. 
I liked Civ II a lot better 
Started out good but... 
mediocre 
Fun at times but incredibly annoying! 
Lots of changes to Civ 2 - some good some not so good. 
A bit more complicated.... 
Good but not great 
Somewhat decent FPS for the GBA 
Beautiful but not hugely satisfying 
It's early but it's not looking good. 
One of the best ideas for a MMORPG 
A good sequel for those who liked the first 
Concept is there but the game is lacking 
Both terrific and terrible. 
Great Graphics but a bit too busy 
It's good and it's not French (yet) 
You've Been Warned: Not a True RPG 
Not what the world was waiting for 
This game aint for me. 
Nice graphics shame about the game 
Nice atmosphere - tedious gameplay 
good dungeon crawl 
hey did anybody know this was made into a movie... 
How original can lucas be ? 
the pc game equal to star wars chess 
Star Wars RTS 
So Repetitive! 
Falls short 
It takes more than the Force to become a Jedi... 
a classic but probably not worth too much time or money 
Great game but some issues drag down the hype. 
Yes for the music and graphics 
A Worthy Sequel but lacking overall. 3 Stars. 
The Best of Times the Worst of Times 
Better than Gold and Silver but not by much 
Pikadissapointment 
Pokemon Crystal version-only for Game Boy Color 
Bloody Roar 3 coulda been better.....although it was good. 
Great looking but dulls easily 
A decent but thin fighter 
So So Fun for Classic Enthusiasts 
Great old games ! 
lets clear up a few things. 
It's Okay But Game Shark Could've Done A Little Better. 
Good Collection but Could be Better... 
Good variety of play Pac Man is Pac Man 
Great game but not perfect 
I only wish I could play 
Classic games...not so classic load times... 
Big title reissue draws little enthusiasm 
great rental decent buy 
A decent thrid party memory card that does what it's designed to do 
The Memory Card is for the Controller So I can save and load games. 
Its a playstation one memory card ! 
A Symbol Of A Bygone Era In Gaming 
Short but it works 
Intec Component AV Cable PS2 
Exactly as ordered. 
Works OK with PS2 
Didnt work with my Vizio & PS2 
I've had it since day one 
Been there done that 
What's all the fuss about? 
Red Shelled Crash!!! 
Great Graphics Poor Play.
