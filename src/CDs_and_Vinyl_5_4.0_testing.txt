Still unrecognised 
Tool is one-of-a-kind - absolutely outstanding! 
An epic 
the actually songs deserve 4.5 stars but the filler shouldn't have been on here 
a bit overdone 
Some awsome tracks but I like there other works better. 
Falls just short of greatness 
Great Album

Freaked Out 
\These Mothers is crazy\ 
So here it is Zappa's first album. 
Freak Out!

Zappa's sophomore outing shows his style 
I'll never forget what's her name. 
The origin of many concert classics 
Absolutely Priceless 
good cd but sound is just of the era 
definitely overrated

Lots of fun 
We're Only In It For the Chipmunks 
Zappa at his best if you don't mind the baggage 
closest thing to Zappa's vision

One facet of many 
charming singalong oddity

Excellent musical overview of Zappa but he's done better... 
Zappa's finest work? 
Hesitant on Zappa?  My review might help 
instrumental stuff 
excellent and a half 
Fun album 
loose disconnected 
Infuriating and mind boggingly complex but it's good if you 
rips yr ears &amp; brain 
Razor burn 
Such an experimental jazz stuff ... another memorable l.p. 
A great place to hide from reality 
A sampler for a set that never happened. 
Four may be too conservative 
Zappa Mixed Bag? 
An FZ Must-Have But Not For Regular Rotation 
A frightfully frantic FZ album that should satisfy any fan

surprisingly heavy

Blends virtuoso musicianship with crude humor 
I used to have... 
3stars 1/2 is righter:it's a bit overrated but remarkable 
Falls somewhere between the loony and the tunes 
Very good but not perfect 
turning point album 
new Zappa sweetness 
4 stars and 1/2 is righter!!Excellent live!! 
100+ minutes of Zappa & co. madness 
wackiness in hypermode 
Bought this album when I was a kid.

Get past the first 23 minutes and... 
\One More  time For The World\ 
Sleep Dirt 
sleep well lads 
It can't happen here 
Only Flambe is flambe'ed by the vocals otherwise INCREDIBLE 
My Fingers Got Stuck 
Why were vocal tracks added on the CD reissue? 
I could do without  the vocals but the music is great. 
Sleep Dirt 
underrated 
ap

Zappa's guitar and humor at its' best. 
Great album. BUT... 
Not His Best
