A review by a Kevin Ayers fan

But for AGNUS DEI this is mostly light weight cheese. 
Great 80s CCM album...but not what I'd call timeless

from Solo Piano Publications 
Mannheim Steamroller brings nothing new to the table. 
Nope 
Cut him some slack 
Disappointing Thompson 
Lost on Me 
Not really the best introduction to Nick Drake 
Nick Drake is overrated... 
A disappointed fan 
Not his best - for completists only or those interested in Buddhist chants 
A failed experiment 
SHEER TORTURE 
More Richard Thompson PLEASE 
The worst album Richard Thompson ever made 
good music bad vinyl 
unlistenable 
This does nothing for me 
Not a very good album... sorry. 
tired aloof and coy 
Nothing to Get Excited About 
Not my favorite... 
Not what I expected 
Why was this junk even featured in a TV ad? 
Insipid pedestrian 
Nick Drake is overrated... 
Fans can never be objective... 
fun uptempo tunes but didn't enjoy the pop and droopy ballads 
This cd had an all star cast but came up short......... 
Slow down Maestro ! 
a voice teacher and early music fan 
Too much of the muezzin 
A cool period-flavored German Requiem that leaves no real impression 
Be sure you like &quot;original instruments&quot; before you buy! 
HORRIBLE Sound! 
Exciting Peformance Poorly Recorded 
ehh... 
Sorry but this album is pure poop 
Large Disapointment 
Trash(ed) 
Little did I know punk is still dead. 
THIS IS NOT THE CD EVERYONE TOLD ME ABOUT 
Okay but just not &quot;Punk&quot; more like Polka 
Seemed like a good idea 
Good songs recorded like crap! 
weak roach 
Enjoyment 
Annoying Dissapointment 
Rolling Stones from Texas 
Desilusionante 
Not the best

Anita...not much gold in her career or personal life! 
Go for the Taragon piece 
Marginal at best 
Prodigal Misstep 
Better Than Nothing 
Where's Procol Harum? 
Dated Production Mars Return of Legendary Group 
&quot;I played it during my yoga class but they just didn't dig.&quot; 
wiccans(new witchcraft) at their best 
MJK's lyrics seem misguided  ignorant and self-serving.\Opiate's\ music suffers as well. 
BEWARE: CD-R 
not for me 
the one I liked the most? 
I like a bunch of other bands that are supposed to be similar but this music is boring to me 
Binge and dirge 
Give it a miss 
Borefest 
Well This Is What It Would Sound Like 
\S**T\ 
Band sounded really sloppy and much of the show drags... 
I liked about half of it 
By far this band's weakest effort 
A couple OK songs but too artsy for me 
Tool? Heavy metal? 
Oh Gimme an Aenima! 
thinking man's band for the average joe 
Prog-influenced?  I Think NOT... 
Tool - heavy metal 
Inconsistent and way overrated 
Lots of boring wankery with some interesting moments 
not for the tool fan 
BRITISH POLITICS 
I'd almost rather listen to Outside the Gate! 
Not many of my favorite classics on this one 
Only three good songs. \Masterpiece\? Nonsense! Don't believe the hype! 
Lackluster to my ears 
Tending to title track 
Bowie at his strangest...and that's not a good thing. 
Bowie's first big transformation. 
'Money-maker'- 
Cubic Zirconia 
always struggled with this one 
A thankfully short aberation with two good songs 
Bad Bowie. 
A bit dull. 
Bowie goes Philly soul. 
Clearly Not His Best 
Worst of the \Classics\ 
Horribly average 
Worth A Listen  But Not a Must-Have 
Very Over Rated 
Massively overrated 
HIGH 
Disappointing 
maybe transitionally important but not a good album

Just Bob Being Bob 
No 
Good sax. 
Yawn 
Had my hopes too high I guess. 
Just plain boring 
Not very interesting 
Fuzzy mess 
Mediocre/Pretentious 
Boring distorted tenderness 
Gimme a break... 
More narrator than singer this dreary CD contains one great song 
Strangely Hypnotic- Until Yoko Pipes In

Ugh... 
Yoko walks like an Egyptian 
The nadir of Yoko's post-Double Fantasy catalogue 
whoa freaky! 
A hint of things to come 
Frank's worst blunder: poorly re-recorded masterpiece 
Start Cryin' Zappa Fans: This Is NOT VERY GOOD..... 
more lumps than gravy 
Curious Zappa novices beware 
Wasn't quite ready for this one 
Avoid the \colorized\ CD and get the original if you can find it. 
A ruined version of a great album 
Find the Vinyl version and add two stars. 
Zappa loses his audience on this one 
Really really over rated 
descuido prolijo de un genio..... 
Not Frank at his best 
Imagine me and you. 
Highly over-rated by paid critics; I found this boring and mediocre 
Great Album. Poor Vinyl. 
Half-Baked Dada 
A low point in the Zappa collection 
A CLASSIC DESTROYED 
UGH...not the brightest moment in a career 
I don't get it 
Aw come on...this is crap 
A road map please? 
Annoying record 
JOE'S GARAGE: ACTS I II AND III (ZAPPA RECORDS/1979) 
Rip off remaster 
Musically uninteresting and lyrically dated 
Oh Frank what happened? 
Without a doubt Zappa's worst and least interesting album 
bueno  esta bien hasta los genios la pifian alguna vez....... 
The Weakest Zappa Instrumental Album 
I'd rather it be neither them or us 
Ick. My personal vote for the worst Zappa effort... 
Fish been laying on the dock too long 
Does Music belong in Humor? 
Zappa meets Firesign Theatre but he didn't get the drift 
Nice Bass Relief..... but... 
Full of intellect perhaps but sterile. 
Advanced yes amusing no 
Not one of Frank's better releases . 
Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar minus the charm 
Annoying snippets 
You're No Fun Any More 
Uh how should I put this... 
Like most comedy albums good for 1-3 listens only 
Hard on the ears 
One last rodeo before setting sail 
Flat frights 
You know how people complain about albums with only one good song on them? 
I don't get it... what is she still doing here? 
so bad it's kinda good.... 
ALMOST BUT NOT QUITE 
For Completists Only 
Costello's first mis-step 
Imperial heresy? (2.5 stars) 
Punch drunk 
A guilty pleasure or two

Elvis' most overrated album 
One of his worst 
David Lee Roth was Right 
So funny I forgot to laugh 
Take the title literally. 
I Don't Get It 
Not my cup of tea. 
take my name away! 
A great talent but far too annoying to be enjoyable 
Moderate stinging 
Sound Effects CD 
RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: \THE BLUE$ EXCHANGE RATE WITH JAPAN IS LOW!\ 
EXCELLENT POTENTIAL - NEEDS REMASTERING 
Foul Language 
Severely dissappointing 
Fossils and Dust 
Misshapen Monsters on the Prowl

It was worth trying.

Where did Steve's beautiful voice go? 
2 stars for 2 songs. 
\Freaky cover picture\ 
THIS IS NOT ALL OF HITCHCOCK'S MOVIE MUSIC 
Great Swing Band-one of the best.  But 
Greatest Hits By Whose Definition? 
Crafty Curb 
Bobby Goldsboro / All Time Greatest Hits 
The reason this is not a good album... 
WEak ! 
Just Decent 
Another spotty compilation from Curb Records 
Great Songs bad product 
Watch out!  They say these are not originals 
A tale of two Unchained Melody's this collection contains re-recordings buyer beware! 
WARNING:  Mostly Rerecordings 
It's Sad When The Best Available Is A Curb Product 
NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS!! 
Not the original releases 
Sad Indeed 
Don Mclean wasting time on Curb records. 
That's not rock and roll anymore... 
Poorly Packaged Cheap Compilation 
Not her greatest hits 
Long version of Green-Eyed lady needs to be available as download! 
Donny & Marie Greatest Hits 
\Greatest Hits\ of Donny and Marie? Not even close. 
Brazil'65 DIDN'T HAVE ANY HITS... 
I Heard Mama Say To Daddy 
For The Most Part Lightweight Pop 
The Curb Approach To \Greatest Hits\ 
All re-recordings. Not bad but all inferior to the originals which are readily available 
Curb Records Does It Again!!! 
Nice try but you are no E.L.O. 
Starts to go downhill at this point 
weak compilation 
OK album but her next two albums were better 
BAD! 
For Bloomfield completists only 
What a Bummer 
Another Curb So-Called \Best of\ With Notable Omissions 
Terribly Overdone 
Fantastic voice + hackneyed songs = bad LP 
It would have helped if she didn't sing too LOUD on this one! 
Studio problem? 
Mary Goes pop? 
sophomore effort falls flat on its grape 
Well at least they tried 
Don't Buy This Trash! 
exellent musicians putrid sounding cd. 
I'm gonna get clobbered here . . . 
TIME WAS . . . . .
