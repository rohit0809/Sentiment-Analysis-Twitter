Jarrow Formulas Resveratrol Synergy 
Like this product but worried that it has less resveratol 
Not much Resveratrol in this formula 
contains little Resveratrol 
how to check for results of this supplement? 
Should Be Called \Synergy\ 
Good combination but dosages are low 
I'm no nutritional expert but 20 mg of Resveratrol seems low 
Placebo? 
Has some decent antioxidants but label is a bit misleading 
No Harm in Trying 
Poor Name Choice 
Pass - the dose is too low for me 
Not Much Resveratrol - Some Green Tea Grape Skin and Grape Seeds 
Great for my circulation 
No Side Effects small dose though of actual Resveratrol.. 
Jarrow Formulas Resveratrol Synergy 
good stuff but what's in a name 
Read The Label! Does It Provide Expected Dosage/Benefits?

not much resveratrol for a resveratrol product 
Gotta Love Jarrow! 
Seems OK 
never tried before 
Heard the Raves 
Name not necessarily accurate

Concerned About Active Ingredient 
I'll pass on the staining thanks

Not sure it works as well as other brands 
Just OK 
The blade was set so short from the factory it cut me repeatedly but after having a barber adjust them they have been fine. 
Not what I thought 
Scratched my head.

Good Product but the taste... 
Not sure 
not sure if it worked 
Pretty uncomfortable 
Good not Great. 
Not enough scent for a larger room! 
These are not as great as some of the other stick scents I've used. 
Nice for decor but not much else 
Takes getting used to 
Different Scents Had Different Scent Strengths 
Nice gift for certain people; opinions will vary WIDELY on the scents; Not for budget minded 
It's okay... 
Easy and pleasant but not really aromatherapy 
About average in the 'home fragrance' line 
Lacking fragrence life... 
Neat product but these particular fragrances are not what I expected 
Better for use in small rooms 
Nice gift item 
Great scents not very strong though. 
Now You Smell Them Now You Don't 
Not strong enough 
A nice alternative to heavier scented products. 
Scent Diffusers 
Good for a party but not long term 
Not Strong Enough 
Pleasant Enough But Nothing Special 
An interesting alternative to mainstream fragrance dispensers 
Safer Than Lighting Candles But..........................................

Bought for Streamlight Nano Flashlight 
It's true they run out fast on the bark collar 
Not so good 
my review 
A lot thicker than I like. 
Use Caution 
This is okay but not enough L-Ingredients 
cheap but some are \D.O.A.\ 
Great price but they don't last 
only work great with customized tray from dentist 
Not a first line treatment good if you work nights or during winter in northern states

A little disappointing 
OK Vitamins 
Slightly more affordable option than the popular name brands 
Comparable to Flintstones w/Iron; Better Price 
Chewable multi vitamin with iron for adults or kids. * warning dye allergy red lake #40 
Taste Fine in Comparison to Most Not as Complete as Flintstones 
Great value for the money! 
But Will Your Child Swallow Them? 
Good Vitamin That Actually Has Iron 
Not as many vitamins and minerals as Flintstone Complete... 
Replacement brush heads 
Brush heads were fine but I returned Sonicare for Oral-b 
Used by a soon-to-be dentist

Good but not the best on the market. 
No way to know the difference it has on your body 
Average taste but quite pricey 
Taste Not Bad But Product Not for Me 
Much more expensive than other competing whey supplements not necessarily better 
`Whey Better' than a hardboiled egg? More expensive for sure... 
Good Flavor Good Mixability otherwise same old same 
WOW! 
Dissolves easily but taste is on the bland side 
Pure whey isolate but has sucralose 
tasteless with water doesn't fill you up hard to mix 
Fake sweetened flavoring 
Very good but SO overpriced 
good nutrition but not among the best in terms of taste or consistency 
Good but way too expensive 
Tastes Okay............... 
Great source of protein but pricey... 
Way Better Whey Protein

Feels comfortable in but was hard to remove 
Trippy and cheap 
Mixed reaction

Okay product 
Works well but 
Over Priced and cheaply made 
Amplification is not linear:  high frequencies accentuated... may work for you but not for me. 
works but... 
Simple needs a wireless headset 
Decent 
I'm not sure yet! 
HUGE CAPSULES! 
Just an average toy with above average expectations. 
You can find better for the price 
Won't stay in...

Okay Considering it's Inexpensive 
They do work 
Ouch. 
Good fit. One sorry box. 
I was sent polyurethane powdered gloves 
Fine 
Don't see any better results than other variations on the theme

The real deal 
Works well--but painful sensitivity! 
Not stronger than regular strips 
OK but ................ 
Green Choice

BPI RoxyLean 
Energy: yes. Weight loss: no. 
Too many blades too little comfort -- a demonstration that less is sometimes more 
Nice but overpriced 
The same as my regular (and less expensive) Venus! 
Eh not bad but not great! 
not the closest shave 
not the best of their selection 
Actually my wife's review if you must know. 
Not bad; but shaving takes twice as long 
The New Gillette Venus Embrace Provides Longer Lasting Shaves 
Ok But Not Great 
Not going to be Embraced by me.... 
Too Smooth 
OK Not Great 
Manual Shaver 
Gillette Venus Embrace Razor - Great Razor; Holder Aweful 
A few good improvements...until next year's replacement. 
Good product 
Another fine (if slightly unneccesary) addition to the Gillette lineup 
Not Sure 
More Mortal than Goddess.... 
I miss my Sensor Excel for Women but... 
Lots of Tricks But So So Shave 
Prilosec is more effective 
great for heartburn relief 
Too Big and Bulky 
Feels fine while wearing it 
Works well expensive. 
Too stiff for my tender plantar fasciitis feet :( 
Not so effective but convenient 
Make sure your hands are dry. 
It worked 
Arrived on time not sure how well this product works 
Does what it is supposed to. 
No magic cure 
Okay but basically ben gay 
$21 for the Chinese version with horrendous English subtitles 
not as good as shamwow but they do the trick 
They're OK. Not great 
shrinks after washing 
Didn't do a thing (for my dog). 
Heel Inc Zeel

Butt protecting cushion seems squishy 
Good for freezing fell apart in the microwave.

I made another mistake 
Could be better 
Blank expiration date 
Nice 
Good nasal spray 
Very Average 
Soothing but... 
Minty! 
Thought it was 400 mg per capsule 
Probably Not a Weight Loss Magic Bullet 
Works for a while? 
Some change in weight 
Okay I think... 
400 mg of green coffee extract per serving to keep you energized 
Unsure as to how it works 
tastes okay but what is the hype? 
What does it do? 
Doesn't seem to work for me 
Quality product but had no impact on my hunger 
Good concept; results uncertain 
We will see 
Gave Me The Jitters.... 
Less Than Phenomenal 
It seems green coffee beans means less dreams 
No Quick Results 
Amazing results - for the first two weeks ... 
Gives a slight boost 
Too Early to Tell... (but Intriguing Enough to Keep Trying...) 
Didn't Work For Me 
Didn't really do anything for me 
No Difference 
No conclusive results 
Not for weight loss 
Hard to Say if it Has Any Effects or Not

Hard to Judge 
Green coffee beans and chlorogenic acid 
Less than Effective 
Didn't work for me

Didn't notice anything new 
Small weight loss -- disturbs sleep 
May work ok 
Supplement designed to benefit the metabolism 
It is ok. 
Not really impressed 
They made me anxious and jumpy. 
No jitters but uncertain about impact 
Don't know if it's helping or not 
Keeps me awake at night... 
Mixed Review 
Seems to work 
Far as I Can Tell This Will Be a Good Product 
Nothing happened 
Helpful but unsteady 
it's the taste 
Good formula a little too much sugar for my taste 
Great company... 
Works well on very minor pain 
Really About Average So Far 
Repeat Review 
Not quite up to par 
Compare cost to benefit 
OK pain relief 
Works for minor aches and pains but not major ones 
Moderate Pain Relief 
Not for my tendonitis 
Good but not great only short term pain relief 
Not a miracle but helps soften the pain 
Temporary relief 
synthetic 
Hard as heck to swallow 
A little better than Snake oil 
Works sometimes 
I have always loved this product - so when it said Original I ... 
Price is reasonable Havent noticed much of a difference 
Mehh

Worked for me but the taste is not the greatest 
Too bulky but seems durable 
Not comfortable

Decent work well but lid doesn't stay shut 
Careful... 
Decent 
I use it as a water bottle. 
Its OK

Messy stuff 
Works Good 
I don't know. 
They are just okay 
Might be fine for some but for me they're much too tight around the ankles 
It didn't work for Dad 
The handles are too short 
It can work or help but it's got a down side as all these items seem to size just being one. Awkward to use another. 
Not Large Enough 
Works well but maybe too much? 
Good flosser for the right mouth 
Got lost 
Time will tell.
