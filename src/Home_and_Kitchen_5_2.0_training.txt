Disappointing 
Cheap and hard to use 
Cookie Nutters For You! 
Wish I'd gone with Wilton's 100-piece set!

Not what it used to be 
Sloppy Fit but necessary item 
Not a lot useful stuff in it

Shreds okay slices horribly 
Not the easiest to operate 
I sent it B A C K! 
faster than trying to slice with a knife 
KitchenAid RVSA Slicer/Shreader 
Unimpressed 
Not worth it 
Returned it & purchased something else. 
They work even though they are short 
A poor substitute for a dedicated stuffer 
A lot of meat gets stuck in it. 
Better than trying to stuff sausage with a chopstick but only just. 
Cheap plastic won't last 
Does the job but takes a long time 
Works great... when it worked 
Pasta: Art or Science 
Surprised and disappointed 
Either does not age well or needs periodic maintenance 
Lasagna Yes Fettuccine No Spaghetti No 
Is it the right size? 
Good Idea but not worth the trouble 
Remember this is a \pouring shield\ as the name does imply... 
It was a great idea but needs redeveloped. NOT worth the $$ 
Just wasn't what I expected 
NOT for Classic Plus Stand Mixers 
Not so great 
Not designed correctly.

Love the filter buy the Brita 2-Gallon UltraMax instead 
Great if you want to tone your arms 
Black stuff 
Not sure if filters work. 
Hmm.. Brita filters are great but these weren't top notch 
Taste Fine. 
bad product! 
Not Quite Right 
NOT Accurate 
Sturdy poor craftsmanship 
Yes it does spray grounds

It's obviously not a KRUPS grinder 
coffee grinder by capresso 
well conceived but poorly executed

It's a pain to use in hardened ice cream 
Do you own a pyrex dish or a corningware piece?  If yes skip this. 
Performed well but... 
Sieve not fine enough for oil 
Mine had a manufacturing defect. 
Product description doesn't point out a \feature\ 
You have to lift it up from the bottle to allow it to vent even though....

Major dislike of Calphalon 
The coating is not good at ALL 
This one didn't do it for me! 
Calphalon One no where near the original Calphalon 
Own this and a whole set of these 
Calphalon now makes a good chamber pot... with a lid. 
Skimpy!!! Thin and sub-standard. 
Worst Calphalon pot 
Beaters are rusty! 
An electric carving knife should do a better job than this one did. 
hard to grip 
It cuts but is it worth it? 
Not powerful enough and on/off trigger is maddening! 
It's fine if you don't use it much........ 
Very low grade plastic cracked immediately 
Not worth the money or effort 
wanted to make blizzards 
Not very powerful 
Ok for occasional home use 
Not good for ice cream :( 
How strong do you have to be...? 
28 mins for 4 waffles? 
Not my cup of tea 
You get what you pay for

But then I still have an 8 track somewhere... 
Bring back the manual model 
Thermometer Woes 
Not a good value. 
Nowhere near \Instant\ 
Not \instant read\

Keep in mind it is a pocket thermometer. 
Broke very quickly 
I really wanted to like it

I'd hit that \Pause\ button before giving a  (5) Star Rating :) 
Unreadable

Doesn't stick. Disappointing. 
Doesn't stick 
Doesn't stick very well 
sponge holder? 
Broke after a few months 
Worked for 2 1/2 years - light use 
it never got finer than coarse chop 
DISAPOINTED 
Eh... no 
Avoid food processors. 
Okay for the price but the settings are not great. 
Crapola for a food processor 
Wish I had bought a bigger one 
Cheapens the Cuisinart Name (but is functional). \Chrome\ is plastic! 
so leaky! 
For The Home Chef&#8230; 
Worked for two years but didn't last like my old large processor 
didn't work 
Recieved a poor quality seconds item instead of a retail quality first! 
I love Fiestaware..but.. 
White glaze scratches easily 
Need to revamp their finishing quality control 
So sad so scratchy 
loved it until it broke
