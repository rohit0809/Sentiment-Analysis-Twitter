Foiled by the foil 
The Over-rated Shaver 
For sensitive skin never again! 
A dull razor right out of the box. 
Even at $54 it's not a good purchase 
Uninspiring Razor 
mediocre shave 
Not good 
Not good if you have much facial hair. 
Looks nice but does not shave well.  There are better options below this price point.... 
Why? 
OK for very short beards but very time consuming... 
Women are Hairy Beasties Too 
Not as good as past Norelco products 
Strange engineering! 
I wanted to like it 
It is what it is and it does what it should but not the BEST! 
Typical Electric Shaver 
Not really a lubricant...a spray cleaner yes! 
Redmond Clay 
Doesn't mix well and at 5 scoops is a horrible value 
not sure if it works 
Follow-up Review After Almost Two Years of Use 
WAY TOO LOUD 
I really wanted to like the Arc 4 electric shaver 
I'd prefer a more reliable less-close shave. 
Smells great but I'M PEELING! 
Wish it work but it doesn't 
Does not silent body odor! 
didn't work for me either...... 
Didn't like it there are better products out there 
It was ok! 
I don't buy the reviews 
A Bit Disappointed at first later pleased then unhappy

Causes razor burn 
Don't waste your money 
Panasonic NO match for Norelco or rotary heads.

DONT BUY

These protect blisters but fall off easily 
Pad Sticks to the Blister 
Good but don't get them wet.....

Get Tom's instead. 
Not as good as leading companies 
Too thick and falls apart easily 
NOT SURE IF NEEDED 
To smooth 
Nothing new or extraordinary. 
I can't deal with the many times my skin keeps getting stuck in it!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Thick hair forget this product 
You get what you pay for... 
A Review of the Degree Clinical Protection 
scent stings the nose 
Incredibly Strong Smell 
not all that it promises to be at least for a man 
The smell turns and then wafts up at you. 
Didn't Like This One 
Those who seek natural products will want to avoid Degree Clinical Protection - contains Aluminum based products 
of all the clinical protections this is my least favorite 
Caution: leaves residue behind on dark clothing 
not that great 
Smell too intense.  Clinical is not much stronger than regular.  Directions say apply at night. 
Clinical protection VS regular 
Apply at *NIGHT*?!?!?!?!? 
Not good for sensitive skin***** 
I expected better from Dove 
I wanted to love this.

Dr. Scholl's Soothing Foot Powder 
Hot 
They are okay for a few days.

Not fond of the flavor. 
Tasted terrible 
Disappointed

Totally work but lists Aluminum 
Buy in store not online...or not at all. It's not that great. 
Battery dies too fast 
I liked it for a week then the battery died 
No power 
Way too strong for me 
Not 3\ except in the middle 
Did Not Work As Advertised 
Steamer 
Not impressive 
It's ok for quick jobs. 
Works as a steamer but does not clean well 
This is not the best 
Very Flimsy 
EXCELLENT features 1 YEAR LIFE THEN NEARLY WORTHLESS 
Bad reaction 
Doesn't really do anything in my opinion 
My armpit still sweat. 
Didn't do much for my chapped lips 
Didn't work for me 
I couldn't tell any difference when taking this 
If you can handle the extreme sourness and are patient this could work for you 
Blech! Not worth the \savings\ 
Two Stars 
OOPS! 
Enteric coating NOT effective! Large quantities of pure essential oils in the stomach = MAJOR PAIN 
Optimum Fish Oil? Uh no 
One of those \bargain\ fish-oils with hardly any active ingredient (EPA & DHA)

Comparing with Original 
This could be bettter or a lot worse 
Cheap Razors 
Not Good Blades

Glide has changed 
Not as good as the former Oral B super floss 
A Little Better........Maybe 
Not What I Thought It Would Be! 
I really wanted it to work 
Scent too strong 
Works Okay But Not Much of A Deodorant 
Not a good value for the performance. 
Not a pleasant smell... 
Effective product for a questionable purpose 
It works.  That's the best part. 
No added value for added price 
Could take it or leave it. 
I Didn't like this 
effectiveness depends on the season not as good as a prescription 
NOT for sensitive skin 
Works well enough NOT a solid! 
The Real Cost: $56 
Nothing special about this product doesn't live up to claims 
Not so great at a premium price 
Secret Clinical Strength (light and fresh scent) 
Surprisingly ...average 
Semi-liquid paste-like antiperspirant and deodorant

Overpowering (and a bit unpleasant) smell 
No Better than Regular Deodorant 
ordered  for mom 
Deodorant is effective but the packaging is flawed 
Crumbly product doesn't absorb bad applicator

Effective but expensive and uncomfortable 
Overpriced and Ineffective 
Why not just get a Neti Pot? 
Size is Wrong for Travel and Price is Too High 
Much less expensive alternatives 
Not Very Effective 
I wish the container was refillable. 
Not really cost-effective to clear your sinuses fully but okay for light nasal irrigation

Taste Bad and chalky 
Must love chalk

Ruined my sheets 
Made for a nice cookie/snack but I wasn't too big of a fan ...

Perhaps AZO's Worst Product 
Less than Stellar Sweetening and Taste 
Not worth the side affects 
THESE DON'T WORK..... 
These made me feel wired 
Product for Mood But.... 
very effective but hard to swallow since very rough on the edges 
Gets gummy/ sticky very quickly 
probably not the best for your money

Lovely scent but evaporates very quickly 
OUCH 
Feel like I'm just gliding plastic stick over my skin.
