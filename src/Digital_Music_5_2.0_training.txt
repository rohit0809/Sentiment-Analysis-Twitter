What I think of Em now 
Eminem is talented...but too bad he had to hook up with Dre

Disco Diva 
Really Didn't Do It For Me 
The Same Old Busta 
A good rapper but no good CD.

There is more to life than lots of swears and hip-hop beats. 
Mmm...Chocolate starfish and hot dog flavored water... 
A disappointing album far inferior to &quot;Significant Other&quot; 
Disappointing. 
Yeah it's overrated. Most of it isn't great. But.... 
SOME OK SONGS and A LOT of SILLINESS.....
