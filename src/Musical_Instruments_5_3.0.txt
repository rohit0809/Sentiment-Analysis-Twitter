Didn't fit my 1996 Fender Strat... 
HAS TO GET USE TO THE SIZE 
maybe not the best but it serves it's purpose 
Standard guitar cable 
average cable 
Good for the Price 
Does Its Job 
There used to be better stuff 
kinda worked kinda didn't 
Thin cables... 
Not bad but the Cool Cat line is $4 more and a better build 
A reasonably decent capo that you can afford to leave somewhere 
Just an ok capo 
Silk and steel strings 
OK 
lot of money for foam 
My mistake for buying sight unseen. 
Nice Guitar but sounds 
3 Stars Good value but it needed a lot of work 
Not mahogany.... 
Great design - love the switch 
Disapointed in Planet Waves 
The most basic of basic distortion pedals 
It's been around for decades but..... 
Great just not what I was looking for in sound 
Using it for Danelectro Mini Amp 
Step to turn on/off 
serious musicians look elsewhere 
Too much noise 
Durability Issues with Potentiameter 
Not Enough Pressure For A Mandolin 
So far so good but may have found something much better. 
Screws strip too easy but good if you can screw in 
Good 
Works but had to \ruin\ a strap for everything else. 
Aquila is better 
It gets the job done. That's what matters right? Aha.... 
Three Stars 
Provides Some Protection 
Not Bad Picks...

Good & Bad 
These Are Purple Not Black!! 
Stubby is right 
OK 
Small Hard Good for Lead Guitarists Only! 
Good pick not great 
Good just not for me 
Too small 
Depends on what you're playing 
Nice pick but try the XL 
OK but nothing special 
Strikes and gutters ups and downs. 
Not what I would grab to play with 
Not sticky enough 
Better than nothing 
Nothing Special 
OK? 
does the trick 
Planet Waves Humidifier 
Simple Product Kind of Inconvenient 
meh. 
Good product idea could causes problems for some people. 
Works not great. 
cheap 
Nothing Special 
regular. 
Using Pedals With it is a Mixed Bag 
It's ok 
slippery and young 
Does its job 
Good for what it's worth 
Great idea! 
ehhh! 
just ok 
Planet Waves Pro Winder String Winder and Cutter 
Good tool 
Good all rounder 
Good but not excellent... 
It's not too bad. 
Hate the pushdown bottle heads! 
Not necessary 
I guess this works but it's kind of a pain to use. 
Great sound but fickle quality 
Hard on the fingertips 
Ok strings 
Take Good Care of Your Strings and They Will Last Longer! 
Sound good but not worth the extra cost 
Honesty is the first key in marketing

Great feel and handling but not the sound I like 
bad ears 
they are ok 
Underwhelmed 
Not very impressed so far 
Good concept 
ehhhh 
Make sure your control plate fits 
Improper Wiring Diagram 
Fender vintage tuners 
looks good but..... 
Requires drilling 
Maybe what you really need is a new set of strings... 
Hard to install 
Be careful about using capos like this because if you're using a fine guitar 
a little iffy 
it's just ok. 
Second best. 
It works... 
Less than 12 picks...but good sound 
NOT A GUITAR CASE! 
A pick is a pick... 
Challenging To Apply 
Poor cables for active guitar players. 
Not that impressed 
It works but moves around easly 
Fine 
80/20 Bronze Strings 
tonal quality is flat 
I wasn't impressed... 
They were strings... 
EXP 16 Strings 
Dang... Not what I Hoped For 
Decent Stand For The Price Quality Could be MUCH Better 
I don't like that I have to continually tighten the knob at ... 
Wobbly 
Cheap surprisingly sturdy. 
Very transparent 
Useful but hard to dial in 
Mediocre IMO 
Good Quality for the price but needed proper setup 
A step up from a soft gig bag 
It's great if you want to quickly drop your hats but not so good on coming back up. 
Good childs guitar hard to keep in tune. 
OK starter guitar for a kid 
Ukulele: too large fork  (plus update) 
Ok but it would be nice if the table was collapsible
