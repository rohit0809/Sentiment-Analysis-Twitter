Good looking pencil too small though. 
Cap and pencil body color don't match 
feels like fake ones

Not a big fan 
Do It Yourself Hanging Folders? 
Good product 
OK at first but lots of issues!

Stick with the ordinary staple remover or your fingernails 
Very well-made but a bit clumsy 
I find it difficult to use 
This One Doesn't Cut It! 
These are definitely \stick needle fine point\. 
Great idea but one fatal flaw. 
Traditional dispensers are better and cheaper

Good envelopes but not as advertised. 
This is Not a Security Envelope. 
Just another ordinary envelope with \features\ 
Not the best I've used... 
FAIL! 
You don't have to lick them but... 
Why? 
Just okay--I would not buy them again. 
Neat concept for envelopes but more glue and darker ink are needed

Very Unstable Drivers on Vista 
Not as good as this one!

Overpriced. 
HP black ink teeny supply 
Stiff and hard to work with 
i find the shape odd 
Difficult to access quickly

Disappointing 
Don't recommend 
Just Another Poor Multi-Line Cordless Option 
Caps get lost easily 
Most definitely not \strong bold color\ 
Won't replace my 5.8 Motorola! 
Don't buy it for the speakerphone 
Decent features for the price - not sure about the quality though... 
Maybe handy in a pinch but no substitute for learning the language 
Not Ready For Prime Time 
Inexpensive But Cumbersome Interface 
Updated review and one less star 
Seems slow to get \to the point\ 
Though its seat cushion is very comfortable it still lacks adjustability options 
Very good quality but made for taller people 
Not worth it 
Not allot of ink 
Didnt stick for me.... 
Good idea but they don't stick that well. 
Works fine but with annoying shortcomings 
Might as well use plain paper 
Solid product but not so \Reduced Effort\ 
Jammed each time every time 
Pretty mediocre printer 
Paper feed issues and HP's ink conspiracy 
Disappointed

A little misleading... 
It is actually USD 5 of postage - the USD 45 is only on subscription 
Sturdy unit---see update please 
labels stick in printer

As bad as it gets 
Might actually try the satisfaction guarantee for these \Permanent\ labels

Dotted Line is not aligned with perforated tear off point 
Did not stay put for long

Avery PocketTabs - OK For Storing Papers and Cards Insufficient For CDs and DVDs 
shame on them for releasing it like this 
Would not purchase 
This isn't my favorite 
Plastic post it 
What's the point? 
A product looking for a good application 
These NoteTabs seem to have a limited purpose 
Mystery tabs! 
\Just one word:\ 
I get it but don't know who would use it 
Limited usability 
No Thanks 
Concept not well executed 
Mac Support? (Not Office) 
Not worth the cost especially for occasional use 
Wasteful 
I like my bigger PaperPro Stapler better 
Cheap and complicated to use 
Construction a bit \Cheap\ 
Works For Awhile 
Not the worst printer I've ever used but it is close 
Strictly average 
Anybody remember the 1958 movie \The Fly\?

A solid design...if it wasn't an inkjet 
Unsatisfactory 
Certain features missing 
Misleading and confusing price structure 
Static and other noises in the line! 
Very very thin 
Right size too flimsy 
Streaky printing 
Don't last dry up quickly bleed through and smears 
Ink are not well marked 
Remarkable color all-in-one for its price point (updated) 
A Total Waste of Money! 
Why re-invent the notebook?? 
Not as nice as the picture indicates 
Good idea but lacks a lot of thought 
Adult trapper keeper? 
Narrow Use. Not Impressed. Cannot Combine with a Paper Planner System. Large Bulky \Organizer\ Doesn't Hold Much. 
Too Rigid and Bulky 
There are better options available 
Well it's big. Useful? Not so much. 
disappointing 
Works OK for my PC Recovery Kit 
An expensive attempt to reinvent the notebook 
Decent for a small project or for a very specific purpose 
Nice theory- but fails in execution 
Good size and storage but insufficient cushioning 
Used with an HP Envy 17 
Not very good flow 
Decent introduction to numbers and math 
The actual stories are not helpful.

Excellent for Taking Closet Space 
An Interesting Idea Hampered By An Uncertain Execution--A Footrest I Frequently Kick Out Of My Way! 
Broke after a few uses! 
It's a footrest with a fan? 
Not all that useful 
Not necessary 
Sorry Kodak but your printer firmware and wireless are problematic 
eliminates a problem that does not exist 
Basically functional but quality isn't great -- noisy 
Gimicky 
Great idea falls short on some finer points 
I Appreciate The Effort but Not the Results 
Sorta comfortable but slowly slides on my chair mat 
I thought I'd like this but it's not for me 
Hard to assemble not high enough 
pointless? 
Disappointing colors 
Need to SCRUB to get it off the white board 
Not very good 
Just Ok 
Not impressed at all 
Doesn't sharpen evenly. 
so-so because the well for shavings is too small 
This pencil sharpener is great 
Doesn't perform as well as marketing would lead you to believe 
In my opinion: Meh. 
Not worth the price. 
O.K. but not for classroom use 
Relatively okay 
Saves space but don't like how it sharpens!! 
Not very good. 
Didn't work for my purpose 
Dissappointing

Not that great even for the price 
Couldn't get it working 
Useful in some ways... not so much in others 
Way smaller than they look 
I wouldn't buy this not likely to last long 
Kind of crappy actually 
I can't imagine what you would use this for. 
It's Cute and it Works But Not Worth $16 
Not as cute in person! 
Fun design but not sturdy 
Great if you enjoy filling landfills. 
Fun but not Functional 
takes up too much room 
Just ok 
Why? 
A product we do not need. 
What was wrong with regular scotch tape rolls? 
This product made me angry 
Good concept but does not work! 
A Product That Serves No Purpose 
strips come out bent 
Not so useful to me but it works 
Overrated. 
Not that useful 
pop up tape 
Annoying to use 
Nice idea execution could be better 
Poor predictability severely limits usability; Seems widely OK for very short usage 
Not As advertised 
If Something Sounds Too Good To Be True.... 
Lets go when you aren't looking 
Does not hold well and takes off paint 
first use and it didn't work 
Not exactly what I hoped for 
Total Crap 
Early model that needs more tweaking! 
Just another thing to need to buy refills for... 
Great for Cards and Scrapbooking! 
I'm mixed about this product... not good for children! 
loser 
be careful where you use it! 
Not Really Reusable 
Funky double-sided tape 
bummed 
High hopes but disappointing 
Generally disappointed.  Tears paper only VERY light material stays put. 
I really wanted to like this... 
My small clock fell off the wall 
Holds but doesn't release well 
Dries out and loses stickiness. 
Scotch Reusable Strips 
Hardly a great item for teachers 
Only OK 
Edited review 
Relatively thick note tab but poor adhesive 
Coverall 
No personal outgoing messages allowed 
Not Impressed 
Get a real dictionary! 
Limited appeal 
Not worth the price 
Mediocore at best.... 
I Finally Gave up on This Thing! 
Too many slots too close together 
Low Quality Sound And Short Distance 
BlueTooth Barely Works 
Gimmicks? Check. Quality? Not so much... 
Great Concept...Poor Execution 
AMAZING product -- but only on paper :( 
Nice features but difficult to operate 
Good but possibly *too* disposable. 
Dry erase markers write well but stain the white board 
dull color and the orange doesn't erase 
Laptop Post-It Dispenser? Really? 
Disappointed; Looks Like a Product in Search of a Market 
Idea is ok but holder is flimsy 
Not Worthy 
Another 3M \Why\ product. 
I think I could live without them and still have a rich rewarding life 
Interesting idea but no. Not for me. 
If it ain't broke... 
no positive point 
Slightly Cumbersome 
A Pretty Basic Holder for Fanned Post-its 
Cute idea in theory but impractical... 
Poor Design but Great for Reaching the $25 Free Shipping Limit! 
Destined for Big Lots stores 
Only Partial Design Success 
Not really necessary 
Not useful for heavy users of post-its 
more of a pain than a help 
Interesting concept but clumsy and disappointing 
Surprisingly less than what you'd expect for what it costs.... 
Good ideas in need of refinement... 
A great idea but the reality was not so great. 
I am so disappointed 
Disappointing experience 
Don't believe the picture 
Not Up To Kensington Standards 
TErrible Dry Erase Board. 
Wish they were better 
Did not handle stains 
Divy It Up 
does not work as intended 
It's not good enough for me. 
A great way to get you to buy ink cartridges 
One stays the other falls.  Low price = weak magnet 
Not too good 
Using to scan textbooks for school - Update: has issues! 
It only takes one bad cartridge... 
Good price but tears easily. 
More \hand friendly\ but not the best tape. 
The Vanishing Ink Trick 
Doesn't lock in place 
Very flimsy 
Flimsy and no perforations

Flimsy cover 
Better products out there...
