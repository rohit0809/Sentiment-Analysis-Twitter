Good for what it's worth 
Okay 
Disappointed again! 
First time buying a Wilton yearbook. Won't do it again 
I hoped for more 
Not what I was expecting 
very basic! 
Ok but nothing super exciting 
You get what you pay for...kinda 
Cute design but not good for long term use. 
cover fell off 
Good for certain things 
too young to be talking about the good old days 
cheap 
pretty short for adults 
Pretty but flimsy 
Not quite what we 
Just a food chopper 
SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED. 
Not made to the same standards as older devices 
Not as good as the large ones 
not impressed! 
decent for what it is 
Ten minute's use requires fifteen minute's cleaning. 
Does the job 
Good for very fine fast chopping 
Hit or miss... 
Paddle broke within 2 months 
good but could be better 
good for sobet not for an ice cream 
Not exactly instant gratification 
Makes great ice cream but motor has problems 
The ice cream maker makes clunky noises and doesn't always work correctly 
Louder than my dishwasher!!! 
Some other fittings may not work with this fitting 
Works. Not without duck tape 
Work great reliable but use lots of power. Buy digital ones. 
it didn't work at first 
Avoid if you have small kids 
Ok for the Price 
Not blown away... pun intended 
Probably the best available today but 
Ability to move air is limited

A powerhouse of a canister vac but... 
Can be annoying 
Not As Advertised. Kill-A-Watt shows it as a 10 amp motor... 
Decent but not great 
The little vac that almost could... 
Vacuum OK Flimsy but still works 
Ok for quick sweeps 
Just got it!  It is heavier than I expected. 
There are better options available... 
Has a hard time picking up anything but Lint. 
Almost perfect 
Works very well on small jobs like spots. Extremely LOUD. 
Unit can tip over! 
It turns the beater bar 
Belt 
Haven't used it yet

As ricers go this one is really nice. 
Only one size 
Very hard to press

Smaller that I anticipated 
Gets the job done but could be better. 
Could be better

Rust 
Not up to the OXO standard. 
Wooden Version is Better 
It's OK. I prefer my wooden one. 
Great until... 
after two years... 
good pullup locking mechanism 
VERY long for kitchen use 
OXO rubber doesn't hold up over time 
Okay but harder to control

Way too big.. 
Liked older version better 
Very useful but annoying 
Newer Model Not an Improvement 
Takes up a lot of room 
My old one is better

Best Feature Is Also The Worst... 
Better than a regular ice cube tray

Not the best Oxo product 
It's okay... 
Handy but could be sturdier

Has other uses too.

Attachment 
Works Well But Overpriced 
Overpriced 
Not bad

Good starter tool for the price frustrating for multiple / large batches 
Slow stuffing 
False description... 
One batch and the Fettuccine cutter failed. 
The pasta roller is great

handle with discomfort 
Handle not as good as the 5 qt bowl; broke off 
Eh . . . 
Pouring Shield 
KITCHENAID POURING SHIELD 
It sometimes works 
it all depends on the weather 
Thought it would cover better 
Frankly a little disappointed 
Useful depending on what you use your mixer for... 
Good mixer for light use

not big enough for my projects 
Amazon's price is not all it is cracked up to be 
Okay but not same machine

Working out the kinks 
useful spice grinder 
noisey 
Cracked after a month of using it. 
Keep that coffee coming... 
Not really for spices 
Enough for what I need 
Not bad for a blade grinder 
It's OK 
Krups touch coffee grinder 
Okay but could be better. 
Uneven results when you don't want very fine grind.

Does the job 
Coffe grinder not so much 
A simple no frills grinder. 
It works but I'm concerned about the long haul... 
Does not grind very evenly 
Nice grinder but weird burning smell. 
Feels cheap but works fine 
Too Small For Me 
It's alright. 
Great grinder but messy

Good low-priced choice 
Worked fine at first.... 
Not As Good As I'd Hoped...

Good idea not well executed 
I had high hopes for this sprayer and was disappointed it has never sprayed well 
Sprays but also makes a mess 
Misto Brushed Aluminum Olive Oil Sprayer 
Works with some drawbacks

The Older One Was Much Better! 
Eh It's OK 
A bit disappointing 
It's OK 
Good Idea Questionable Durability 
A bit of a pain in the butski 
It's okay 
it's an option to Pam sprays 
A little disappointed by the spray

I prefer a larger size 
TOO SMALL FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON 
Not as good as other Brita's 
First Impression Not the Best 
Excellent fresh-tasting water but a few \gotchas\ 
Good water if you can accept some design flaws 
Water tastes great!  Pitcher needs some work. 
Had to return 
flakey 
At this price just buy another Brita Slim Pitcher 
It does what it is supposed to 
Cornered market 
good filter for a bad product 
Ordinarily would give 5 stars but... 
love it! 
It's a water filter

A Good Pressure Cooker that is Reasonably Priced 
You need Yogurt to Make Yogurt? 
A cheap incubator 3-1/2 stars 
Disappointed with this yogurt maker 
why buy another appliance when the oven does better? 
$14.99 is the lowest price so far 
Easy enough to use but it's easier to just buy your yogurt. 
Never used 
Homemade yogurt made simple 
Could be better 
Does not work with the new Unison line 
Very solid but kind of inconvenient 
Not the Calphalon You Remember from 80s/90s

Overpriced - very overpriced 
Eh it's ok if you are right-handed 
Not All That Special 
Very nice but fragile 
Beautiful but ridiculously fragile - buy Spiegelau! 
These pyrex bowls are great but price is wrong.

Great bowls just not for mixing 
Deep dish casserole wasn't DEEP 
Very thin. 
Spend your hard-earned money on the scotch 
It was okay

I agree with the others here... 
It's a cheap china (not capitalized on purpose) product 
Okay 
Nice but could be better

When It's Good... 
Not Fancy 
This is the only way this works 
Works Great but guides needs to be moved first

OK but wobbly. 
Adequate. 
Okay but... 
Could be improved on. 
Meh...

Helpful Kitchen Tool?  Not Really! 
Meh does it's job sorta.

For the price it's not so bad. 
Wood is soft and scores easily. 
Just OK 
Cheaply made but working so far

Definitely not the same as the trays that come with the dehydrator 
New to dehydrating 
Good trays 
It works 
Had this for years 
Look closely at dimensions! Appears larger than it really is. 
Cute but a bit overpriced 
Fairly decent mug some issues over time however & doesn't hold a true 14oz

Believe the bad reviews... 
Niche pan 
Good heat retention 
Calphlon Saucepan 
'Commercial' grade???  Pardon my laughter (Chinese cheapo). 
The Ugliest Calphalon Money Can Buy 
Is the coating safe to eat? 
Works all right but NOT non-stick 
Thinnest calphalon pan I own 
Made in China??? 
Three Stars 
Not For Lefties! 
Was great...when I wasn't using it... 
First speed is NOT slow 
good but loud 
Works good 
Nice and cheap 
good product. 
Power Trigger a Little Awkward 
Cuts well but handle too slick 
Adequate but not great Food Processor 
It's O.K.

Not the best temp scales. 
Slower Response Time is Aggravating 
Just OK 
It's just fine 
I discovered new laws of nature... 
Not So Instant

A problem with the case... 
Ok 
It's what you'd expect... 
Just OK 
It melted. But it still measures. 
Okay

Suction cups 
When it Works It's Great 
Not a fan 
Does the job 
They work but not perfectly 
works in the oven but hard to read the temperature 
Good enough for the price 
Not great for candy making 
$6.99 regular food thermometers only go up to 220 degrees Fahrenheit 
Worked great until I made caramel 
Disappointed 
Just OK 
Some problems but a good basic thermometer 
Suction cups don't work after awhile 
Works after adding an additonal suction cup 
Needs better suction 
like it mostly 
Smaller than the earlier version

Should be listed as sink accessory holder 
WILL NOT STICK 
Good holder 
Does not anchor in sink 
Doesn't stick 
It's OK

Works sometimes. 
Three Stars 
They will do the job if you pump enough.

A fragile beauty 
THIS THING IS SO LOUD! 
noisy! 
smashes more than it chops 
Works alright but has some flaws 
Flimsy blade construction 
NOT BAD 
Great for small tasks but didn't last a year 
It's a chopper / grinder not a food processor. 
A chopper not a REAL food processor 
It woks so-so 
Good but not as economical as rolls 
save your money order the rolls and specialty items 
The product is great but I'm not a fan of the company 
really thought it was a much bigger roll 
Expensive 
Mis-Leading Size Measurement 
Excellent! 
scratches over time 
product quality good but ivory color not 
Fiesta Ware is Timeless Packing Not so Great!! 
Three of seven sets broken in shipping (so far)

problem 
Pepper Mill 
Inconsistent results finicky eventually fell apart 
Not bad 
not what it's cracked up to be.... 
Pretty but average 
Good product - but don't buy white 
Poor results for baked goods 
Definitel worth over a hundred bucks... 
Old Fashioned way to spend money 
It's difficult to wash it since it's narrow and long.  . 
All glasses are not uniformed 
Beautiful and Functional 
Used to be the best...now a little to be desired 
Doesnt Swing but opens cans well 
Handle grips fall off 
Shame on Amazon! 
How can the same openers be so different! 
Worked When It Stayed On \Track\ 
Solid and Functional but what have you done in the last 50 years? 
Pricey! Great for Spices 
Can't reuse 
attractive but tempermental for canning 
Great vacuum... but so far don't like the bagless/hepa combo 
I thought Hoover was the best? 
A mixed bag 
Too noisy for my taste 
LOUD 
Still undecided 
didn't notice a difference 
This model not worth the extra cost. 
Jury's Still Out 
Not The Fan To Get For 90 Degree Temps! 
Expensive but perhaps worth the price 
Like so many others great while it works! 
Costly to operate 
Two order one worked... 
As we are doing remodeling and needed bedroom air cleaners 
Updated review: Its gets noisy over time. 
Stopped Working 
Quiet???? Confused! 
average cleaner 
Too loud for the bedroom somehting was wrong...

Light sleeper? Perhaps not the best choice. 
Does the job but rather noisy 
Flimsy 
Ok but not great. 
Nordic Ware Universal 8 Cup Double Boiler 
Functional Double Boiler Insert 
Hard to Scrape Out Broiler Pan 
It is a Poor Substitution for a Double Boiler but the Best one I've found for Cheap 
Nice but difficult to handle 
THESE ARE JUST OKAY 
Burned part of the holder Lodge Striped Hot Handle Holders/Mitts Set of 2 
not so special mitts 
Useful but not as good as they used to be 
Okay buy 
Prefer the sillicone ones... 
Good fit decent value should be more heat resistant 
Ok but... 
Not so hot 
Well made top quality but... 
Small for ends of pots and pans handles 
silicone may be better? 
Doesn't Hold 13.25# Turkey 
Observations using this roasting pan. 
A bit thin 
Lighter weight than Grandma's roaster! 
Chipped after two uses 
it is not the quality your mom's one had 
MADE IN MEXICO NOT USA 
Cheaply made compared to the older models. 
Manufacture defect have to order another.  sigh... 
Pretty lightweight for a roaster 
Good product poor shipping 
Wouldn't buy the same vacuum again 
not bad but not very good. 
Decent Entry-Level Juicer 
decent juicer 
GREAT VALUE - But not a great juicer 
Nice little entry-level juicer 
Foamy Mess 
Slightly Messy 
Decent for a first juicer 
Poorly designed.  Better systems exist 
Leaks and Spits 
Pretty good until it died. 
Not so good 
Not the size I was expecting even though this has the correct serial number 
You get what you pay for 
Not much to say. 
Not Exactly \Universal\ 
i am sure filter is ok 
Works somehow loud and inconvenient 
These ARE NOT original pre filters 
Depends where you buy it 
The item is fine but... 
Works as advertised 
Good enough for light jobs with some disadvantages 
Needs Some Tweaks To Make it 5 Star 
Half good - Half bad 
Handy but Needs Some Improvement 
Vacuum Belts 
they mark easily 
If you're looking to \buy American\ don't buy this!

Good idea but could be better 
A nifty little item but.......... 
Just O.K.

Nice Humidifier.  Ran down quicker than I expected. 
Do you have a second? 
Awkward 
Great design poor quality. 
Little Champ Needs a Work Out 
Pretty Good 
It's okay barely 
Too small 
Does the job 
Avoid \Non-Stick\ cookware. 
Great Idea 
Why Did Farberware Change the Shape? 
Too small for burners 
balance is not good 
farberware quality not what it used to be 
good except plastic handle gives off fumes when hot 
Adequate at best 
I love Farberware !! 
Heavy 
It looks beautiful but... 
How many people does it take to make coffee?? 
Finicky but useful 
We shared one happy year together.. 
2 yr old. Died today. RIP. 
Not That Good 
Too pricey 
NOT GOOD WITH EGGS 
Too big for my Induction Cooktop burners 
It works fine but.... 
Cooks very well but the handle is not comfortable. 
Gotta watch the heat! 
great construction poor engineering 
Awkwardly shaped 
A workhorse but buy the one with the loop... 
WRONG ITEM 
Stainless can pit 
Do not use as a sauce pan (use only as a saucier) 
all-clad construction but bad engineering 
Not \fit\ for my pan 
Looks over function -- right here! 
Heavy for daily home kitchen use. 
I like 'em (now) 
Super Nice- Doesn't Grip well 
it's so sturdy that it's too heavy 
It's Quality BUT!!! 
OK but expensive and needed to return 1st set 
Works but Does Not Get A Lot of Points for Design. 
Purchased because of the reputation 
Does the job but hard to clean 
A fine example of a nonstick grill pan - but nonstick grill pans are a flawed concept.  Also - it's not \clad\. 
Not LTD but decent for aluminum 
Not \LTD\ as shown tho decent 
Smallish cooking surface and not great on smooth cooktops 
Perfect for bacon perhaps 
Nice Knives 
Mediocre Knives 
Beware the scissors! 
Sleek Machine Good Brew but Overrated 
Flimsy especially for the price... 
Unpredictable 
Krups 
Nice looking but so-so quality 
Adequate 
Harder to slice pinnapples this time around 
Great until the coating deteriorated 
Average at Best 
Pancake griddle 
3 Years in and non-stick kaput... 
meh 
Used almost daily now wearing out 
Is this really needed ? 
Non-stick....BUT 
meh 
Not as nice as a Silpat. 
Matfer Exopat Nonstick Baking /Roasting sheet 
Not sure anymore????? 
Not my mom's Revereware 
Needs more upkeep than I bargained for 
Not as it used to be 
Not classic Revere ware 
Not the Revere Ware of old. 
Not the same as the older one 
Revere 3520027 Line 2-Quart Covered Saucepan

Doesn't quite live up to the claims 
RIP 
Casserole 
Healthy Alternative but this is NOT Pyroceram Glass 
Nice enough I suppose 
ok 
The Picture is Misleading 
Lids don't fit! 
Lids lose their seal quickly 
Bowls are small can be used to serve to 2 persons MAX 
Glass storage 
Lids Leak - Not Airtight - Lid is Flimsy 
If only the lids fit snugly 
Updated Review 
Decent set could do with better quality lids 
Great bowls awful lids 
Adequate 
Alright 
Very good but slipery when taking it out of the oven 
Smaller than I thought 
Can't get the lids off without spilling 
Nice 
A few changes could improve this line 
I had to struggle with the lids. 
RECTANGULAR lids LEAK!! 
Lids Leak 
Good and not so good 
Great dishes but putting the lids on the bowls is hard! 
They broke upon arrival! 
10 pieces includes the lids actually 5 storage containers 
They are ok 
great until you break them 
Glass containers are great but some lids don't fit well 
Chipping around the top rim. 
I used to swear by Pyrex - maybe not so much now! 
inconsistent lids or glassware 
A perfect assortment 
pyrex bowls 
Not Strong enough... 
Be Carefull in . . . 
strong breeze but loud 
loud little powerful fan 
Noisy but effective 
Have 2 of these - and 2 different experiences 
Oh No Not Again !!!!!! 
Still not my first choice. 
warped bottom after 2 years 
Does not work with the new Unison line 
Excellent for what it is - but Manufacturers Defects Are Bad 
Have not used yet. 
Not bad 
Not the best 
Ok 
Not 1 peice 
Cumbersome 
You will need a 12\ diameter griddle (or skillet).... 
Clumsy but they get the job done. 
Egg/pancake Ring set 
Nonstick egg ring set 
Looked like a great idea but.... 
Great Idea - Bad Design 
It works okay 
good for the price 
Different than McDonald's... 
OK but could be improved 
Kind of flimsy 
Reasonably built but meant for light use 
Works very well but too small. 
Smaller then it looks 
Overpriced 
just ok.. not perfect 
Too heavy for its size 
good 
Okay but not dishwasher safe! 
Smaller than expected 
Not exactly what I expected
