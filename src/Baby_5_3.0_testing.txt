Doesn't fit nicely around the crib and too thin to reduce bruises 
waste of money? Very polyester. 
Keeps the pacifier in the crib 
It's an okay liner. 
This is good but is far from perfect 
Good product 
Good for a while 
If you care how it looks try something else if you have a solid-end crib 
It's OK 
Breathable Bumper 
Not quite a perfect fit 
Perfect but... 
It's okay 
broke pretty quickly 
Too small 
cute but not practical 
Image of colour is very deceiving 
TOO SMALL 
Very cute.  Disappointed on quality. 
Not bad... 
metal handle 
Decent 
Not dishwasher safe even on top rack 
Great Beginner Spoon/ Stains Quickly/ Heat Indicator Not Too Useful 
Stain easily 
Okay 
strange... 
These spoons are okay but not my favorite 
useful but small 
Eh. 
Great for convenience; very mediocre for pumping 
Expected a better pump 
Disappointed with its performance! 
Convenient and portable but VERY SLOW 
Beware - Lactation Consultants Advise Against This Pump 
Works okay but is too loud and spills too often. 
Nice to get things done while pumping but horrible letdown 
watch out for spilled milk! 
Okay but not worth the extra cost 
three and a half stars 
A must but very poorly designed. 
Works well if all other dishes are clean 
Okay 
Fits bottle parts only fits 3 bottles. 
Could be better 
Munchkin is better and holds more bottles 
VERY large 
Nice lightweight fabric but my baby can wiggle out 
Colors Vary NOT RETURNABLE 
good 
My daughter doesn't like it 
Not my baby's favorite 
cute bottle but my baby doesn't agree. 
They are ok 
love UTN but baby is bored with this toy 
Very Nnice But Does Not Fit All Cribs 
Does the job but not our favorite 
Great bottle but hate the nipples 
No evidence no damage no customer service 
Not thrilled with the velcro attachment and height 
Didn't work for us - not the greatest design 
Good but there's better 
Slightly disappointed. 
Not very comfortable 
cheap fabric piled up after 1 wash 
Nice until washed 
Doesn't fit the pack and play 
Makes baby sweat... 
Pretty good. 
Shrinks lengthwise but super soft. 
Great at first but morphs over time 
Not so soft 
seems ok but.... 
Baby Blanket 
Organic... but made in China? 
Great toy but be warned: FALSE ADVERTISING! 
Didn't work for us 
They're just OK 
keep the little ones out 
Slows down access 
OK product does its job 
get the job done...kinda 
Get the better brand instead 
Flimsy but they do the job! 
Nice but not great 
Great colors 
Good quality but too small 
Cute but can really only use 1 side 
Not awful but don't need more 
Pretty but not practical 
Stiff material 
These are ok but a wash cloth does the same thing 
cute not practical 
Looks vs Function 
Only the terry cloth side is absorbent. 
Cute But Scratchy & Not Very Absorbent. 
Cute but not very practical 
Cute... 
Cute but not the best quality 
just ok 
Cute but... 
Generous size but not as soft as I had hoped 
beautiful but... 
It's a fairly low quality decorative towel 
Not soft/plush 
Not as nice as I expected 
Manly and nice looking but really too small to be a diaper bag. 
Bought 3 and used them twice in 7 months 
Average washcloths 
Decent washcloths but nothing out of the ordinary 
prefer the snap n go 
Not Needed 
Baby jogger makes some great stuff not too impressed with this though. 
for the same price buy a cheap stroller frame for your carseat. 
It works 
DOES NOT WORK ON CITY SELECT MODEL! Make sure you order the right one! 
We haven't found this useful. 
Much larger than I expected. 
same as regular clipper 
Can't really see the baby's nails 
Okay 
Light is a plus but the clippers are not very sharp. 
Light button is a design flaw 
Baby Nail Clippers 
bad design 
Light doesn't help me 
Hate the light feature 
Ok 
Not my favorite swaddle blanket 
Nice product but for smaller babies only 
too many bells and whistles 
Makes tummy time tolerable 
Not too thrilled 
just ok 
Ehhh 
Nice mat - not a miracle however 
Cute but my daughter didn't use it long 
Just ok. 
Great idea 
Makes Tummy Time a little more tolerable 
boring... 
Real cute  but does not fit on the high chair tray 
Works but still able to move 
Successful ... for about 10 minutes 
Cute designs but the suction ring comes off 
A little disappointed 
Cute plate but suction base is pointless 
Wore out to quickly 
Great Looking Just Not Durable 
They don't hold much... 
Fat mouth! 
Not sure how I feel about these 
Spoons are a bit large for toddler's mouth 
Cute pattern small neck hole. 
Love the design but haven't held up well 
Cute but not as easy to clean as other vinyl bibs 
Regular 
Cute bibs but quality is just okay 
This blanket is not 30\x40\ 
It's  just ok 
Mostly works if you use it according to instructions; tends to run warm 
I would get it again 
It works ok 
Good for Travel - not everyday 
It's sort of pricey 
Very Cute 
Doesn't stick to tub/Great customer service 
great product but.....one big issue 
Thin 
Nice 
is ok 
what I was looking for but could be a little better 
Do not know about durability 
Ok-ish 
kinda rough 
Quality varies 
Dundee Burp Cloths - White 
Eh 
Good price - Shrinks 
Good but a little rough 
Won't Buy Again 
not so great 
A little too big for my little guy 
Not great for scooping 
I don't love these 
Easy scoop but messy! 
Makes a GREAT teether 
Too Big For Little Mouths 
They're just okay. Sorta good sorta bad. 
Better with accessories 
Undecided 
Not as easy. 
careful with the legs could pinch! 
Useful but not amazing 
meh. no better or worse than other tiny potties really. 
Not sturdy in \potty\ position 
Pointless... 
Never Got to Use It 
I got the reusable liners and re-fills too 
Great portable potty but a bit short 
Good concept but kids not certain.  Maybe after fully-trained. 
Not great for boys going pee 
Buy with Reusable Liner for best results 
Quite low to the ground and too small for a 3 year old 
Doesn't work as well for boys 
unstable as a stand alone 
Great idea but small! 
Gets the Job Done 
Don't squeeze the bottle 
Great crib but NOT great toddler bed! 
Love Naturpedic but this is not their best 
Fits Da Vinci Mini Crib 
Not as firm as I'd like for a newborn... 
It does not seem waterproof... 
cute set but the sheet doesn't fit 
Not really worth the high price 
Our baby ignores it 
Not a favorite 
Nice product but not a baby essential 
This is mostly useless but cute... 
Not what i expected 
Took a few tries and some water to get good results. 
Easy to use but not amazing looking 
Did the job but it's heavy and has cracks 
Good but overpriced 
Easy to use hard clay 
Pretty good.  Subject to recent recall. 
Big 
works well 
DaVinci Emily 2 Sided Crib Mattress 
My baby seems to be comfortable but it doesn't fit my Emily Crib? 
Not worth the price 
This monitor is louder than my sleeping baby. 
Just Okay 
So-so quailty but the design is good. 
Nice Size 
My son loves it but.... 
Glad I just borrowed it 
Works well not easy to hang. 
i like it but I like toys better then the baby 
Nice but difficult to clean 
Not very satisfied. 
cute 
It's just OK 
it works 
only plan to use once 
Dried out but got it to work 
Washes Easily But Not Impressive 
Nice ball and rattle 
Got a blue one for my daughter 
Not as advertised 
Ok product 
Not as advertised 
Pills 
Nice blanket 
Pills a lot! 
Disappointed 
An adequate travel system. 
Does the job 
Break Easily 
Works 
Great for transitioning off of bottle... 
Probably no worse than anything else similar 
Hard to open & close 
Have used for 11 months with first baby will not use for second 
good but leak 
Skeptical 
Meh. 
Okay 
Try another brand first but if it doesn't work try this one 
Opt for the glass ones 
Excellent.....until they start leaking 
Too many parts to clean 
good & bad... 
Leak and hard to clean 
System works... but get wide-neck! 
Didn't reduce spit up 
If you don't make sure to fill correctly they leak 
take forever to dry 
Wares out Quickly! 
Works consistently for a few months but then needs replacing 
Would have been better if it told me I wasn't drunk 
Toddler Helper 
Worked 
Decent product 
Wish I'd tried Munchkin 
Not as good as I thought 
They're too shallow. And they look rather cheap for Gerber. 
Ideally Good but not well balanced and the spoon is shallow 
nice but I don't think you can select the color assortment you receive 
Good product 
JUST OKAY 
Small 
Nice spoons 
I prefer the Ekstra style 
didn't work for me 
This is a fine swim diaper. But be careful in the car! 
Makes transitioning from the pool tricky but great colors! 
Quality construction has minor cons. 
It's okay....but not great. 
Its okay... 
our first failed attempt 
it's ok 
My son loves this swing but it could be much better... 
Cute swing but pretty useless unless you grow batteries 
No AC Adapter but Runs Forever on D.  Rather Loud. 
Great EXCEPT... 
Cute but needs some changes 
Cool but not used that much 
My 9 month old daughter likes it but... 
like don't love 
decent toy my daughter just doesnt care for it 
boring 
Mediocre 
Speaker on the bottom? 
Just wish it didn't have the foam head backing 
Mixed review depending on age 
Be careful during assembly... wobbly legs! 
Baby is happy but daddy is not 
We returned this 
Inexpensive booster seat 
Functional but easy to outgrow 
Love it - But Not Recommended by Experts 
too short 
Hard to release 
Not THAT hard to open 
Works great to lock your cabinets but quite a hassle to remove. 
They're OK 
Baby can peel these off really easily 
They peeled off pretty easily. 
Not so awesome 
Could be better 
just ok 
Okay for some foods 
Cute but motor is a little loud 
Just ok 
The turning mechanism makes a noticeably weird jerking motion each time the mobile turns while in motion 
Cute but loud 
noise with the rotation 
Not for sleigh cribs... 
Fussy baby likes it 
Higher review if it had worked when I received it 
Too small/ Not enough pockets 
Great for older kids not babies 
Functional but un-attractive 
Works ok 
Not available as lid only? 
great lid and replacement cover but silly sippy cup 
These are just the lids!!! 
$$$ for lids that fold too much 
I actually like the little nail files best... 
Lovely but Huge 
A little disappointed 
not comfortable 
Not for me 
I am not a sling fan anymore 
Good but not great 
Not an easy spout 
OK 
Adorable 
Never showed interest 
Okay toy not the best 
looks and feels OK to me but my baby doesn't like it somehow 
Crunch stuff moves in the wash 
Eh 
My Dog Loves It! 
Star teething blanket 
It's ok 
Comb Is Good Brush Too Soft 
I wish I liked it more... 
better options out there 
good value but certain drawbacks 
Everything is good but the toothbrush 
Pretty good but quality is not always consistent 
Doesn't cut it for me 
Just ok 
nice but size is small and I'd prefer that both arm straps open 
It is very warm and functional but only good for the first six to nine months 
good design but temperature guide seems off 
The mat works but could be dangerous. 
Does the job 
Cute but stinks and hard to keep clean 
No smell at all little small though and doesnt seem very comfortable 
Very cute but very flimsy 
Some instruments are more fun than others 
Im going to say okay 
Good if you don't have a dog 
This looks like a dog toy! 
Smells good!! 
Baby ignores it 
Baby seems to like this but worried about safety 
great 
better toy ball than teether 
Good size but too hard 
OK toy not the best teether 
Lifefactory Glass Baby Bottle 9 oz 
Great glass bottle poor venting 
my son choked 
Cap doesn't fit very tight 
Just okay 
May be great for other babies but ours pulled them apart every single time. 
Well not too sure 
Nice but too much flex 
This product is just okay 
The links don't link 
Basic links 
The separate from each other and toys. 
Not great 
links are links 
The rings come off easily 
Okay... 
Good Quanitity but really lightweight 
Attach all the things! 
Too heavy for my daughter to sleep with but it makes a great play mat! 
I expected more for the price 
Works as advertised but watch for scratchy edges 
Rubs my kid's skin 
for Booginhead and MAM pacifier combo users i recommend... 
Love the camo 
It's ok 
Good Pacifier Clip 
Too tight 
Works but... 
Pacifier Strap 
Clip is really difficult to unfasten from clothes 
Great quality except the metal part 
Satisfactory. 
Good Soothie Holder 
great idea if it wasn't damaged 
Just another baby accessory 
Used to be great... 
can potential hurt your finger 
Good sturdy clip but long cord 
Super handy for a while 
Initially loved it but the clip rusts? yuck! 
you can try did not work well for me... 
It's okay 
Great idea - needs to be water resistant 
OK but not used much 
Cute and engaging but with a design flaw 
Alright 
I just wish you could set different times. 
Fine for the price....a purchase not an investment 
I wish the waist was adjustable 
Very baggy but they work. 
Typical Plastic Pants 
Meh 
Wanted to love it 
Cute but falling apart already 
Cute but average quality and poor content 
It's Okay 
Wish it was bigger 
Basic ball 
Wish it came on a different cord 
Small pendant 
Not sure about it 
purchased for baby shower 
Meh 
So cute but defective (probably just mine). 
Not so entertaining 
Cute 
Not as Soft As Expected Not Worth the Money 
Smells weird 
SOLID rubber pacifier 
I wanted to like the pacifier but my daughter didn't! 
I really wanted to like this but.... 
baby didnt like it 
I love them... but baby doesn't. 
Just never takes 
Smell/taste is strong 
These didn't work for us 
nipple size is VERY small 
Nothing special. 
Disappointment 
Didn't work for my child 
just not for us 
Liked the idea but not the execution... 
Did not work for us 
Will or won't your baby enjoy this ? 
great idea design flaws (for my baby anyway) 
doesn't stay in... 
Great product but my baby didn't take to it 
Not bad not as good as expected 
Spill proof cup...really? 
Cute cup but leaks 
Multi-use toy expensive bleeds color smallest cup is of a dangerous size 
Our second seat 
Works... sort of.  Rather large given its target demographic 
good concept 
Nice idea...not so great in reality 
Didn't work for us 
Wish I liked it better... 
great stroller but could use some improvements... 
Terrible if you live in a city 
Good but not the best 
Great but eats up batteries! 
Cute idea but.. 
love it 
Great but weird length 
this thing is huge - would never wear it out in public 
Good bottle for baby - but oz markings are deceiving 
Leak out the bottom 
Great nipple shape and air control poor design 
Baby likes it but it leaks and its hard to clean 
Not living up to the hype 
Diaper Pail Lacking in Quality and Functionality 
Yes and then no... 
Big Baby Deuce still = Odor 
Keeps the stink in. Sort of. 
Find a more durable product...not this one 
Just fine but we just don't use it w/just 1 newborn baby 
It was good till it broke 
Don't like customized refills 
Overpriced plastic garbage bin.  Equally functional and lower priced options available. 
I don't know why people rave about this thing 
Only \Meh\ 
Had to Replace 
Good concept sloppy execution 
Still smells.... 
Durable and Works Well But Expensive to Use 
They keep breaking... 
Its a toss up. 
Works fairly well expensive. 
average diaper pail bit pricey for bags 
An Awkward Overpriced garbage can 
Keeps out the odors but refills are expensive 
Great....But Breaks Easily 
Smells... 
Needs to perform its duty better. 
Maybe there is no such thing as a \good\ diaper pail but this isn't it. 
Regular diaper genie is better and less expensive 
Pretty effective but not totally convinced 
Not plug-and-play 
Ok Baby Carrier 
Sleepy wrap is Boba wrap 
Strange contraption... just a long piece of stretchy cloth 
Too much material 
Easy to adjust but too hot 
More of a novelty than useful... 
It's okay 
Great for first purees but nothing past that 
Could use some simple improvements 
So-So Bath Toy 
Better for younger babies 
It is OK.... 
Still has mold potential. 
Nice toy very heavy 
Ok toy not as much fun as I had hoped 
Not as great as others say it is. 
Chep and functional 
Details to fix leaky problem 
It leaks. 
Always shows hotter than it really is 
Expected More 
potty training made easy!! 
Nice chart but way overpriced 
Cute. 
Baby likes having something to grasp; seems a little cheap. 
Cute 
Had high hopes but my child didn't love it 
Okay but the concept is lost.. 
ok bag but lots of drawbacks 
For the price I just didn't love it enough to keep it. 
Too big for me (even though I have twins) 
Really wanted to love it 
Heavy and tips 
Maybe a little too bendy? 
Great for a short period of time when baby is learning to use utensils 
too flexy & too small of a scoop 
This is not a blankie 
You need to \babysit\ this warmer to avoid overheating of the food 
It works ok but could be so much better 
Works great most of the time. 
Disappointed 
Works... But.... 
Philips AVENT Express Food and Bottle Warmer 
It's ok but it's hard but no timer??? 
It works but could be better 
Okay.... sometimes bottles take long time to warm and switch is in a inconvenient place. 
Simple Operations but No Timer or Auto-Off 
eh 
Fast but not not steady 
Wish it dinged when ready 
No automatic shut off 
It's okay but could be a lot better! 
Does the job 
Its ok...hard to tell when the bottle is ready 
Not Quite as Described 
Works fast but can overheat milk 
Does Its Job though has downfalls 
Did not use 
It's ok 
It's ok but I seem to overheat the milk easily 
Handy but Inaccurate 
There are simpler approaches 
Not Mom Friendly 
Does not live up to its hype... 
Better than Philips Avent Express one. 
Functional food warmer. Not well designed. 
Easy to use easy to clean but somewhat unpredictable warming. 
Does the job but with flaws 
Giving a 2nd try 
Quick Cleaning 
Works fine but I wish that they'd come out with BPA free version 
Its Ok 
Easy to use more work to maintain. 
Easy to use stand-alone sterilizer. 
Excellent sterilizer but for the fears about BPA toxicity 
Not poisonous (yay) but not very affordable either. 
Cute 
OK - but Sophie is better! 
I like it more than my daughter does 
Great shape and material but squeaker is annoying 
Not as good as Sophie... 
Nice but these don't warrent their price 
Not a teether for my baby but a great toy 
It is EXACTLY like a dog toy 
Sophie is much better 
Does not hold 1 cup of water.... 
LOVE it 
Good for accidents but will not hold much liquid 
Humm!! 
Doesn't stay put but good cover 
Doesn't hold a lot 
product not what it used to be 
bunches up in diaper 
Good product but not washable 
Meh 
We only use when out and about - they're very thin 
Not perfect but a helper for sticky poo 
Odd shape strange smell 
Work Great 
Liners 
Okay but too thin 
they are soft 
Not soft and a toilet clogger 
OK 
Not working for us. 
They work OK 
Does the job but prefer other brand 
Not for extra sensitive skin!! 
Good Price but Kind of Flimsy 
Use it for 0-3 months 
0-3 months old bibs 
For new baby only 
Good basic blankets 
could be softer and larger 
Not cotton 
Nice toy for young child to make noise with 
Love JJB this print is ok the material not as thick as older versions 
first came broken :( second was ok 
Not bad but.... 
Good pacifiers but don't glow in the dark 
It will suffice 
Great buy but found something better 
Would prefer not to have to line dry 
Does not work on \porous\ tile 
Not bad but doesn't always stay on the wall 
doesn't work on my tiles 
Battery information needs updating 
Looks fun but baby doesn't like it. 
Great product \flaw\ with new materials 
Eh... 
Requires 2 hands to open - not effective 
Cute Pattern; Not User Friendly 
Cute Not very functional. 
Cute but got pink for my boy 
Infant sunglasses 
Quite sturdy for a toddler but too small 
Odd Fabric 
It's ok... 
Don't buy this! 
Can't go wrong with Philips quality and price. 
Nice in many ways but not enough functionality and versatility for general use 
Doesn't stay cold very long 
Mixed feelings 
Pros and cons 
Definitely NOT a must-have but why not?!! 
The better one has mesh siding with snaps 
works but smells 
Terrible off-gassing but fits the Graco Snugride carseat + stroller frame 
Good product / bad smell 
Does the job... 
Ok for occasional use I would not use it daily as your only crib 
It's Alright... Original Looks Better 
Nice but not entirely as advertised... 
Pretty not a lot of coverage 
Great for the bedtime routine 
accidental purchase but I have an opinion on it 
Eats batteries No Adapter Cors 
Shrunk! 
Nowhere near as soft as i anticipated 
Thin 
There's nothing \sateen\ about it but it's not a bad sheet 
Great for the price 
Love the material but the elastic breaks too easily. 
Very soft! 
Soft- but... 
So soft but the elastic gave way 
Elastic breaks easily in washing machine; crib sheets do not wear well 
Son didn't like it. 
great at first but fell apart on first wash 
Nice Soft Sheets Bad Elastic 
Soft warm but poor quality 
Just ok 
Sort of like it... 
Not Happy 
ties are way too short 
Does the job 
Didn't fit my standard sized crib. 
I don't like how they lay in the crib. 
Too tall 
Worth the Price! 
Okay 
It's okay... 
Crib bumper 
Too small 
too tight! 
Cute and Soft Ok Quality 
\Ok\ 
It's a sheet... 
Good at first but not for long term use 
Very soft but shrinks a ton 
shrank after a while 
Carters Easy Fit Jersey Crib Fitted Sheet (White) 
Very soft but a really snug fit - especially after washing 
Soft 
I agree with other reviewers; expensive and poor quality 
Doesn't fit right 
A bit small for the pack n play mattress 
Looks nice but thin... 
not that soft 
okay but there are better options 
They are okay for smaller babies heavyweight 
Okay 
Cute but too small. 
Cardboard 
Adorable but fade quickly 
Thet are fine not awesome 
Very thin. Not double sided. 
Don`t Expect more 
Great for everything except swaddling 
Great for other uses but just okay for swaddling 
Love the design but they don't wash very well 
dont wash very well... 
Smells awful 
Cute pattern but weak thread count. 
carters 
It's OK 
Cute 
Nice sheet but it is pretty snug 
Okay for what it is but not needed 
Good and Bad 
Better the bag gets ruined than the seat... 
Poor quality but does the job 
You'll need accessories 
nightmare to install 
Very average 
Good for what it is and what it cost 
You don't need these. 
CUTE but a bit hard to install 
Colorful but not very functional 
Great pattern but not quite as nice as the rest of the chair 
Not what I expected.. 
Velcro has its downsides... 
My child takes it off his crib 
Bottle design is nice nipples are not. 
Good cup 
I like the idea.....baby DOES NOT 
Don't like the mesh 
Sizing is VERY large 
Good wearable blanket ... until the zipper malfunctioned! 
I had bad luck with the zippers 
It's a fine product but underused. 
doesn't fit right 
Does the job but not sure if needed 
OKay 
Bottles fall over 
Kinda sucks 
Ended up not needing it 
Does the Job 
Love the sheets but they fit small 
versitle but zipper doesnt hold up well 
Not as good as swaddle me 
zipper stuck! baby trapped! arm holes too small 
Not impressed - **edited** 
Two different styles of Halo swaddle sack 
Not as good as their fleece sleep sacks 
good idea but has some flaws 
Sleep sack is great swaddler can't be removed 
Did not work great with the swaddle attachment 
good quality 
Great blanket weak swaddle 
Like it but baby can get arms out too easily. 
Not the best 
Not the tightest swaddle 
Love the concept but... 
Not good enough for my Houdini 
Never used it 
Good only for short time 
Okay 
Stitching came apart after 1 wash... 
Did not work for my Baby but still worth a shot 
My baby wouldn't stay in it 
By the time my baby fit into this swaddling wasn't needed. 
Nicely made 
Great idea but has some design flaws 
It is alright for the price but the swaddle does not detach 
Grumble grumble stupid sleep sack 
Wish they were of cotton instead and had a better zipper 
Don't like the mesh 
Perhaps better suited for older toddlers 
so so... 
Weird handle 
A little too big 
Sturdy durable not so soft 
Nice material fit is off. Probably don't need if you have a good mattress. 
Expensive for what it is 
Not that great 
Does the job but blocks view 
Really big 
IT IS PRETTY 
Not my favorite 
Can take a beating but to many useless pockets 
Nice looking and decently functional but lots of issues 
I like it but... 
It is ok but nothing out of this earth. 
Great features but some major downsides too! 
Baby leg stuck 
Soft but not as good as Baby Soy 
Great bodysuit but could use a little improvement 
Not for long-bodied kids 
nice fabric.. 
Rail Cover 
Wish I'd Looked at Pinterest First 
Not waterproof! 
Didn't use it 
Overpriced 
ok 
Works as they should 
works pretty well 
Does the job 
Wish these had lasted longer 
helpful but not always well made 
Inexpensive but frays too easily. 
Not really a \must have\ item 
Decent 
Not so great 
Handy 
Good but not great 
Decent purchase 
Great for some toys 
OK but could be improved 
Good for toys not for sippy cups 
Good Enough... 
Great concept...but they get tangled easily 
Pretty good but don't expect perfection 
Very short and can easily be made cheaper 
Not impressive but its okay 
Not for Bottles or Sippy Cups 
Renaming as Secure SOME Toys. 
Better for lighter toys than sippy cups! 
Useful 
Does the job - Could be better 
Found it for half the price at Babies R Us! 
Got the wrong color puke green 
should be bigger should be able to stay seated on seat 
Could be better.. 
Good for a laugh! 
Kind of a Waste of Money 
REALLY plush (almost too much?) 
Good idea but didn't work for us. 
A bit heavy for travel 
Not a miracle bottle 
Good Bottles 
Okay but like Dr. Browns Wide better 
I don't see how this is better than my Avents 
for the price they shouldn't leak 
Baby seems to like them... 
Baby Bottles 
Okay 
Amazing bottles stupid size 
I love it but has serious safety issues. 
horrible smell from paint 
Not Great Not Awesome...Just Okay 
Trying cloth 
Great for newborn and not-yet-mobile babies 
They're OK but make sure your diapers are gauzy enough to snag. 
They don't work on receiving blankets. 
Good but do not love 
Just start with size 2 (toddler size) 
Works as expected 
Most features are great unfortunately one huge con... 
Assembly is a pain! 
NOT for the Uppababy Vista!

It works 
Nice but a bit big 
breast milk storage containers are too small. 
feeding set 
Storage bottles are the best part of this set 
Great for milk storage not for the bottles 
Great transition spout. 
Okay for a girl. 
Cute but not very inclusive of 1st year milestones 
useful but bland 
Not the drop in liners my fault for not reading description closely 
I prefer the dop in liners

Too firm for me 
A fail in our house! 
not as good as others 
was ok 
leaky but good price 
Like the Bottles. Dislike the Nipples 
great bottle but.... 
So heavy 
These don't come with a sealing disc 
I wanted so bad to love these 
bought because of plastic scare 
Love that these are glass at a great price 
Pricey but worth the money if it gets you inspired to organize 
wish it was bigger 
pricey 
Useful but overpriced 
Good sippy cup 
one of the better sippy cups 
Decent but not for my daughter! 
soft tip and handles would be great!

Could be better 
Beautiful but...

Great safety impractical for cleaning

Could be better. 
Good bottle not for us.

Prefer Other Products 
Noisy. 
Nice But Not the Best 
Not bad for the price 
Ok potty but seems a bit awkward for smaller toddlers 
May work for early training.... 
It does what you need it too 
Like the simplicity but too big of a straddle. 
No luck yet 
Ok 
It's REALLY cute but my daughter who is 33.5\ tall has difficulty sitting on this. 
Needs design improvements; forces child to straddle \eyes\ 
Not great... 
Was working at first 
It goes off by itself! 
Needs to be taller 
Adorable but too short 
I prefer the Rainforest Jumper 
Awesome mobile horrible battery life 
big design FLAW

When it works

Almost perfect 
Not a fan of this style

Not as durable as some 
VERY NOISY but the baby loves it!

It works MOST of the time 
Night lights might cause nearsightedness 
Good Concept Bad Design 
different kids like different things so i'll just do a design analysis 
Cute long battery life 
No more Velcro. 
fit was kind of funky` 
Great- if they stay on 
Velcro is easy but doesn't last 
ok but prefer other brands because of leakage 
The velcro is what kills it 
They are okay 
They do the job they just don't look cute doing it. 
It's OK... not great. 
Okay 
Needs better velcro 
Ok if you're looking for velcro 
Not the best product available 
Works well but retains smell

design flaw 
Pretty but flimsy 
Good value for the price

Monkey Hamper 
Sticks Well 
Doesn't stick to the table too well 
It's okay 
Suction isnt strong 
Entertaining but suction is bad and toy is removable from base 
suctions great but removed from base too easily 
Great idea bad suction. 
Not easy to clean and doesn't stay suctioned to tray 
The whole point was to have it stay in place! 
Fun toy and then there is the suction cup ... 
Baby likes 
Just good let me explain why 
Big and Smelly 
Great idea but flimsy. 
Very useful but not very durable. 
Needs to be Bigger

Good product 
The 4 oz size leaks 
good for feeding but they leak! 
Leaked all of my breastmilk into my bag. 
on defence 
Not the bottle for my baby 
Good but not for us 
Cleaning is a Pain 
Not my favorite 
They're good I guess... 
bottles are great but heavy flow nipples 
Bottles are fine but too many parts 
Not easy on/off; returning b/c needed easier access. 
Okay 
Seems fine but I don't use it 
Beautiful Highchair for (Small) Babies 
A little too thin 
more hassle 
Thin plastic like a stroller rain cover 
Works well not easy to store. 
Cheap material but it works fine on carpet 
this is a round piece of see through plastic and it looks cheap on the floor 
Good size and love non-color 
Not what I ordered but will do the job. 
Nothing fancy 
Strong smell 
It doesn't suck and that's the problem 
My son has fun but it doesn't stick

sorry! not the miracle sippy-cup replacement 
Your child will NOT be able to open this one 
doesnt fit 
Doesn't fit... But looks sharp 
Worked on 1 toilet not the other 2 
Looks Pretty but Doesn't Fit Toilet Well 
Fits only standard toilets. 
Good disposable cups.  Hole is too small. 
Too hard to drink from 
Can get clogged 
Great to have the screw on lid 
no different from my other bottles 
Liner is pointless changing pad is great 
Yellow Pad is really \Cornmeal\ 
Don't really need it 
Just OK. 
Ok but I wish they had a waterproof layer 
glorified washcloth 
Cute but not what I was hoping for.. 
So So 
Good quality 
Great product not enough sticky tape 
Requires better adhesive 
Functional but not very sightly. 
Just OK 
Great pad...

Cute but size didn't fit my need 
No Stickers! 
Way overpriced! 
Ok but hard to keep all the straps clean 
Great brush AWFUL soap dispenser!

Okay playard sheet 
Nice sheets but shrank on first washing 
Just barely fits my pack-n-play 
Very nice 
A little snug. 
A little big 
Good quality 
Nice organic product drab organic color. 
tight on pack n play 
Too soft 
OK 
It can be improved 
Edges curl after wash surface stays damp... 
NON- ORGANIC polyester layers small in width but good for mini bed 
Nice but shrinks 
Edges curl after wash surface stays damp... 
Beware they aren't white and they shrink... 
Organic... but made in China? 
Not 100% Cotton 
Very small 
Should be called the 1/4 sheet saver 
great other than the pillowcase 
Good size pillow but need a way to close the silky pillowcase 
Nice size but you can't wash it 
This is a super small pillow! 
More like a pillow for dolls... 
Great pillow but the case slips off too easily 
Tiny pillow even for a tot! 
Not a game changer 
runs big 
frustrating 
High quality padding could stay in place better and be easier to use with buckles 
okay for the money 
Super Cute 
Cute but came broken 
what we expected 
Cute but overpriced 
Doesn't really glow 
Not as Good as the Other Avent Pacifiers 
Love Avent pacifiers but the night time one does not retain its glow at all 
Backfired 
Great Avent pacifier horrible \glow\ pacifier 
Too long 
Avent Freeflow Paci 
Frustrated 
Every  baby is different! This may or may not be the right one!! 
Pacis yes!  Styles boo. 
Great size suction cups do not stick 
White not Blue 
served my purpose but may not be functional for most 
Received a different color than pictured 
handy 
Its ok...but not for sticking on the wall 
OK. Wrong color? 
doesn't stick to the wall that well 
Doesn't suction 
We made it work for us. 
Good holder doesn't stick to porcelain tile 
Doesn't hold great 
Have to Use Other Suction Cups 
Suction cups are a nightmare 
It's alright

Good product but.. 
Beware not made in USA

Not bad... 
Okay bottle many parts and big for little hands to hold 
These Leak 
Infant didn't prefer this type of bottle 
Won't buy again 
Great venting system but plastic scratches and extra work to clean 
Smooth flow but... 
Good bottle but slow slow flow 
not natural nipple-like 
Ended up being our least favorite bottles. 
baby does seem to eat more 
wide neck has been a drawback 
just okay 
Not the best for this price range 
Not for everyone 
I suppose I'll keep it 
It is Ok not as nice as I hoped 
Still like it but not as great as I first thought. 
Pretty and functional but won't last 
Review of purchase through Target only 
Not large enough & straps too short 
Love the design but falling apart at the seams! 
Fashionable with tons of storage compartments 
It's cute but wipe drys out 
Not very useful... 
Dries wipes!! :( 
Funny red slide 
Functional 
Red wipes door slides open... 
You get what you pay for 
This is on ok wipe holder 
Dry wipes 
It's cute but... 
ok 
Design I like 
Really thin 
Nothing special 
Different from picture 
Fits wide range of strollers but extra strap loops annoying 
Never got to use it like I wanted to 
Poor magnetic closure 
Not the best with the City Select stroller 
Good product. 
works OK 
Not good but not bad either 
does it's basic job but not thrilled with how it attaches. 
Purchased as a replacement 
Returned it 
Areas for improvement. 
Looks nice/ very warm/ but zippers too close to eyes. 
Great warm cover for Chicco Keyfit 30 but works best for smaller babies 
For small babies 
this will do the trick 
great device but cleanup can be tedious 
Nice but not necessary 
Never used 
Please taste the water after it went through a  cooking cycle. 
So very close but not quite there 
Very easy to use but there is no sound indicator. Unsightly stains :( 
Expensive for what it is 
Not for Outdoor 
Almost a homerun 
Small but nice 
Great concept toddler didn't care for it 
It's OK 
Just OK for 2 year molars 
Such a weird design...still uncertain 
Ehhh he could take it or leave it mostly leave it 
Son won't use it 
It's okay 
My son didn't take to it 
Good idea but baby not Interested 
Great idea but baby did not go for it 
Good suction too many parts great short-term solution. 
For the price not bad. 
Not bad for the price 
Splurge and get yourself something better.

upset 
It's fine.

Great while it lasted 
Decent quality but much too short in length 
Too big.

not great 
matching blanket 
Nice for a small pillow 
Slightly disappointed 
Good bedrail. 
Very cool feature; some glitches 
Great monitor but... 
Expensive and Lackluster 
Decent Gate 
Not asymmetrical - didn't work for us 
good gate but misleading description 
Not incredibly sturdy 
Good but... 
It did the job but barely 
Eh not a big hit 
Smells good and soft on babys gums 
They're okay. 
Small and easy to hold 
Expected much more from Vulli products 
Not interested 
Good for the money 
Fits Great but really hard 
good for swimming 
Sizing seemed a little off 
Good for home use only 
Nice 
Nice product but too small for me. 
Cute and functional! 
Stain Easily 
babykicks 
great wipes but the tag is annoying 
soft and comfy but leak through when used over night 
ok for use at home 
Pretty good 
okay but prefer their 'fleece' ones 
They work but I've used better 
Absorbent but don't use Snappi fasteners! 
absorbent but not for small newborns 
Good and bad 
Really expensive.... we ended up using them sparingly 
good prefolds but don't work well with the snappis 
Absorbent but they shrink. 
absorbent but shrink 
I dont know 
Take em or leave em 
Doesn't hold much liquid 
Not Sure What I'm Doing Wrong 
Too wide for baby. 
These work..but they are very bulky 
Works well but leaves lint 
Fantastic for 2 years 
Updating from 5 to 3 stars - 2 main issues... 
Good but will interfere with Wi-Fi 
Monitor fine but Wi-Fi interference is a deal killer 
Not quite as plush as i thought... 
Bumper not as pictured :( 
Good 
Ok 
Not a fan 
happiness that was short lived 
Tray useless seat is ok 
My baby loves it but can't stay in it for too long 
Not so great 
what one child loves.. 
Not that bad 
it's OK but i returned it 
Super Seat 
Better than Bumbo 
the tray isn't too stable 
Good seat 
Summer Infant vs Bumbo 
Great as a chair for babies learned to sit up 
It's okay. 
A little disappointing 
Meh. It's ok 
good for the price 
Works but can be Dangerous 
Pricey not perfect but gets the job done. 
Wary of smell 
Liked these but found others I like better...... 
Good product but make sure it fits your bed 
Shrunk when I washed it 
Barely Gets the Job Done... 
Nice big bag but flimsy hardware 
Not as nice as expected 
Okay slipcover 
Works just fine 
Not very soft 
Nice cover right price wrong pattern 
Rough Thin Synthetic Fabric 
Not soft! 
Rougher fabric 
Not very soft 
Boppy cover 
It's simple and pink 
It's kinda scratchy. 
nice colors thin cover 
Not great! 
Cute not soft 
Doesn't help fix flat head just prevents it. 
much smaller than I thought 
Perhaps it depends on the baby but mine would fuss the moment I laid her on this... 
It's okay but recommend Mimos pillow 
So Far So Good 
My baby didn't like it 
Cannot be used for elder baby who moves a lot 
Don't want to give a star rating but... 
I use this pilllow every day but baby still has a flat head 
It's ok 
Great but not for carseat?? 
It's alright... 
smaller than anticipated 
Super small and uncomfortable 
Not sure if it is working.... 
Good product but make sure it is what you are looking for. 
I expected more!! 
Recommend for smaller heads 
HORRIBLE NIPPLE 
Too complicated 
why no replacement straws? 
not a cup for promoting independence 
Why doesn't Amazon let me specify a color? 
Definitely NOT the best 
Great sippy cups but read fine print. 
Too short. 
Maybe not for infant seats? 
Returned 
Too small 
Item Not The Same As Pictured Or Described 
Cute doesn't get a lot of use 
Ok not perfect 
it is probably a great product for most spaces 
Two stars off: advertised age specs are rubbish. 
Does what it needs to do 
A couple of minor issues... 
Works but small opening 
Gaps 
Eh 
Decent product 
not ideal 
Didn't work for us 
To the toddler Gandalf says \You shall not pass!\ 
Description is a little misleading 
Does NOT fit openings up to 40\. 
Decent for the price 
It's OK... 
Measure right... the gate is smaller than you think 
It's okay 
Nice 
Works great in narrow spaces with young children. 
Babies can open the gate! 
Didn't fit our space 
Not all that great. 
Decent for the price 
Not one-handed. 
Great price will do the job 
Serves its purpose 
Go with North States Supergate instead 
Great in theory 
works 
Got this to replace one I used for 1 year 
Decent gate. 
Its ok 
Just Okay... 
Alright but not Hard for Toddler to Learn to Open. 
Easy to install and use even for a two year old 
Does the job. 
Did an okay job 
Good but only good for narrow space 
Not great but not terrible 
Not bad if you get a good price 
Maybe ok for animals not that great for kids not necessarily pressure mounted 
Kind of short for a \super wide\ 
Cheap but Effective 
Great Latch Pressure mount could use work 
Does the job but could be more sturdy 
5 Stars for function minus 2 for a safety concern 
Serves it's purpose. 
Flimsy but works. 
Good cheap gate for a NON BUSY part of the house 
Great if narrow 
cheaply made missing pieces but easy to install 
It's Okay 
not for us 
you get what you pay for 
Just okay 
Ok but not great 
Does not very well. 
Its a bit flimsy but it serves its purpose 
Though it fit it was too stretched to be functional. 
A good option for those with pets 
Not my favorite 
Fine for certain situations 
Cute but some flaws 
Bought twice for both my kids more expensive second time 
My son likes it 
still needs some tweaking 
Simple Car Mirror 
This thing is ok but I wouldn't buy it again 
Great to Have But Doesn't Fit All High Chairs 
Gets the job done 
Covers the high chair. May not work with seat belts 
gets the job done 
Just okay 
Mat is small 
Just \alright\ 
Hot material 
BULKY HEAVY HOT POOR INSTRUCTIONS 
LOVE only for carrying a car seat -NOT FOR LATER USE 
Great and not great... 
Generally a good system if you don't use mass transit 
Mixed feelings about this stroller 
This stroller is okay 
Nice stroller don't leave it in the car. 
a little disappointed 
A little costly but the product itself is ok 
I could select just one color 
Works well but has drawbacks 
It isn't the best choice. 
First one: DAMAGED; Second one: a KEEER! 
Cherry color expect it to arrive damaged 
Nice crib but arrives with some damage 
Pictures a bit deceptive 
Awkwrad Height 
Good idea but I don't use it much. 
So far so good 
Great in Theory - I just hope it's working! 
Not Worth the Worry? 
I think it works? 
Not sure it's working 
Flimsy small and functionally suspect. 
Goes through batteries quick no way to verify 
Cute but not the most popular shower gift 
Clever but other products are cheaper 
A handly little sterilizer for the germ-phobic 
Battery Gobbler 
Not good for boys might work for girls. 
OK but has some issues. 
love the idea but 
works 
Use this if you don't need in the cabinet 
Keeps everyone out! 
Not a Fan 
Waterproof but still leak through to clothes 
Get the car seat cover instead! 
Washed and ripped 
nice product but prefer the heavier weight bundle me. 
Baby still cries 
Tried on my toddler but he hates it 
It works okay my kid still hates it. 
Eh It's ok 
Ehh 
aspirator 
im 50/50 
didn't work for us 
Just Okay 
Hmmm? 
Works ok but try the Zo-Li On-The-Go Travel Formula & Snack Dispenser instead. 
Somewhat flimsy 
Nice try but... 
Not bad for our toddler boy 
it is average 
Hard to use. 
A mixed bag. 
Both Good and Bad 
one leaked but the brand is good 
Not good for all babies 
I want to love this bottle but it has a major flaw. 
Not as great as I had hoped 
Still too fast a flow nipple 
Good idea but these are leaky 
Not As Great As I Hoped 
Helped with tummy time... a little 
My baby didn't take to it 
Noise Bomb 
Son likes toy better than me 
So-so 
Cute idea but kind of hard to squeeze 
It is too hard for a baby to squeeze. 
Kind of works for a 2 year old 
Haven't found anything like it! 
great use but not for their purpose 
Looks great not as functional as it could be 
pretty good 
Wheels don't work on carpet. 
Great until they start getting around 
Lacks Medium Flow Nipples 
Not as modest as I thought 
Baby still gets hot underneath 
Nice cover but hard to get on 
Get the latest cover instead 
Does its Job 
Snoogle Cover 
Seems ok 
Didn't do what I hoped but not bad 
Handy for travel but a hassle long-term 
bottles great liners suck 
Decent product but didn't like it enough to switch. 
I didn't notice a difference 
No air but still messy. 
Happy with the bottles but I did not get the bottles that are pictured. 
It's OK but would Supplement for gift 
Great for travel 
Sticking with Playtex non-drop ins ! 
Whatever you do DON'T BOIL 
Went back to regular bottles 
Nice Little Gift Idea 
These work great but be careful about temperature 
Decent Bottle Set 
To much for replacements 
Useful? For some people. Premium? Not so much. 
nice idea 
Lid isn't great 
Needs a better design 
Cute stickers but doesn't sticks very well 
Great design but very weak adhesive 
heavy toys pull off wall 
shape becomes distorted and as a result it will no longer stay suctioned 
Doesn't Stick 
Suction cups don't work in our bath 
Doesn't hold up after washing 
Grows mold! 
it's ok but it's the only travel wipe warmer I could find. 
Works great but only if plugged in 
Loved it in the beginning 
Came apart quickly 
Travel wipes warmer 
Great concept...cheap product 
A little too bulky for diaper bag. 
Thought this was an unnecessary luxury. I was WRONG. Great customer service. 
I'll take the good with the bad 
Keeps wipes warm is too bright 
it's ok 
A little damaged 
love and hate 
a luxury 
Good wipes warmer but cord broke after a year of use. 
Good but... 
Nice if it works 
Wish I had gotten colors 
Great concept not as visually stimulating 
Has some unknown sealant over the wood; baby never looks or touches it 
Baby doesn't care for it 
Not the Best Rattle Out 
Just ok ball 
Okay Ball 
Good concept but doesn't work well 
It doesn't suck it sucks 
Ok Product 
My baby not a fan 
Cute but not comfortable for me or baby 
Good but could use work 
Cute. 
2 Year old's favorite. 
Leak Proof but hard to clean 
Good concept but not has so many flaws 
OK But these Leak Easily 
It really depends on what you are looking for 
Adorable but VERY CHEAP design 
Flimsy but does the job 
Way Cute Way Expensive 
Not very useful but ever so cute 
Guard is great adhesive is horrible 
Great looking. Not very useful 
One serious design flaw when folding the G stroller with panniers attached and \closed\. 
ok 
Fall apart easily. 
Fragile but not impossible 
My son loves it I love it but be warned for the quality! 
Awesome... Till it broke 
Great Until It Died!  Now No Longer Available From Manufacturer! 
Fun but broke fast 
Best Bath Toy So Far! (UPDATE: oops......it broke) 
Tons of fun but sucks up batteries 
Fun toy for bath time 
Fun product - jury is out on quality... 
My son loves this! 
Cute Product- Impossible Packaging 
Protect furniture from leaks! 
Not Great for Cloth Wipes 
General review for wipe warmers 
Musty sometimes but still a good warmer. 
Heating part stopped working after 9 months 
Worked Fine but Never Used It 
Worked great until it stopped working 
Decent for a second carseat 
Safe seat compact size fun colors but difficult to use 
very cute but not of much interest to my 6 month old 
Weak Bell 
its okay but cheaper out there... 
Average 
Alright 
This is way too big for a first snack cup 
Very large opening is a stretchy fabric material 
Nice but too big 
Snack trap vs Munchie Mug 
meh.. 
Cute Idea - But! 
Not worth the price 
oversized... 
Loved it initially but it's going on the shelf until they're a little older 
Great if you like the padded shoulder 
good Product 
still learning 
Too hard to get the hang of for my taste... 
Not For Me 
Hmm 
It's ok 
This works for what I needed. 
Very cute but not too spill proof 
Not for me... 
Useful 
It's OK 
Okay but annoyingly long 
Adequate protection 
Isn't smoke colored it's clear 
It guards the stove but I have other issues with it 
Too rough! 
Just OK... 
Good that it is organic but very thin 
NOT SURE IT IS WORTH THE MONEY 
It works 
ehhh 
keeps kid safe...but hard to open 
Would not lay flat against the wall 
Its ok but the latch piece is inadequate 
Not bad 
Bulky and kind of low quality 
Best product I've found but not perfect 
Great...but 
Great while it lasted 
great idea 
Way bigger than it appeared 
Worth it if you need an extra once or two 
Good idea... 
Give it a few weeks to see if you really need it 
Huge! 
Good idea steep price 
Serves its purpose 
Ok if you really need it 
Not that useful as an exclusive pumper 
Good idea but kind of useless after the first weeks 
Great product but didnt really entertain my daughter 
Eh... 
Holds up for about 2 months 
Very nice material.  Zipper needs improvement though. 
Nice product but better to choose other prints. 
Great material fit not so great 
It tears but still works 
it's pretty but.... 
Only one packet - WAY OVERPRICED 
Still on the fence 
Ok wrap just never took to it 
Not for me 
Im sure this works for some 
Not for forward facing 
Not as functional as the other style 
Lid should come off 
so so 
depends on what you use it for 
Wish I'd Spent More 
Just OK and stopped working for a short while. 
Too many issues 
Very good if.... 
Not what I needed but very good product nonetheless 
Cost doesn't outweigh the benefits 
Enormous 
Boon saucer - works fine as a divider plate doesn't prevent baby from picking up 
Too small 
Slip-resistant but NOT flip-resistant 
What I need but not the best quality 
Good but smaller than BG 4.0 
I only use it when I run out of all my other diapers 
Could be better 
Good as occasional seat not great for twins 
it would outgrow 
Sort of meh but it works. 
useable 
slides around on table never used strap but sturdy and worked well enough 
It works... 
Look for another changing table pad 
Made in China - but serves it's purpose ;-) 
Summer Infant Changing Pad 
*REALLY* tight fit for the IKEA Sundvik changing table 
May not fit your changing table 
Good changing pad for a long time 
You get what you pay for. 
No necessary. 
Decent product but too big 
. 
love the belt 
Good enough for me 
Be Prepared to Need to Off-Gas This Thing 
It does what it supposed to do 
Good size and does the job should be cheaper 
Smells 
This thing is HUGE 
It's large! 
Smells awful 
Hard to clean... Don't use without a cover. 
Functional and easy to clean - installation is silly 
A little awkward 
Um it's ok 
Durable and cute but... 
Bendy Ball 
Uninterested 
Great ball but poorly named 
Baby doesn't like this toy 
okay 
Maybe Better for Younger Babies 
Not the same toy now than what I bought in 2009 
Too heavy 
It is well Made 
More suitable for older babies 
it's ok 
Never really held interest 
It's OKAY 
good and bad 
Good product 
average quality item 
cute.. maybe cuter for me than the baby 
Pretty good 
Disappointing for Baby Einsten 
Smaller than expected. . . but it's a bendy ball 
My nine months old enjoyed it for one minute really 
Very cute... but my 6 month old didn't care. 
Its ok 
Hard 
OK 
SO SO 
Not Very Bendy. 
Durable fun ball for baby! 
Interest level will very depending on baby 
Mediocre 
My daughter doesn't enjoy this as much as I had hoped 
Don't hate..but don't love it. 
Hazardous but my son loves it... 
eh it's okay. 
Small but cute 
nothing amazing... but maybe I'll appreciate it more when he gets a little older 
it's okay 
I don't see whats so great about this thing 
Its okay. 
I recommend a round regular ball. 
pretty good 
For a little extra room. 
Basic net... 
It's Okay 
Cute But not high quality 
hard to transition 
Can't Choose Color Baby Not A Fan 
... exactly what i was looking for but theyre not bad did get a girly color even though i ... 
okay... 
Awesome cups Anoying you can't choose colors. 
Good size for small hands but terrible spout 
Lid hard to line up 
Great cup 
Generic packaging 
Packaging is suspicious 
Broke after 3 months of use 
Slightly reduced power but works 
This is an OEM product 
It works 
Didn't specify voltage 
Stopped working after about 4 months. 
Great Price 
Packaging or product arrived with a strong floral scent 
Yes they do what they say but good luck getting them on 
Twin Mom in VA 
Great Idea but really hard to suck milk through 
Love the idea... 
Neat idea but hard to use 
Didn't work as expected 
not absorbant 
Decent Item - Nothing Amazing 
\Plush\ eh? 
Just ok.. 
Just okay 
Easy to pinch thighs in buckle 
Cute but not so sturdy secure 
Daughter never used it. 
Very Big 
Ouch 
no slip grip that bums me out 
My son loves Mickey so he wants to use the ... 
cute.. but only for 1 meal option 
No instruction sheet pilled after one wash! 
Great for Newborns Not for Bigger Babies 
Not the size depicted but can be pumped up 
Cute but not great 
Easy to keep clean 
Sort of does the job 
Trouble fitting on our older faucet 
Looks cute but.. 
Didn't really work 
Cool spout cover... but... 
Works fine but gets moldy! 
Will not work without a diverter!! 
Just OK 
Does The Trick 
Only stays on with shower pull! 
suitable for avoiding possible nasty collisions 
Three Stars 
Pretty Good but... 
Wanted to love it just doesn't work for us. 
Good idea doesn't work on my tub 
Doesn't stay on but is very cute 
Sort of what I needed 
1 year old can easily remove from spout 
Cover works but duck has hard protruding beak 
Fits loose on my spout... 
Cute but cheap 
Very cute 
It's ok 
Not good with short spouts 
Pricey for what it is 
Great if it fits right. Clearly not a one size fits all! 
Doesn't really work on extremely narrow spouts 
It works 
Why can't we choose our own colors? 
I'm torn.... 
Don't see (feel?) much difference 
Good if you have large nipples 
Wish they were softer 
Didn't work for me but the product is solid 
Great concept - very uncomfortable though. 
Didn't find them comfortable 
OK to help with pain from contact but not very practical 
Nothing Special 
Small hole 
Medela SoftShells Breast Shells For Sore or Inverted Nipples 
No thanks 
Works but troublesome 
Good bottles but leak 
Love the look 
Good if they help your baby with spitup/gas otherwise just a lot of extra cleaning 
Not the best out there for all colic cases. 
Great bottle- A lot of Parts 
ok 
i guess it's ok 
Rainbow mats are nice-but possible over-priced due to thickness 
Does the job but needs some fiddling 
Short 
Not as protective as I'd hoped 
Not bad but hard to fit 
Quality control 
3.5 stars 
Does Its Job But Smells Terrible 
if you can spare the money but not necessary. 
Does the job 
Very large! 
Covers rail but does not cushion 
Thin covering smelled for days 
over priced but it works 
Manufacturer Description??? 
The price is great! The size is not. 
another suboptimal solution 
They break 
it's good BUT 
Whether it works for you really depends on your breast/nipple type 
Dimensions provided are for the inner tube not the cup 
Picture is misleading but works alright. 
Low price = Low Quality Thirsties are better 
Ok 
An okay toy with not much to it. 
TImer is WAYYY too short 
Baby likes it but I don't 
Eh... 
good bowl but still made in China. 
Not bad for a door knob lock 
Worked for 6 months 
Varies By Door Knob Size/Shape 
Very comfortable not really absorbant 
Seems like a good idea... 
Not impressed so far with leashing my twins. 
and is said i would never use a harness... 
Just ok for my 18-month 
a little too small 
Replacing this before 7 months 
Non-Skid? 
Received Damaged Product Twice 
Change tables are good but this is basic 
Started out great... then not so much.. 
Good product 
Worked the purpose 
Very Cute But Buttons Kept Coming Undone 
Nto crazy about it 
ripped after two washes 
Not soft 
Ok sheets 
Good enough for Grandma's house 
Endlessly useful 
Great but not needed 
Leaks.... 
1 year old dislikes it but it is a great cup from my perspective 
Just okay 
Not easy to use 
5 stars for no-spill 1 star for shape 
too bulky 
Just Okay 
I know this is politically incorrect...... 
Bottom of cup too big for average cup holders 
but I do like the flexibility of the hanger 
INEXPENSIVE BUT RECOMMEND BUILTNY CASE 
Hard to open 
Ok 
Just ok... 
Definitely not for two pacifiers 
A little smaller than expected. 
Ok 
great plate with one major design flaw... 
Kind of small 
Great concept not for every baby 
crappy lid 
Nice and easy 
Gets the job done but not a good value 
OK but there are other less expensive options 
Works well but I've found a small conatiner that I like better... 
Wanted this to work 
Just alright 
Very soft sounds 
Fair buy. 
Very quiet 
Not loving it 
Step up from Graco but not sure it's \the one\ 
Didn't Work for Us 
Great idea but my daughter didn't think so 
I really wanted to love it&#8230; 
Woombie Swaddler 
Runs Small 
A little flimsy but serves purpose 
Doesn't hold baby's attention 
I like it more than the baby did 
Very cute 
Stuffing coming out... 
Skip Hop VS. Tiny Love 
Cute but sheds 
Large did the job 
Cute but the giraffe one works better

My 2nd wubbanub. 
you need two 
Not What You Expect For the Money 
Frustrating for baby 
Very quiet and not safe for the older babies crib. 
very fun toy for baby 
Cute Idea 
Just Okay 
My son didn't take to this.. 
Too quiet 
I returned 
Too quiet kind of cheap 
Great if you deck it out with other toys. 
toy 
It's okay but my son loves it. 
Disappointing 
Ok but not great 
Returning it 
ocean sounds are soothing 
Simple yet effective 
Cute but only rocks 
So-so 
Would be great if it worked 
Pump is okay but not for me. 
decent for the price 
Not as big as i thought 
ok nothing great 
Cute Tote for Baby 
Hard to manually express/compress in this bra 
not for me 
Works well enough but don't love 
Nice to have but not necessary 
feels like the pumps will fall off (but they never have) 
Wasn't very comfortable for me but quality material. 
for my wife 
Good but you dont need it. 
size large is HUGE 
Just okay - not tight enough 
Doesn't really act as a bra but does hold the flanges in place (36DDD wearing L/XL/XXL) 
Does not hold well once you have some weight to those bottles 
You really don't need it. 
Good if you need it 
Returned it 
Difficult to take on and off 
more trouble than it is worth for me 
Does the job but not as useful as I hoped. 
works well not flawless 
holds flanges on by pressing against chest 
Dont waste your $$$ 
No lo necesitas realmente... 
It's just ok 
Does the job but stretches out. 
This is just okay 
Not for me 
inaccurate sizing 
Take It or Leave It 
Didn't really use it. Turns out I need to ... 
Not used as much as I thought just pop in your nursing tank instead 
Mixed Emotions 
Disappointed 
Fan is just \ok\ 
They're OK but Wishing I Got Something Else 
inexpensive- but doesn't last long 
Good but too small 
Draw string issues 
talk about large try 8x12 in. (piece of paper size)....what is small or medium 
Perfect as the \just I case bag\ for the diaper bag 
Good For Occasional Use 
Fine except for drawstrings 
They work 
Work well at first but don't wear well over time 
Just OK 
They are not my favorite 
What's in a wet bag? 
My son Loves it 
Good toy would like to be able to use music w/out the motion and vice-versa 
Fairly good entertainment for young babies annoying music 
Not sure about the spinning motion 
Seemed like a great idea but son wouldn't use them 
Beautiful product but he didn't like them 
Awkward angle 
Smaller than expected but seems to work. 
Seems to have an odd fit. Doesn't really wrap ... 
Works but kinda thin. 
Good for little kids not as good for big kids 
wears fast 
You get what you pay for. 
Nice but hurt my back 
PLEASE read this... 
nice crib but don't count on it being 4-in-1 
Crib is pretty good but does have a chemical smell when received 
Pretty and compact design but difficult to turn 
Mostly perfect. 
Will NOT fit (3) Avent Natural bottles... 
Perfect for bottles but nothing else 
Doesn't fit 3 Playtex Nurser Drop-Ins 
Nice until you get a hole in the ice pack 
Cooler for EBM 
strap broke 
Good fun but slightly poor quality 
Wish it worked! 
OK be ready for the light rattling 
sunlight is bad for retaining straps 
I love Munchkin products 
Its okay 
Needs some modifications to be great... 
NOT Made in USA 
It is pretty. 
Next time I'd get one with drawers 
Can't expect too much in terms of quality for this price. 
Looks beautiful but the drawers don't open very far 
Decent quality but not all solid wood 
drawers don't pull out far enough 
I thought this would be the one... Nope! 
Love the concept wish it was better quality material! 
Not good for babies under 1 year 
Major Cuteness Factor & Somewhat Decent Quality 
Well-made and stylish...but small. 
Its decent 
The footprint is nice but there isn't a great spot to put ... 
It's cute enough 
If I coul go back and get a new one I might 
This book is okay but since I've purchased it I've seen better. 
Nice baby book with printing error 
Daughter Didn't Like It 
just ok 
First solids bib fail 
Nice idea but my son hates it 
It's okay 
I liked the idea baby hates it 
Too small for 7 month old 
Not for self feeders 
Not a great design 
Not as practical as I thought 
Ok but a pain to clean and not a great fit w the Inglesia Chairs. 
Cool idea and look but not very accurate 
Cool but not much useful 
It's just ok 
Not accurate 
Cute but not exactly what we expected 
A Bit Disappointed 
It's New and Improved...but Not Quite There Yet 
Not the best high back booster 
Not great replacement for the toy I hought it for 
Styles May Vary is right! 
Decent for the price 
You get what you pay for. 
Pretty small

They serve their purpose 
Good for Burping but not to Swaddle 
Thin but useful 
Cute but fair quality 
Hum.. 
Blanket

materials seem cheap 
Its ok 
Does not hold attention 
Not as great as I expected 
Just okay--has issues 
does the job 
Clamp not so durable 
Sort of fits my Britax carseat 
Cute but...not stable! 
keeps my daughter entertained 
Entertaining BUT broke in 4 months 
still not sure 
It's just okay 
Misleading Description but otherwise... 
Just OK 
Acceptable for Price 
Doesn't hold very well 
not for tall babies 
Not impressed 
Good Product 
Very cute 
Colorful mat but needs more to do... 
Eh... Should've saved my money 
A basic yet functional beginner playmat for smaller budgets 
So cute BUT... 
cute but looks cheap 
cool 
Adorable and well-made... but too small for a folder 
Be aware of size 
Not for us 
Works fine but the toys are the main attraction! 
Solid but has flaws. 
Great Product 
One good one bad 
Not sure why there are so many fantastic reviews - this is just OK. 
Unfortunately it's necessary sometimes. 
BEWARE the plastic isn't clear at all! 
works but doesn't look great 
The sounds didn't work for our baby 
good giraffe 
Nice but we like the Sleep Sheep better 
Poor fit good product 
Lock doesn't work well 
Serves it purpose but not the highest quality 
So so 
Nice chair but a lot smaller than I thought! 
Good 
Cheap = poor quality 
Arrived folded in half 
OK 
Too thin in my opinion 
Runs big 
it's cute 
Would be great except for the handles... 
Not What I Expected... 
Does not prevent willful children from biting the rails 
Not as well designed as front rail cover 
One toddler likes it; one hates it 
Offers great protection when travelling but VERY tight fit 
Meh 
Not Fabulous 
it leaks 
Great Sippy but has a design flaw 
Good but 
Nice that it is metal but... 
Not more than just ok 
Baby LOVES it but may be a choking hazard... 
Great Cover 
It's okay 
Okay 
good thought... 
I have a hard time cleaning this 
A little stiff 
won't fit over a pnp mattress topper MUST drip dry 
Affordable padding. 
Just OK novelty wore off quickly 
Decent for the price 
Great large rattle other two toys are boring. 
Unnecessary! 
Color Fades After Just One Wash 
color misleading no dimensions info 
You get what you pay for... 
Great colors 
watch the price 
Okay. 
Cute but doesn't work 
Just OK 
It's OK but.... 
It works but it is sort of useless 
Some design problems 
Not Assured 
great bottle don't like the extra piece 
Not all that happy with them 
Decent bottles but I like the Avent Natural bottles better 
No problem with leaks but nipple design not the best for my newborn 
Good but there are better options 
They Leak 
Just OK 
My son loves them Im eh... 
Too fast if breastfeeding and... 
a little too fast 
Is NOT one inch thick 
It'll work 
Very cute but some uneven tiles. 
Tadpoles Playmat Set 
Comes apart easily too thin 
Not as soft but goes well with decor 
It's decent 
Very large 
Nice plates tripled in price!!! 
Maybe for older kids/babies 
To big to be portable 
Okay 
Freezer Tray Cleanliness 
Chemical smell after a few uses 
Needs a lid 
Its ok 
Not that great 
Not so good 
Its ok! 
Check the pacifiers carefully before giving it to your baby! 
Good backup 
Easy come easy go.... 
Like not love 
Thought I Would Use This More Than I Do 
Not much of a grinder at all 
suction doesn't work well 
Not very useful 
Suction holds for some time keeps things warm 
wish this had a lid 
Green Sprout Plates 
What was all the fuss about? 
OK. Needs a suction cup on the bottom 
Not very efficient 
Scratchy Velcro 
Really? 
ok 
Cheap and inexpensive 
not what i expected 
Useful 
Cute Bib large neck hole 
Great diaper cover but get snaps and not velcro 
review sizing 
It's the Velcro my dear Watson 
Like Snaps better 
threading came apart after one month 
Cute & does the job but needs a few fixes 
Great print but aplix didn't last 
Doesn't Leak 
Trim fit. 
fits good for a day cover. 
velcro does not secure after only 3 months 
Not as good as size 1 duos or sized thirsties 
Definitely doesn't last until 18 lbs 
Leaks! 
Eh 
Cotton/hemp 
Pretty good not great 
I rate them just 'okay' for my needs... 
These take forever to dry! 
absorb a lot but are very small 
Not great not terrible. 
too much odor 
OK for daytime use meh for nighttime. 
Buy the bigger hemp 
eh. could take it or leave it 
okay 
Not a pocket insert 
Okay 
So-So 
Not for kids under 3 years old! 
Decent for the price. 
Good Overall but Small 
a little small for kids 
They do the job 
Some mats only had 3 sticky sides! Argh! 
Not sticky enough 
Useful but offers no variety and difficult to peel and stick 
Not what I expected and depends on your child 
Not use very often 
Too tight 
Wish I had tried this when baby was younger 
Nice product baby doesn't agree 
Just OK 
Brush is Okay Comb Sucks 
Saves Space 
Great idea bad adhesive 
Eh this is just okay. 
Bought This for the Leg Room 
idea is great but not always compatible with food 
Great concept but 
Food color does not go away 
It's ok 
not comparable to PIS 
Not bad.... 
Color misleading 
Looks great until lid falls in 
just okay 
Ok but overpriced 
Super cheap but does the trick 
Darker Color 
Modern and Clean 
Looks nice but pretty flimsy 
Prefer to spend the money on boon 
Soft and small for baby but not great. 
Needs better fastner 
Wanted to like it. 
Perfect for spoon-fed babies. Nightmare for self-feeders 
Island highchair- you need lots of space 
I wish this would have worked on an island 
It definitely has its pros and cons. 
Bummed Out 
Good seat but there are better options 
Wanted to love it but it has a few design flaws 
Won't be reaching for these... 
Alot to wash doesnt do much for keeping out the air 
was great at first now not so great. 
Great design but not for everyone 
Really wanted to love it but couldn't and neither did baby 
Save your money 
A+ customer service 
good idea average result 
I loved the MamaRoo; but my baby didn't... 
Had high hopes... 
Great Product Not for my baby 
Good but expensive for long term use 
Seems a waste 
We didn't use the extra filters yet 
Cute backpack useless \leash\ 
Good buy 
Looks good could use more padding. 
Heavy - better on its own than in a bag 
Child's legs get stuck in the rails. 
knotted toy 
I wish my baby liked it 
Baby not interested 
Thinner than expected 
Super cute.....not that functional 
Wanted to love 
He never used it! 
Just OK as a teether... 
Not bad 
Returned 
Decent organizer 
As a diaper caddy... 
Cute by small! 
Functionable...I guess 
I really wanted to love this caddy =( 
I Like it 
small and flimsy 
Too thin 
Photo is deceiving 
Okay 
Lovely color n material 
Does the job 
so-so 
made of thin plywood 
Good product 
Functional but missing hardware and horrible smell 
A little small 
Looks good- But STINKS and is HARD to put together 
O.k. As far as wet bags go . . . 
bag ok for only few diapers 
Works but not my favorite. 
Really thin and feels cheap. 
Okay nothing great 
Started off great... 
Good wet bag but sometimes hard to close 
I wouldn't put dirty diapers in this bag 
It works 
ok. 
Cute and ok 
better than most not perfect 
Compartments are good but plastic isnt 
Only for certain type of rearview mirror 
Good size easy to hold but they leak 
Breaks after a while 
Ok if you must have soft top 
These WERE great... 
Hard to thread 
More of a headache than anything else 
Updated Review -Loved Cup Realized Choking Hazard 
A decent sippy cup 
Not spill proof! 
Cute 
soso 
does the job 
Wished it was softer 
Great for baby 
I love this but my son didn't. 
not very well insulated 
Looks better on line 
Stylish but not very insulated 
So so 
A good size but not the best insulation 
Nice sling 
Pretty fabric well made but not for big babies not for big breast woman not for winter 
We Returned It 
Nice concept short battery life 
Good concept product has some pluses and minuses to consider 
I wanted to LOVE These Bibs... 
very cool looks keep moisture away from chest... but not from chin 
Comfy but stinky 
Works but had to modify it 
Excellent except... 
Good for newborn poops does not contain stink for solids poops 
Holds in odors but small 
It's Okay 
So stinky!!! 
It's Not Great But It'll Do 
Works Great for Young Babies 
Easy to use but doesn't keep the stink out 
Not as good as the old Diaper Champ 
Doesn't do what it's supposed to 
like this toy but music needs an off switch 
Our son loves it but HELLO needs an on off switch. 
Found a way to turn off the music (thank God!) 
Baby likes it but it comes off suction 
GREAT idea...one MAJOR flaw 
Nice toy but one drawback 
Creepy noises 
It's okay.... 
Enjoyable

Love/Hate Relationship 
Convenient and comfy with my added insert 
short use 
A little peace of mind 
I feel a little ripped off! 
So not worth $32

Good from usage point of view but not in looks. 
Slide around in bra 
A mixed bag

They work but

It's just Okay... 
I liked the older design more 
Works well but is SO HOT!

Daughter loves it! 
It's ok... but I wish I had bought another one...

Stuck between 3 and 4 stars 
Genius product but not long lasting. 
Prefer the Simple Wishes bra 
Great if you have time to set up properly 
Good but... 
Not my favorite but gets the job done 
Works well but expensive 
Too expensive 
Easy on 
hard to get on but once on is good 
Runs small 
Buy a size larger than fits you before baby comes! 
Go up a size from the chart 
not a lot of support 
Order larger than you expect 
Good but not great 
works great - wish it had removable straps 
Does the job but not the most comfortable thing to put on. 
Runs small 
Nice product but it badly needs a hook at the ... 
Small and Awkward 
Great for hands free zipper is weak 
Up to 100 lbs? No Way!  Far Too Narrow in Torso 
She loves tags just not this Taggie 
Works as it should but breaks down quickly in hot humid climates 
Warms slightly 
It's OK... 
very good diaper but size up your child's clothes! 
Not bad 
Great Diapers! 
Love it in theory Hate it in practice 
Nothing special 
too baggy 
Ok better ones out there....

Nice and soft but smaller than I thought it would be. 
Runs small snaps inferior to other pocket diapers 
Very difficult to adjust. 
Not terribly impressed! 
Still on the fence about this one. 
FuzziBunz is good but Flip is better 
Smaller than expected 
Just ok I don't understand the hype 
usable but nothing special 
Just didn't fit my baby---LEAKS! 
Good not great 
Leaks periodically 
Soft diaper 
I don't think these were FuzziBunz inserts 
Great idea just not very absorbant. 
Not terrible but not awesome 
Just OK 
Too big for compact spaces 
My baby loves it I don't like that she can get the sun battery pack out 
Solid play mat 
Wanted to like it more. 
Okay but not thrilling... 
OK but will never survive to toddlerhood 
Does not rock well 
Good choice 
ok 
Not what I expected. 
it is just ok 
Mine is not defective but my opinion? Eh; it's mediocre. 
Rock the Cradle 
Good for smaller babies 
Not impressed 
Will be useful when my baby is bigger but too tall fir him now. 
eh for my son... 
Good product...too bad my baby is still fussy. 
Just OK 
Perfect for the money but easy to trip 
Does the Job 
Nice chair but some issues 
Not a huge fan. 
For the price I expected a little nicer quality 
Agree not so much space saving here 
It's OK. 
Rolling high chair is still the best 
great for smaller infants/toddlers 
I like it but I don't love it. 
Not for fat babies 
This is cute but has some design flaws 
I prefer a cheaper version 
Earlier version is better 
Lost that loving feeling... 
Not as good as the older style 
It's ok 
Just OK 
It's Ok... 
Gets the job done 
This cover is okay but.... 
Elastis isn't forever 
returned. 
the tip part of this paci is really big 
wish it wasn't so hard to roll out the clay 
Was somewhat disappointed 
Push Hard To Get Good Print 
Hard to make it flat 
Not really a rattle 
Mehhhhh... 
Just ok 
Ok for a starting potty 
Wish this was taller 
Good basic potty 
Small and awkward seating 
It's cute but I wouldn't buy it again 
We like it but... 
Baby likes it but it could be better 
So So Rattle 
perfect for 4m-9m 
okay but overhyped 
For older infants. 
not the best quality 
Cute but not necessary 
Doesn't fit City Select nor City Mini double 
More pain than pleasure from this lock! 
its okay 
Good for Travel but not for Daily Use 
Good idea but not executed very well - still it has its uses 
Not perfect but not bad either. 
Great idea but not great in practice. 
Try before you travel - not for younger infants 
Definitely useful in a pinch 
Good choice for an emergency kit or your car not much else 
a good idea could be better 
Good for on the go. 
With some improvements could become a 5 star product 
Concept silly & wasteful in my opinion...but product title is fitting 
Convenient? Definitely. Recyclable? Only technically. 
Just OK - I prefer others 
Super cute...a tad too small 
Not soft enough for newborns 
Nice but not exactly what I thought it would be 
Just ok. 
Decent Burp Cloths 
Good but not great 
not as big as expected but nice material 
Dr Seuss on the Loose! 
Could be cheaper 
not for my daughter but appealing 
It's OK 
neat design makes it less valuable as toothbrushing training 
It's ok. 
Not bad start for teething remedy 
Okay but a magnet for dirt 
Baby loves it but not for young babies 
My son loves this! 
Good for early teething phase 
Daughter loves it but pricey 
Collects lint very easily 
Toddler version is better 
Keeps baby dry...but could make yourself 
you can just cut up some fleece yourself 
I'll make my own in the future 
OK product horribly overpriced 
Great idea but better to 'make' your own 
They work but they're thin. Not my favorite cloth diapering item. 
Helps with irritation 
Make your own & save money 
My baby didn't like it 
Not what I expected 
It's great only if your baby likes it 
Not for bigger babies 
Better for front carry than back carry 
Really wanted to like it but... 
Better than tape but not perfect 
Good if you don't want to \erase\ 
Can't erase the pink one - WTF? 
Not really one-size-fits all 
Too big. 
The bands are cute but the writing washes off FAST 
Good stroller. 
*UPDATE*~*~*~PROS & CONS~I LOVE IT BUT ITS MISSING SOME MAJOR CONVENIENCES~*~*~ 
Expensive and requires you to order more hardware to adapt it to most households.

Just okay 
Best we could find but still just ok.

Not as useful as I'd thought it would be buy a Fisher Price booster instead 
just ok... 
nice but they stain 
Not really a first spoon 
soft and rather good sized 
Not very fitted 
Not very fitted 
Not actually necessary for the Pack and Play 
kind of pointless 
Stains right away 
Froggy Burpy Bib has shrunk 
Stains 
The quality of these bibs are excellent no doubt 
Not worth the money 
My third choice of towels. It's ok not the best though 
I'm disappointed in Aden + Anais 
it's okay 
Not sure why this brand is such a hit. 
great washcloth/so-so towel 
LOVE the fabric but what's with the tags? 
The wash cloths are super soft...the towel not so much

Not bad not great 
Heavy but sturdy and safe 
It Works 
Not as good as Nosefrida

Works but... 
Tissue feature is awesome but... 
Better than a bulb syringe 
Can't complain at this price but has it's issues 
Fell out of love after a year 
Wish the included screws fit the TV 
NOT TRULY A 3-in-1 CRIB:  BUYER BEWARE! 
It's OK... 
Works great 
Did not work so well for me. 
bottom corners at center line are firm enough to scratch 
Flimsy but cute 
They are great in that they do allow you more hands free ...

Meh... 
Cute but runs big 
Buy one size less than you think you need

Very thin liners 
Good at what they do 
these are flimsy 
I like the concept but I can do without these

Soft but Imse Vimse works better 
Does the job but falls apart/shifts around a lot. 
Not really flushable 
Not what I was looking for

Short 
Sits too low 
Lovely non-scratching design doesn't hold much. 
Great but very small 
Cool concept but too short 
Like other people say 
Sturdy but Not Tall Enough 
Not for rounded crib surfaces 
Serves its purpose once you get past the smell 
Great tub - did not last as long as I would hope. 
Ok

OK bath toy 
Cute 
Just okay 
Squirters 
Does what it's supposed to do 
Doesn't keep water out of eyes. 
Works somewhat

The average water squirter 
Squirt? 
These were just mediocre...

Great bowl but awful lid 
they're okay 
Awkard for left handers

Returning It 
Pluses and minuses

Do not purchase if you intend to use in a pack in play over a thicker mattress topper 
So soft got very misshapen after first wash 
Snug 
Small 
Soft and plush 
Nice quality but a little small 
Does not fit the Dream on me 3\ mattress 
Makes my mattress fold up 
Too short 
Three Stars 
Picture a little misleading

Good for crib on the small side for a twin 
could be bigger 
Good quality 
I should have looked at the dimensions more carefully. 
Gets thinner and not absorbent after a while 
Ok- not that great value 
Great for short period of time 
not what I thought it was 
Wasn't as nice as I expected 
It works but pricey 
Just get the bassinet-sized pads 
Too small to actually do much 
Cute and handy! 
a bit small for diapering 
Small pads 
Should have paid more attention to the size 
These lap pads are small 
not waterproof?! 
Handy but very small 
Prefer the bigger bassinet pads but wonderful product 
Small and stiff 
Gets crushed easily 
Does the job 
Works Great but looks horrible after just 1 wash 
Too small for the bassinet cushion 
It would probably work for a bassinet 
Shrunk in the dryer 
Not thick enough! 
Just too big 
good but not my go-to 
Trial run great idea! Long term not so much. 
Ok--but pricey for how much you get 
Kissaluvs Lotion Potion 
Love the smell 
Works okay but doesn't smell the best. 
Good but a bottle can last you longer if you don't follow the directions! 
Not Sure if It's Helping 
Thick wipes for big messes (but not for delicate parts) 
No velcro closure 
Not my first choice for an overnight fitted 
It Would Be Great Except... 
wet on baby's skin 
Not bad but not great 
I like Countours 
Not the right match for my toddler 
Just ok 
Great Value / Good for light doubler protection 
Okay but I like others better 
Great bag but strap coming loose after only a few uses. 
Way too small! 
Does the job.  But also shrinks fades. 
Peace on Earth bag has no strap 
Great bag but the snap on the handle broke quickly 
The handle fell off but it still works. 
Not &lt;quite> what I wanted 
Hard to tie on and off - but better than not having them at all. 
Not a Two Pack 
small 
Didnt really like this 
Works but has a few problems 
Disappointed 
Straw too short?! 
Okay... 
Not Foolproof for a Toddler 
Not as leak proof as other sippy bottles

easy to use straw but leaks if the cap isn't closed 
Not leak proof 
Three Stars 
It leaks but it's still better than plastic 
dimensions mostly good 
OK pillow 
Not as soft as other package 
Disappointing as a swaddler but cute for other uses 
Soft but time intensive to swaddle 
Fabric doesn't have any give to it 
I like these but they aren't the same... 
nothing special 
In general good but... 
kind of rough but good size and pricing 
Decent but I wasn't aware these were sort of \knock offs\ 
Not all the way spill proof 
liquids don't come out 
Not good not bad 
Nice size weird nipples. 
Looks better in the pictures 
It's OK 
It gets the job done... 
Room For Improvement 
Good but... 
They're ok 
Great product but won't stick to tables 
Maybe for feeding non-messy fingers foods to a younger baby... 
I like it but suction cups don't stick well 
Stains too easily - difficult to clean 
Not what I had hoped for. 
Stains WAY too Easily 
I want to love this 
It's Ok but I am not a fan of the food catcher 
Good but not great 
Rust on clasps 
Worked well for a while but clip loosens with continued use. 
Son prefers these to Avent. 
A good bottle but not the best one for my mildly colicky baby 
Love the idea love the nipple find the bottle annoying 
Daughter Wouldn't Take It 
Not bad not great... 
it is OKAY thats it 
Ok 
a toothbrush 
Good first toothbrush 
son won't use it 
Not the best

OK for price 
It's a alright product! 
OK bags 
Small mouth dependable bag 
Seal is weak 
Strong smell no leaking 
Pros & Cons to these bags

Not for two pacifiers 
way too small 
not practical 
Could be a little easier to use 
Closes not tight enough 
Should come with instructions 
Not so useful 
Hard to clip on 
Didn't fool my breastfed baby 
Just OK 
Hard rubber against sore little gums was not popular 
Dissappointed 
Great cup bad spout 
Good cup design but the spout is terrible 
The cup is good the spout is terrible. 
Cute but hard to suck liquid out 
Nuk latex nipples 
Soft spout but has rubber smell 
love the product hate the color

Doodle bug toy 
Get a jumper instead

Good product 
Cool idea but some downsides 
not very bright loud cheap remote 
Good medium/light-weight stroller not perfect. 
Front wheel gets stuck backward--but Contours sent replacement

Very nice stroller for the price.  UPDATED INFORMATION! 
Bolts popping off! 
Meets your needs for a lightweight stroller but still lacking 
Just ok 
Yes this is a light wt strooler.

check second hand first 
I want to love it but I can't.

Overpriced and not nearly all we were expecting! 
After several weeks I could not recommend. 
leak 
Hard to get the top to close all the way 
These are good but leak easily if not threaded properly - WOW Cups are better 
Straw weight is great but cup leaks 
Helpful for a while but gets moldy in tiny places 
They'd be perfect if they didn't leak. 
Cool concept but they leak 
Best straw cup I have found 
Really wanted to love this. 
It's the only thing our son likes but it causes either leaks or creates such a tight seal that it's hard to sip 
Consumable and disposable; difficult to reuse 
Great cup until it rusted. 
Better than other straw cups but not that great 
it's not bad 
Great design but cheaply made especially the straw. 
okay 
not like the first couple I bought 
Good cup but may not last long 
Great but Not Perfect 
Great cup but the straws don't last 
I love it I hate it

Just okay 
Better in concept than in reality 
Great first cup for 10 month old but it leaks. 
They do leak :-( 
Not a bad product just not for us.

Needs improvement 
It's okay

Just Ok 
Not very soothing 
Ok Bouncer...Needs Some Improvements 
Great for napping 
Cute and usefulbut not the best. 
Depend on the kid 
not for tall babies 
Not sturdy enough for little tinies 
Baby is not sure about it. 
Doesn't stay semi-reclined--falls open! 
Awkward to put baby into swing 
Nice Decoration for Living Room 
Dont skip the infant and won't work rear facing! 
Hard to clean - Headrest pad does not come off 
Pretty but loud 
Not good for large cats but works well for smaller ones... 
Okay but not for really small babies 
Not bad not great. 
Ok for the price... 
Way too reclined 
Nice but not convenient 
Kinda small 
Too small for our needs... 
good not great 
green shade has changed from earlier in the year 
Grass it hard plastic 
Works great and looks great.  But yes too small.  Here's why... 
Great for small spaces and very cute but does not fit much 
Trendy funky look - wish it was more functional 
ok product 
Small puzzle 
It's okay 
NOT a bath toy but an ok temperature tester 
Pretty good 
Meh it's okay. Single purpose use only compared to alternative 
I use this for twins 
At first it was great ... then the love disappeared

Just OK

Warm but hard to secure 
So-so Swing

No variability in swing speed music is off key 
This is such a great Spacesaver!  Good Buy! 
Nice compact swing 
eh just ok 
got our baby sick 
Skip it Get the Woombie 
Okay but Frustrating! 
The type with velcro wings is better! 
Too loose 
Wish I waited 
Newborn size is 5-10lb not 7-12lb 
Not for a newborn over 7LB 
Good sleep sack 
Good but not perfect. 
Wouldn't recommend for a newborn 
Too many strings 
Ok. Not Great 
Mediocre but Sufficient - You get what you pay for 
Ok 
Broke! 
Keep slipping off 
It's an okay product 
Good pacifier...unhappy with color choice 
Get the Medela Brand 
What is with the tops? 
It is what it says 
Very very soft--not at all firm 
My boy got scared of it 
Potential but didn't work great 
Okay Faucet Cover 
cute for the money 
keeps drawers closed removes finish 
Good basic book

Good product but doesn't always work 
useless for my baby but nice product 
good idea but doesn't work that well 
Bulky but works 
Nice product but the width for the spoon and fork not practical for babies learning to feed themselves 
Yes it shrinks. 
Good cover terrible washing instructions 
Shrinks and twists with washing but usable 
A lot smaller than I thought

Teeny tiny! 
TEENY TINY BAG 
Great design annoying to wash 
No hanging hook 
Fits a few diapers 
Only used occasionally 
Holds in wetness NOT stink!! 
Small? 
Item not as shown in photo 
The small is REALLY small. 
Leak Proof but not Stink Proof 
Will try another brand next time 
Needs a Loop 
Works great but a pain to wash/dry 
received different item than what's shown 
Small 
Great bag - small is SMALL though 
Very Small 
Underwhelmed 
Small for 1 cloth diaper 
Handle is already tearing off 
Smaller than given measurements 
Go with the medium 
Not as high of quality as the bag that I purchased before 
Snap on handle lost it's 'snap' 
Cute hold a lot but leak. 
yeah small.... 
Used for 8 months and leaks 
Just \OK\ 
You Get What You Pay For: Fell Apart While On Run 
Front wheel

Nice concept but ... 
Doesn't fit the Graco snug ride car seat 
Comfy nice material 
Expensive but nice. 
Not sure if I think this is necessary~ 
holds straws in place 
Like the clip. Ridiculous it can't be ordered by color! 
Too wide 
Munchkin cups - edge is a little sharp! 
Very lightweight 
Just cups 
Too large for little hands to hold onto securely 
Ikea cups are better and cheaper. (These Munchkins are just OK.) 
Get the Nuby set instead 
Good for Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail 
Work Okay 
Not sure these do too much 
Love The Smell - Doesn't Do Job Though

could be better 
Expected more from Arm & Hammer 
Decent quality 
Not bad not great.. 
Nice product but needs improvement 
neh...

Not great 
Decent Product 
Great concept; not as odor neutralizing 
UMMMM?? 
Not as handy as expected 
It's OK 
My son didn't love this book like I thought he would... 
Eh... 
Our son could take it or leave it. 
Just okay 
Serves its Purpose But you Need a Breathable Bumper 
Good size and quality but too big for trunk 
imperfections noted on the wood 
Waterballon 
Serves the purpose 
Works as expected 
Better than Gerber but not much 
Okay product 
Adequate Waterproof Pants 
Warning: Do not put in dryer 
Too big 
Great idea... 
Didn't stop the leaking 
Good 
Run huge 
Too big for tall and lean kids 
Better than in retail store. 
can't complain 
Good for price 
I wouldn't recommend this product 
it works but a measuring cup is better 
Eh... just OK. 
Works leaks a bit gets really hot not all bottles fit. 
Works But Is Difficult To Mantain. 
Good - not perfect 
Good but could be better. 
good heater but nothing special...do i need it? probably not. 
Can't clean...mold buildup/health hazard 
It's ok 
Expected a lot better quality for Dr Browns! 
Good warmer leaky 
Wish it was wider in width 
It's a bottle warmer.  Yeah. 
Works well 
Not really impressed 
Fine but unnecessary 
Very hard to get closed 
Disappointed 
Need the ability to choose color and re-order lids! 
Didn't fit a single door in our house... 
Did not work on any of 5 doors 
Didn't fit 
Doesn't Fit My Doors 
It worked great for me until my son turned 3 
Works but too expensive 
Affordable but don't rely solely on them for containment of children. 
Changing table is useless 
OK buy! Good stroller 
Short short short 
Cute but not the best 
Time lifesaver! 
works but... 
My baby loves it but.. 
Looks great but not functional (or safe) for infants 
Oddly designed and just doesn't beat my JJ Cole blanket 
Falls apart 
Burns not sure I like it 
I Loved It...but then it leaked 
Just OK 
Not our favorite sippy 
my kid never liked this cup and never would take a sip out of it 
It's the only sippy cup my daughter will use too! 
good product 
Handle Isn't Fixed in Place 
Great concept - wish it was dishwasher safe 
Nice...not perfect. 
Best caddy around but needs improvement 
Basically useless to us 
Bought it but didnt need it for car seat - great for Fisher Price Rock & Play Sleeper 
Seems to be sufficient 
It protects. 
glad i bought but 
Wish it was longer 
Cute but not quite as functional as I had hoped 
stylish large bag that doesn't look like a diaper bag 
The best but falling apart after 3 months! 
It does the job 
LOVE(D) THIS BAG! - Past tense 
It's not roomy enough.  Need More Space! 
Nice purse...less nice diaper bag. 
hot and cold 
Great idea but in theory. 
Good spoons but a little short 
Shallow bowl 
Better for play kitchen 
ok but not my favorite mei tai 
So far I'm not complaining 
Short-lived. Not good value for money 
Ok but flawed 
Ok organizer 
Cute design just not functional for us 
Nice night light but some design flaws... 
night light 
meh.. 
A bit too bright. Only red green blue for all night light. 
I like it but there are issues 
doesn't fit all tubs 
Works As Advertised But For How Long? 
This is actually the Carters Tree Tops sheet not Forest Friends 
Good but could be more robust 
Too soft. 
Stopped vibrating after 3 weeks 
It has suction cups (groan) 
As good as it gets I guess 
Suction cup does not stick 
too small 
Too deep! 
These are alright spoons 
ok i prefer softer spoons for really young feeders 
Ridiculously Long! 
Fine. 
Cute spoons but the spoon portion is too deep for 7 month old 
Spout needs to be replaced FREQUENTLY 
Not bad but not great 
No go for my almost 8 month old 
soft & easy to use 
Not great for us 
Get the job done 
Good daughter wasn't a fan 
There are pros and cons to this cup 
nice construction but doesnt fit well. 
cute but not what i was looking for 
I like other covers better 
Love them but too big for our 8lb new born. 
Not as big as I expected laminate is acquiring a weird texture - delaminating?? 
Okay liner 
Not as good as the Planet Wise 
Already had a hole 
Serviceable 
Daughter won't take them 
Love the Paci - hate the colors 
Nice drool control bib 
Scratchy material too big for a newborn. 
NOT unscented 
Prefer the newer version 
OK but a little dry 
Work well but they do smell 
So many better wipes out there 
Used to be good 
These are all right. 
Ok but wish they were wetter. 
Going with the thicker version next 
Wanted to love these but... 
wipes ok packaging not so much 
Very bad changes to these wipes! 
eh! 
not best seventh gen. product 
Mediocre wipes... 
Small dry and just not that soft... 
do not like their smell 
Decent 
wipes 
nice wipes a bit pricey 
Just OK 
EHHH 
A good unscented wipe 
Not so soft and gentle 
Could have been better 
A little flimsy 
So if these are \free & clear\ what does the scented smell like? 
couldnt use with a fussy baby 
Don't rush in 
Still prefer the traditional bulb 
Far too expensive for a marginally better product 
Works way better than bulb but.... 
Needs ventilation holes 
While it is a good idea and important for very young babies 
Only good for tiny infants 
Serves its purpose. 
Great patter Huge bag holds onto stink. 
Appearances can be deceiving 
My only complaint is how you have to wash it 
DId not hold up 
Sturdy bag 
Color Fades - Be careful how you launder it 
Great Idea

they work ok - the diaper dekor itself isn't great for capturing smells 
We loved this until my son started eating solids 
work but pricey 
doesn't hold as many diapers as it claims 
Expensive!

It's just ok and the kid hasn't really taken to it much

Why do they make this without a good seal?  Spills breast milk very easily! 
Don't like the lid 
Three Stars 
Maybe I should have just gotten an Ice cube tray 
Doesn't seal tightly just get regular trays 
Wish the lid was air tight
