The Book Was Better

FOR CHRISTIANS ONLY 
Most Unrealistic Version of Jesus' Life I've Ever Seen

Waiting for a director 
Bad geography 
Historical Hammer Hilarity or something to that effect!

Great gore effects but otherwise unremarkable zombie fare 
Awesomely gruesome but trashy.

You can't go home to Eaton Place again! 
A Lot of Drama 
Sub Par 
too old for me 
Upstairs Downstairs should be dropped to the dungeon 
Not what I expected 
No captions on Upstairs Downstairs prime 
a bit cheesy 
It's Okay If You Don't Love the Book 
The book's Jane Eyre - Not so much 
I just can't like this version. 
Ridiculous Rochester 
Fierce Creature 
Disappointing Version Of A Classic Love Story/Suspense Thriller. Grossly Overacted By Ciaran Hinds. 
How could any Jane Eyre fan love this movie??!! 
Definitely the Worst of the TV/Movie Adaptions 
Nice acting but why didn't they use the book? 
Not the Jane Eyre Movie I was looking for 
Good  - but shop around 
Not bad for a movie but try one of the mini-series 
A huge disappointment 
A truncated cheap Jane Eyre 
Mr. Rochester AKA Austin Powers.................. 
Sad 
DISAPPOINTING

Great intentions... poor execution

The Future Looks Disappointing... 
Has Its Moments but Mostly a Mess of Bad Directorial or Perhaps Bad Editing Decisions. 
Countermeasures 
Keanu Reeves is likable almost always but this isn't even as good as 'Plughead Rewired: Circuitry Man II' 
I know it's fiction but the plot connections still need to be logical! 
I Think My Hard Drive Was Too Big To Take This Movie Seriously 
ALMOST AS BAD AS &quot;EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES!&quot; 
Give it the Boot - See the original not the derivative version 
Director's Cut -- just doesn't cut it

\OK' film but it could have been a lot better- REALLY!!!! 
In All Honesty!!!!!! 
Bad adaptation 
I paid an outrageous $46 for this Blu-Ray. I feel so ashamed of myself for getting so caught up in the Ebay bidding frenzy 
Here in my car I feel safest of all

Turgid Historical Tableux

The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078 
This movie will break more than just your jaw... 
WOW 
A Watered Down &quot;Heathers&quot; for the 90's. 
morbid 
Lame High School Dark Comedy 
Jawbreaker somebody say something funny 
Heathers this ain't 
Teen movie tries hard but doens't succeed 
Boring romance with a twist ending. 
A Glacial look at English Blitz love 
Its lack of emotional depth left me longing for the end of the movie... 
It's No &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; 
The End of the Soundtrack 
Buck Naked Brits! 
There's something is extremely awful here 
So syrupy sweet I almost got a toothache 
Great direction but the story drags 
A terrible adaptation and performance 
A slow romance to nowhere 
Stock characters stock plot not much Emma T 
Better the 2nd time around with judicious use of the FF 
Great concept horrible execution 
Boring and well inertly comic 
Another misfire from Boorman 
A Horror Of A Horror Movie. 
ILHM Reviews: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation 
it WAS!!!going very good!!!! AND THEN!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! 
\Welcome... to myyyyy world!\ 
The Adventures of Leatherface Queen of the Rural 
The performances by Renee and Matthew were only good things 
Disgrace to Leatherface Fans!!!!!!!! 
I'm sorry but huh? 
Bad but still worth watching 
Not nearly as bad as I was led to believe. 
At least it has a sense of humor 
A Decent Plot but a Bad Movie 
the Texas chainsaw massacre part 4 should be taken of the store shelfs and recalled 
Awful film barely saved by a couple of decent acting performances 
The Worst of all Massacres! 
The infection is spreading faster ... 
bad for two reasons 
Stick with the first movie 
Lame movie topped off with a bad dvd transfer 
A poor excuse for violence. 
Unforgivable ending 
I've written a song about this movie... 
A carbon-copy of the first movie...what's the point? 
BLARG! oh sorry... 
Don't waste your time 
Alice must fight the Nemesis. 
Better then the first...but that's not saying much. 
Not Even Near the Heights of the Video Game... 
Good action but they tried to do too much 
Alice! Who the (----) is Alice!? 
What??? 
Mind blowing 
First sign of the apocalypse 
Like 1st like 2nd - simple 
No atmosphere! 
Worse than the first one... 
Wretched Excess Piled on Top of Wretched Excess 
closer to 3 stars 
Dissapointed down right pissed off a times 
Wasted opportunity 
Mindless fun but where's the fun? 
As Cool as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! 
More Actions But Mostly Uninspired and Repetitive 
A 12 year-old with a $50 camcorder could do better 
Mixed feelings 
OK 
cute movie but fricken sad 
A movie from my childhood 
It's all about presentation and this film is presented in the worst possible way... 
HEART BREAKING STORY AND TRANSFER 
Entertaining flash'n'trash 
Swingers 
A few good scenes in an otherwise stupid movie 
Yet another weak &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; rip-off. 
Not that good. 
Unless you really really really like the tango avoid 'Tango' 
Great for tango fanatics but maybe not for others 
poor 
Unrealized potential 
Make up your own ending 
pure trash 
Save your money and buy a Greg Araki film 
It started out pretty good. 
Get off the road; immediately... 
Wasted Cast 
Uneven Sometimes Laughable Thriller 
Good Premise Undermined by Improbable Conclusion 
Immediately forgettable 
Not for me 
Good acting direction script... and yet incredibly annoying... 
Makes too many assumptions. 
We're all screwed? 
Mr. Bridges - what were you thinking? 
Arlington Road should have done a lot better than this 
Weak story poorly executed 
Good DVD -- lousy movie. 
Wasn't as good as I thought I remembered 
A classic of stunning ineptitude. 
LITE METAL 
Must have been out of my mind 
Heavily muddled... 
Heavily Disapointed 
I hate my eyes... 
Hideously over-produced loud garish spectacle 
Steven Spielberg is one of my all-time favorite directors BUT... 
A Spielberg Film That Just Sits There--It's Inert 
To little here for the kids. 
Even The Greatest  Can Get It All Wrong 
lacks magic 
This Peter doesn't soar 
MAGGIE SMITH MAGGIE SMITH MAGGIE SMITH 
Only the bedroom scenes were interesting and like the original 
Great Movie crappy delivery 
Too slow too poorly directed. 
Beatifully Boring 
Omg

You are all going to hate me...but...BORING 
great actors zero plot/story 
Write that in your diary Isa! 
Not what I 
I'm sorry I saw this 
Shaky at Best 
Bobcat is Better as a Standup Comic 
Not what I expected 
Backfired in our case 
Too slow for us. 
Would have expected better... 
A Conflagration 
INCREDIBLE BUT TRUE ! THIS MOVIE IS ALMOST FRENCH ! 
Dissapointing Version of the Joan Of Arc Story! 
Is Jeanne a Heroine or Not? 
Burn this film at the stake! 
INVESTS EVERYTHING BUT STILL COMES UP SHORT 
My opinion...don't bother.... 
An Uninspired Epic... 
Yawwnnnnnnnnnn 
Fatally flawed - Leeloo meets Joan 
Burn the witch 
A VISUALLY ARRESTING TRAVESTY 
Braveheart with breasts 
A Novel Attempt Ruined by A Poor Screenplay and Bad Acting 
Several great bowl-cuts but a stinker of a film. 
Overlong overdone over the top~~ 
Quantitative Evaluation 
well.....it was okay 
\Whatever!\ 
Jojovich stands out in this seen-it-all-before movie. 
Get Duguay's epic instead. 
Can't compare with the silent film 
This movie should have been so much more 
Still Looking for the Genuine Joan but entertaining nevertheless 
Who Was More Schizo:  the Protagonist or the Screenwriter 
Drives one to read 
No luck for Luc 
Turned it off after 20 minutes 
One joke movie 
Uh... 
all about chauvinism 
Typical Almod&oacute;var film. 
Lost 
Kinda Korny 
Watchable to say the least 
Plays best as a parody 
letdown 
Overt Child Exploitation That Never Redeems Itself Satisfyingly 
Memorable only for its novelty 
when your family may not survive you must still go to school 
Listless Fantasy Has Few Memorable Scenes. 
Don't Be Fooled This Movie Is Boring 
Stay away from this film. 
Oh if it was only a Phone call...... 
not very good 
JUST HANG UP; THIS MOVIE IS A &quot;WRONG NUMBER&quot;!

BORNING 
A student film run amuck 
Great Plot-Dirty Talk 
Banal 
Make a good Confession 
BOLDLY CYNICAL (AND OCCASIONALLY FUNNY) LOCKER-ROOM PRATTLE 
Definitely not a great film but mildly entertaining 
Blu Ray 
immature take on Christianity 
Gory satire 
The downward spiral that is Kevin Smith 
This 2000 Edited Reprint lacks original hillarious material. 
A waste. 
An Interstellar Comedy 
Featherweight comedy is disappointing from Shandling 
miserable waste of wonderful talents 
Disappointing And Without Consistence 
I think Jills just ripped me off! 
LAME LUNDGREN 
Awful: cheap and cheesy. 
two for the scenery  photography and stereo sound 
Not As Good As The Book by Alcott 
\Go and embrace your liberties!\ 
I'll admit the photography was lovely... 
Bad interpretation of the classic book 
Gillian Armstrong's Career Tarnishes 
Drown this One Please 
A Misguided Mess 
No doubt about it... this movie is awful. 
Mildly Amusing...at best. 
The tone didn't hit the right key. 
What happened? 
ALL THAT STAR POWER COMES TO THIS...WHAT A SHAME 
Unattractive characters inspire only rare chuckles 
Not bad

Disappointing 
A Soap-opera which leaves you empty in the end. 
strange story 
the weakest Morse of all....where Lewis? 
Cute movie bad quality 
This was not the good movie I thought it was 
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER 
Wasn't What I Expected 
\Metropolis\ was Lang's masterpiece not \M\. 
Primitive Even By Past Contemporary Standards. However ... 
ALLOW ME TO BE FRANK...BUY MoC INSTEAD OF CRITERION. 
vacuous adoration -- the death trap of a bad movie 
Don't say I didn't warn you 
Misguided to say the least 
Disgusting Disturbing UNNECESSARY 
Night accompanying a LOT of fog is more like 
Misguiding Title 
slow and somewhat superficial good cinematography 
The worst side of the &quot;art film&quot; 
needs restoration 
First pairing of Olivier and Leigh
