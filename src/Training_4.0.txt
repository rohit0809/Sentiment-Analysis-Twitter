Test For Echo Takes The Heaviness A Step Further 
Rush Still Stumbling Through the 90's 
A Keeper 
Would be a classic for most mortal bands 
Very close to perfect.

Masterpiece 
Landmark album... 
A trip 
The rock opera of Pink aka a mutation of Syd and Roger 
Great Concept Album One of the Best of All Time But So-so Sound Quality!

Not Floyd's best but still great. 
Well cemented bricks 
Any band but Pink Floyd would get 5 stars! 
Roger Water's Wall 
Sounds like a remake of.... 
Good album but not Pink Floyd at their best 
pink floyd with roger waters time ten 
This Wall is not gonna be fall! 
Get the live version (Is There Anybody Out There) instead. 
Great but The Final Cut and Dark Side are better 
Wonderful pressing 
A long narritive set to rock; not entirely successful. 
Brilliant but hard to get through in one setting 
The Wall CD 
A Classic.....But NOT The Greatest. 
PINK FLOYD'S WALLS &amp; BRIDGES 
Great songs but.... 
Almost Masterpiece

Very good not the best in my mind. 
Great Album - Not great re-release 
A hard rocking album with some acoustic pieces 
less one star for slightly dull \re-issue\ sound but 5 stars for music 
A definite classic but it's still not quite the best Tull cd (upgraded from 3 to 4 stars) 
Heavy Tull!

Batteries run out awfully quick 
THIS IS GREAT! 
Good but not that great 
You're an idiot if you haven't bought this 
game of its own catagory!! 
Playstation + Fighting = Tekken 3

Lacks the polish of Soul Calibur but by FAR more rewarding 
What can I say? 
The plot's the best part

Stunning... simply stunning. 
the under-appreciated VIII 
an afterthought 
Pretty good 
Final Fantasy: The Standard of RPG's 
Great graphics but too much teen angst. 
Unwarranted Affection 
Dont believe the bad reviews it's actually pretty good. 
Beautiful Graphics Repetitive Battles 
A good play. 
Worth a play through if you've got a lot of free time 
Good game but it can get a bit tedious.

Decent for the most part 
From the most overrated FF (VII) to the most underated(VIII) 
The Best Mechwarrior Game ever! 
Great game - but download the patch 
Fun and intense worth your money but.... 
If Postal was an FPS 
Great 3D Graphics BUT... 
Awsome!

Feels more like a spinoff of Quake 2 than a true sequel 
Q3A 
I can't get this game to run properly anymore but it was awesome while it lasted. 
Heavy in story telling element a graphic adventure with a bit of action for kicks. 
They Shoot Romulans Don't They? 
A classic platformer 
Everybody loves Rayman 
A Trip Down Memory Lane 
Awesome sequel (4.5 stars) 
How do you explain this game? 
An engaging adventure 
Such a great game... If only it had stayed perfect... 
Definitely a good buy 
Much Better then the PlayStation version (except...) 
A pleasing expansion for a great game 
Great as a game not as an expansion pack 
Roller Coaster Tycoon Expansion Pack: Corkscrew Follies 
High Quality Low Quantity. 
I'd Give it 4 and a 1/2 if I could 
Shame they don't make them like this anymore 
Looks like the real thing... and I know about it! 
Extremely demanding sim - needs training module!! 
Solid. 
Why haven't they made Age of Wonders III???

What the Original Should Have Been

Great city-building game similar to Caesar 3 
Best of the Sierra CITY GAMES to date for me 
Excellent / Addictive
