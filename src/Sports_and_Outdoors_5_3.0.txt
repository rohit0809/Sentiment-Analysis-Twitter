Good product 
Not bad but shop around 
Poor uniformity

AMAZING but true 
Clips

Very functional 
Basket itself is ok

Good but can be intensive 
Tight fit 
good value for what I want it to do

Size & weight vs. function 
Ok 
This pumps works fine. It comes with a clip that is easily ... 
I have to be a little critical here ... 
decent pump and it works but it's not the easiest to use 
Weak to reach 60 PSI. 
REALLY Good for a small portable pump

TOPEAK BAR EXTENDER 
It pumps 
It's a good little pump but it won't last long. 
Not as small as you think 
An old design that works except for the gauge which failed on the two that I've owned.  Switching valve types isn't good either. 
It pumps... 
eh... 
my arms hurt 
High quality but relatively small. 
Falls off 
Small light but of questionable quality. 
Pumping to 160 PSI? Forget it

Big and Clumbsy 
Handy tool but.. 
Everything you need but too clunky to use it all 
not a bad tool kit. 
Too Big and Too Bulky to keep in a Pack 
just a tad too big 
looks great but does not work that well 
I thought these used to be metal? 
Good Item 
Well-made but where's the 5/8\ adjustment?! 
Reasonable multi-function tool 
Useful but overpriced compared to similar tools 
Hate the new case 
It's useful for when you need it but could have been made better 
handy 
Too far.

You get what you pay for 
Heavy duty - and I mean \heavy\ 
A 'don't mess with me' lock with a few drawbacks 
It is strange bag 
Boy it's high off the ground 
Really a 3.5.... read why!

M-16 Tactical Bayonet Knife 
Try out a big cruiser seat at store before you buy 
not as soft as they described

ants walk right by it or eat it for days and don't seem to die. 
Works as advertised!  I have stock up for next ant season! 
Didn't work crazy well 
Not the same Terro of 30 years ago 
So So 
Hard to say... 
Kills ants by drowning them instead of poisoning them
