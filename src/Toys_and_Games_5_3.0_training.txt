Almost good 
great for motor skills 
Just Didn't Hold Up At All 
Smaller than I envisioned 
Not what I remember... 
Breaks too easily 
JUNK but.....

Bored with Hisss 
Boring and repetitive 
maybe not that exciting 
It's okay... 
Cute but needs more pieces. 
We only played with this a couple of times.

Not used like traditional pattern blocks 
My son lost interest pretty quickly..

Worried about the safety of the monkey 
Too expensive for little thrills 
Above-average playset lacks an \off button\ 
A fun addition to the LP collection 
Okay 
10 minutes of noise in a box 
Okay set if your children are gentle it may last 
Not as loud as I thought! 
Could be louder (did I really just type that?) 
So-so; some items are fine others are poor quality 
This is a Band in a Box SPECIFICALLY if you dont want the band to be loud 
Great instruments 
Good for noise - just don't expect any musical instruments. 
Kind of difficult to use 
Nice but a bit too simple 
Good but boring 
Thought that it would be easier to use.

Snap Circuits 
GREAT FUN 
size...size.... 
Pieces a lot smaller than they appear 
nice to build 
Paint comes off....is it lead?

I started with these for my twins... 
Not so MAGICAL! 
Didn't work for us 
Take it or leave it...
