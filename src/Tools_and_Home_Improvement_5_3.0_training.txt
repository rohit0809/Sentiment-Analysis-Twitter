Needs some design work 
No need to buy this saw

Good ladder but relatively cheap finger pinching hinges 
It does everything it says - with a little effort 
You don't have to be a child of the 60s to say \It's heavy\

Use a ladder stand-off (bull horn)

It Does What I Want 
Second time's the charm 
Great hose but coils up a bit too easily for my preference. 
Coiling!?! 
TOUGH HOSE 
Pretty good hose 
Should have bought something else. 
Use what I can ??

Lasted 5 years sort of.... 
Kinda hard to rate this product 
Get's the job done 
Shop Vac filter 
Looks like it might have worked 
Would not fit my 20 year old shop vac 
Get the HEPA filter instead
