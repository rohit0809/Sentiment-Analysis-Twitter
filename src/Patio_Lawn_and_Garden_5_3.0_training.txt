Fun and functional but a lot of work 
Close but no Cigar 
hmmm not the best hose in the world 
Not as happy as I thought I was going to be. 
It does what it was intended to do.... 
LIGHT IN UNIT WAS FAULTY......AND MORE DISAPPOINTMENTS! 
Not useful for mosquito control 
It's a great moth killer but... 
A good bug zapper but attracted a lot of moths 
Kills everything not sure if it reduces mosquitoes 
Effective but not completely; and it DOES CLOG (at first!) 
First bug zapper = DOA second one is bent but works 
EXPENSIVE AUDIO SATISFACTION OF MOSQUITO DEATH 
my own experience with this tool 
Corona Corona From Across the Sea 
It's a bit flimsy but gets the job done if you're careful 
Works but I will never use it again 
Not for people with 5 thumbs. 
Nothing To Brag About 
Good reel mower 
Flimsy 
It does the job but I might try something else next time. 
fair but not great 
Not sure 
Mice trip Kness Tip-Trap by walking ON it... flawed by design 
This is why the reviews aren't great 
A tiny gripe - why change what was working? 
Well made but very hard to clean 
I like this product 
Too big bulky and heavy for the hanging cord 
WORKS INEXPENSIVE NEEDS A HOOK ADDED TO HANG 
Expensive 
A Little work involved 
OK for what it is 
\one touch clean up\ - not quite 
REVERT BACK TO THE OLD WOOD HANDLES 
An honest review (UPDATE) 
Catches only the smallest rodents. 
Worked At First But Then Failed - a review of the \Tin Cat\ 
it's ok 
Better have some muscle.. 
The product works well enough but I saw it cheaper at a local store 
Nice for awhile 
There ok for small cuts 
you CAN get replacement blades; you'll need it 
it looks good though

Good But Needs Improvement 
Sturdy but could have more handy features 
Deters squirrels but has issues 
Perky Pet Squirrel be gone bird feeder 
Cost VS Practicality 
Better options exist but holds a lot of seed 
Yes It IS Squirrel Proof BUT... 
NO squirrel damage...but...NO BIRDS either 
Nice Feeder but Ridiculously Expensive 
Perch legs are too short 
Much bigger than I expected worried about how long it will last 
Attractive functional feeder - little birds love it 
Perky-Pet Squirrel be gone not really 
The Good and The Not So Good 
Good product but I can't justify the price 
large but seems a little flimsy 
Best for small seed not whole sunflower seeds 
Squirrel proof but birds don't seem to like it either! 
Looks good but not completely effective 
Made well but needs a 2.0 version 
Nuts to you!! 
Nice but the birds don't seem to like it! 
There's something about the design that birds don't like 
ok 
not for uneven yards or yards with rocks/roots - blade will get bent 
Got what i paid for. 
not useful 
Not sure if they work. 
Not particularly scary 
It works......... 
Works well but..... 
Not for short critters 
didn't  last 
Zapper screen is small in comparison to others on market

Not for the impatient multi-tasker. 
not large enough for my generator 
Flimsy but works.. 
So-so 
Okay For What It Is... 
Good for light duty task. 
Not for fall cleanup.... 
For blowing out garage and walkways 
Should have gotten a longer trimmer 
So hot! 
not professional quality 
Serves its purpose. 
Classic but not for me. 
So Far No Noticeable Positive Effects When Taken Internally

Mixed Results 
Worked for some animals but not for others. 
Somewhat effective

I thought it might work but didn't do much. 
Seems to work on rabbits but not on squirrels 
Not particularly effective 
Seems to be helping

Havahart battery powered repellent 
Maybe Another Season of Use Will Determine Effectiveness 
OK so far 
Somewhat works! 
It worked but not consistently 
Red squirrels didn't seem impressed.... 
Arrived damaged. Really damaged. 
Difficult delivery system 
Limited success with repellent (but nice sprayer) 
Sprayer didn't work 
Works well until it rains or you water the plants.  So you have to reapply often. 
OK

I don't know if it is good

Mixed Results. 
Perhaps not the most effective for larger acreage. 
I am so torn about this product after two months of use 
Works But Only for a Small Area 
Good in Theory Not as Good in Practice 
On the fence about this product...maybe an actual fence would work better! 
Problems out of the box 
Not Rocket Science 
Counterintuitive 
Wait And See 
Clever Solution to a Serious Problem 
Early returns are good.

Seems to work for now but can't be sure-Spray leaves visible residue 
Not Havahart's best 
Great If The Cup Was Not So Flimsy 
Easy to use 
Expensive and the cup arrived broken into several pieces 
Works But Hard To Spray 
Works in some instances but not around bird feeders...squirrels are addicted to those 'fast food meals'

OOPS! 
Perfect refill for heavy duty use

Requires some heft on new construction 
SO SO 
Itw okay 
According to the State of California these tools contain lead.

Overpriced...but certainly usable... 
So-so bench that came with one broken piece and other damaged pieces 
Arrived broken 
Some Assembly Required 
Okay but not perfect 
Good fire pit. Not bad but not great either. 
Durable and attractive but poorly machined so the parts don't fit well. 
Don't leave it outdoors! 
Limited use but it might be right for you. 
Mixed review

Works if you use a lot 
Used around our birdfeeders

Easy to use my dog was attracted to the area where I buried them.

Unsure 
Hard to tell if it works.

This may work but.... 
Looks promising. 
Don't notice any difference

Works about as well as peanut butter. 
Nothing really wrong with the product

OK Not great.  Look for other possible alternatives 
Average seed 
Little more than an appetizer to our birds!  Hardly a success! 
It will blow over in high winds. 
Difficult to make straight edge. 
Mediocre

Large Capacity Feeder That Won't Leak -- Until You Remove It 
Great!  *May 17-Change in my rating...sad! 
An OK Product But I Prefer Planting Flowers To Attract Hummingbirds 
I prefer smaller feeders and here's why. . . . 
Not My Favorite Perky-Pet Hummingbird Feeder 
Toss away the nasty food. 
Hummers Avoid This One Most of the Time 
The Hummingbirds Give it a Five / I Give it a Three 
large on volume - fewer refills required 
Huge capacity but difficult to clean the base 
All setup and ready to go 
Not Great for Knotty Pieces 
Works but not for 4 months 
Time 
Only effective at close range and as a surprise for skunks 
Had hoped for more. 
Not bad 
eh?  so/so 
Fantastic for two seasons but no more 
Arrived bent but worked out OK 
Interesting concept

Works in \perfect\ soil but gets caught in anything else 
Haven't caught a gopher yet 
Hard to rate... 
Bird Feeder 
Not Really That Impressed And Could Be Dangerous For Birds 
Nice feeder but the squirrels win again 
Mediocre feeder 
Maryland birds weren't interested -- until I forced the issue 
Does Not Live Up To Its Name 
Squirrel-proof....and bird-proof too 
It's okay...but the look is clunky 
Looks nice but the birds won't use it 
Not Quite Ready For Prime Time 
A little on the cheap side 
Ok I guess but needed string to tie against side of pool 
It's okay 
Peat Pot 
UPDATE-Return IF 2nd hose just rec'd - see additional pictures. 
Works ok 
About what we thought on hindsight...

Good But Not Great In My Opinion 
No way will this hold 175 feet of 5/8\ hose
