Didn't fit my 1996 Fender Strat... 
HAS TO GET USE TO THE SIZE 
maybe not the best but it serves it's purpose 
Standard guitar cable 
average cable 
Good for the Price 
Does Its Job 
There used to be better stuff 
kinda worked kinda didn't 
Thin cables... 
Not bad but the Cool Cat line is $4 more and a better build 
A reasonably decent capo that you can afford to leave somewhere 
Just an ok capo 
Silk and steel strings 
OK 
lot of money for foam 
My mistake for buying sight unseen. 
Nice Guitar but sounds 
3 Stars Good value but it needed a lot of work 
Not mahogany.... 
Great design - love the switch 
Disapointed in Planet Waves 
The most basic of basic distortion pedals 
It's been around for decades but..... 
Great just not what I was looking for in sound 
Using it for Danelectro Mini Amp 
Step to turn on/off 
serious musicians look elsewhere 
Too much noise 
Durability Issues with Potentiameter 
Not Enough Pressure For A Mandolin 
So far so good but may have found something much better. 
Screws strip too easy but good if you can screw in 
Good 
Works but had to \ruin\ a strap for everything else. 
Aquila is better 
It gets the job done. That's what matters right? Aha.... 
Three Stars 
Provides Some Protection 
Not Bad Picks... 
Not Bad 
They work 
A lightweight contender 
Good strings for the money! 
Not the right feel 
Good picks with ok grips 
Gator Grip? 
So-so 
Good & Bad 
These Are Purple Not Black!! 
Stubby is right 
OK 
Small Hard Good for Lead Guitarists Only! 
Good pick not great 
Good just not for me 
Too small 
Depends on what you're playing 
Nice pick but try the XL 
OK but nothing special 
Strikes and gutters ups and downs. 
Not what I would grab to play with 
Not sticky enough 
Better than nothing 
Nothing Special 
OK? 
does the trick 
Planet Waves Humidifier 
Simple Product Kind of Inconvenient 
meh. 
Good product idea could causes problems for some people. 
Works not great. 
cheap 
Nothing Special 
regular. 
Using Pedals With it is a Mixed Bag 
It's ok 
slippery and young
