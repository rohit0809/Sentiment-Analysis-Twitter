All green teas are not created equal 
It's alright 
Hmmm--more like tropical medley? 
GREAT FOR THE PRICE BUT JUST AN AVERAGE HERBAL TEA. 
Taste-wise fine however irritates prostate

Cocount Water 
No too bad - but there are better ones 
Not what I expected.  Not terrible but wouldn't buy it again. 
You Cannot  Judge This Drink From Its Container 
Definitely an acquired taste 
Formula doesn't quite work for my palate 
Not Your Fathers Fruit Drink 
Best when chilled 
ONE SKIMPY SAMPLE FOR REVIEW 
The taste isn't to my liking 
Very Dry but They Still Taste OK 
Fine 
Delicious But a Bit Too Dense 
Summary 
Not the best quality 
Good Price Great Taste Too many Ingredients 
Mediocre Olives 
Not the best 
If you are looking for anchovies look elsewhere. 
I wish these olives tasted better 
Decent quality panko bread crumbs 
Entirely Adequate 
Okay But not Neccessary! 
Mighty dry 
My son doesn't like them 
Nobody in my family likes these 
Fresh tasting 
A Tasty Treat 
Good for a carbonated tea 
Good if you like green tea 
Piquant Pilaf 
It's alright but I find the seasoning a bit too strong 
Not as good flavor as I hoped for. 
Way Too Spicy! 
I'll stick with the Kitchens of India Butter Chicken Curry Paste instead... 
Excellent Taste But Extremely Sweet 
Sugar Rush 
Not as good as I had hoped 
Tasty - but this one is a bit off 
good meatloaf so-so potatoes TONS of salt 
Not too bad!

OK but not the best 
Surprised; good teriyaki flavor for this kind of product 
Yummy 
Quick fix!

Not quite chicken and dumplings 
Where the meat?!! 
Convenient but not great 
Handybut-- 
One can probably make this chowder delicious but it surely doesn't come that way. 
Not bad 
The chowder is great but most of my cans came squashed... 
Not that great 
Canned chowder 
Roland Kadota Figs in Light Syrup 
Not so Peachy Keen 
Not the rockstar almond butter it claims to be 
Great tea high price on Amazon 
no big deal 
So so 
Toffee taste is great...but... 
Toffee Stevia liquid sweetener 
Okay 
Not very sweet and has a slight chemical taste 
Good but really sweet 
Great Price Okay Tea. 
No better than regularly shaped tea bags. Not worth the extra cost. 
Too Good to Be True? 
Not what I am looking for 
A little too coarse for my tastes but I am going to grind it up finer. 
I'm kind of 'Meh' about this one ... 
Heard wonders but not so much 
The quality may be there but the taste isnt 
great taste 
Unusual taste 
Tastes like other unpasteurized honey but far more expensive 
A bit weak 
Extremely mild taste very low acidity 
Smooth but with a bitter after-taste 
Tastes OK & It Is  Low Acid 
It was \okay\ but not a 'gourmet' coffee 
Puroast Low Acid Coffee 
No heartburn but not great taste 
Ok but not as good as regular cold brewed 
May be good for others 
Smooth though not robust dark roast 
Decent 
Sure was hoping.... 
A Mild Brew for Acid Sufferers 
An Adequate Cup of Coffee 
OK but needs to be cheaper! 
I won't be switching to Puroast

The magic is in the grind 
Decent flavor not outstanding 
low acid coffee 
Solution in Search of a Problem

Cuppa Joe for Hearburn Sufferers 
Average coffee no discernable difference in acid content 
Not what I expected 
Tastes good but kicks off my reflux 
Promising 
Not great 
Definitely low acid but slightly low on flavor too 
Nice if your stomach needs the low acidity 
It says pack of 10 three ounce bags just got one! 
Just okay 
It is definitely coffee 
Low marks for flavor and fragrance. 
Just \Okay\ Low Acid Coffee 
Like watered down & weak Turkish coffee 
I still had heartburn with Puroast 
Tastes the same as Starbucks. 
Weak Aroma And Taste Just OK 
Mild with a nutty aroma 
Low Acid-Weak Taste 
Hard to tell 
Low acid but lacks flavor 
Nothing To Write Home About 
A bit bland but not a bad alternative 
I am on the fence... 
In the end it's the taste that matters 
Soothing to stomach. Unappealing taste. 
Too Expensive Somewhat Bitter 
Not my cup of coffee... 
Good... if you need it 
OK 
DARK French Roast?  It's bland and weak...... 
A Decent Average Coffee 
A Great Crunch but a Poor Flavor
