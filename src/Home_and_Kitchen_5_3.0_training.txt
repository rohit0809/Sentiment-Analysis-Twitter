Good for what it's worth 
Okay 
Disappointed again! 
First time buying a Wilton yearbook. Won't do it again 
I hoped for more 
Not what I was expecting 
very basic! 
Ok but nothing super exciting 
You get what you pay for...kinda 
Cute design but not good for long term use. 
cover fell off 
Good for certain things 
too young to be talking about the good old days 
cheap 
pretty short for adults 
Pretty but flimsy 
Not quite what we 
Just a food chopper 
SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED. 
Not made to the same standards as older devices 
Not as good as the large ones 
not impressed! 
decent for what it is 
Ten minute's use requires fifteen minute's cleaning. 
Does the job 
Good for very fine fast chopping 
Hit or miss... 
Paddle broke within 2 months 
good but could be better 
good for sobet not for an ice cream 
Not exactly instant gratification 
Makes great ice cream but motor has problems 
The ice cream maker makes clunky noises and doesn't always work correctly 
Louder than my dishwasher!!! 
Some other fittings may not work with this fitting 
Works. Not without duck tape 
Work great reliable but use lots of power. Buy digital ones. 
it didn't work at first 
Avoid if you have small kids 
Ok for the Price 
Not blown away... pun intended 
Probably the best available today but 
Ability to move air is limited 
Pros and Cons

Eureka 
cargo box 
Lasko fan OK 
Does what its's supposed to do but 
Vacuum Cleaner 
Okay vacuum for the price. 
cheap parts 
Pretty good overall very good for the price 
A powerhouse of a canister vac but... 
Can be annoying 
Not As Advertised. Kill-A-Watt shows it as a 10 amp motor... 
Decent but not great 
The little vac that almost could... 
Vacuum OK Flimsy but still works 
Ok for quick sweeps 
Just got it!  It is heavier than I expected. 
There are better options available... 
Has a hard time picking up anything but Lint. 
Almost perfect 
Works very well on small jobs like spots. Extremely LOUD. 
Unit can tip over! 
It turns the beater bar 
Belt 
Haven't used it yet

OK but the Rada is much better 
Not too impressed

As expected - at least for lemons 
Works with a  little tweaking 
I'm Not Impressed 
As ricers go this one is really nice. 
Only one size 
Very hard to press 
Potato Ricer 
Smaller that I anticipated 
Gets the job done but could be better. 
Could be better 
Three stars = it's okay 
Rust 
Not up to the OXO standard. 
Wooden Version is Better 
It's OK. I prefer my wooden one. 
Great until... 
after two years... 
good pullup locking mechanism 
VERY long for kitchen use 
OXO rubber doesn't hold up over time 
Okay but harder to control 
A Nice Solid Unit But Wire Is Fragile 
just \okay\...  maybe a little better now (read add-on) 
The locking mechanism broke 
Okay Until It's Not 
Meh 
Its ok 
It's worth the money 
Basic winged corkscrew without bottle opener 
OK Corkscrew But Mostly Plastic 
I'd keep looking elsewhere--this is just okay.... 
Doubtful of longevity

Half the time Cork gets Split 
Way too big.. 
Liked older version better 
Very useful but annoying 
Newer Model Not an Improvement 
Takes up a lot of room 
My old one is better 
OK but I like the Softworks model better. 
Lid keeps breaking 
The top and outer basket were fine. 
Take it from someone who makes 12-14 salads a week... 
Large is really medium-sized 
Great at what it does... but.... 
It was great but the internal mechanism was plastic 
Disappointed!

Limited in applications 
Flexible 
Lost its edge... and a few stars in the rating 
Well built but basic tech 
Mash them Taters 
No so great. 
Simply above average 
not up to the GoodGrips name 
Best Feature Is Also The Worst... 
Better than a regular ice cube tray 
Very wide 
bulky and expensive 
Could be better 
great tray but the price stinks 
Not the best Oxo product 
It's okay... 
Handy but could be sturdier 
Oxo vs Zyliss seafood picks + Progressive seafood scissors

Handle is horrible 
Not as \Super Fine\ as described 
Check Out OXO's Other Pie Server First 
The Stainless Steel start rusting... 
lightweight but ok

Strong material scrapes my pans. 
O 
Decent bowl but needs a couple of tweaks 
Basic mixing bowl 
Whistle blows and so does their customer service

Great scraper don't call it a chopper 
Not a chopper 
Useful!!

I used to love it 
There are cheaper and better options to save your wine 
good 
Has other uses too. 
Keeps chilled bottles cooler longer -- really doesn't chill a warm one

Good starter tool for the price frustrating for multiple / large batches 
Slow stuffing 
False description... 
One batch and the Fettuccine cutter failed.

A simple no frills grinder. 
It works but I'm concerned about the long haul...

A bit disappointing 
It's OK 
Good Idea Questionable Durability 
A bit of a pain in the butski 
It's okay

First Impression Not the Best 
Excellent fresh-tasting water but a few \gotchas\ 
Good water if you can accept some design flaws 
Water tastes great!  Pitcher needs some work. 
Had to return 
flakey 
At this price just buy another Brita Slim Pitcher 
It does what it is supposed to 
Cornered market

Could be better 
Does not work with the new Unison line 
Very solid but kind of inconvenient 
Not the Calphalon You Remember from 80s/90s
