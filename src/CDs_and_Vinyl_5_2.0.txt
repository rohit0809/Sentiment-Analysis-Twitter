What on Earth was going through their minds?!!! 
A BIG disappointment 
Poor DVD of a great band 
If you are expecting the \Queen of Disco\ as you knew her way back when well it's not on this performance 
it should have been 90:99 not 93:99 
A great concert to attend only a mediocre one to buy. 
A disappointing DVD - but not a total loss

Not convinced 
Take it for what it is.... 
There's a BIG Reason It's Pronounced \Yawn-eeeee\ 
Yaaaaaaaawn - eee  . . . . .( wake me when it's over) 
Not Good 
ok 94' hiphop.. 
Hard Core??? Thats A New Definition (Rating 5 out of 10- -2.5 stars)

Not what I expected 
Why was this junk even featured in a TV ad? 
Insipid pedestrian 
Nick Drake is overrated... 
Fans can never be objective... 
fun uptempo tunes but didn't enjoy the pop and droopy ballads 
This cd had an all star cast but came up short......... 
Slow down Maestro ! 
a voice teacher and early music fan 
Too much of the muezzin 
A cool period-flavored German Requiem that leaves no real impression 
Be sure you like &quot;original instruments&quot; before you buy! 
HORRIBLE Sound! 
Exciting Peformance Poorly Recorded 
ehh... 
Sorry but this album is pure poop 
Large Disapointment 
Trash(ed)

I like a bunch of other bands that are supposed to be similar but this music is boring to me 
Binge and dirge 
Give it a miss 
Borefest 
Well This Is What It Would Sound Like 
\S**T\ 
Band sounded really sloppy and much of the show drags... 
I liked about half of it 
By far this band's weakest effort 
A couple OK songs but too artsy for me 
Tool? Heavy metal? 
Oh Gimme an Aenima! 
thinking man's band for the average joe 
Prog-influenced?  I Think NOT... 
Tool - heavy metal 
Inconsistent and way overrated 
Lots of boring wankery with some interesting moments 
not for the tool fan 
BRITISH POLITICS 
I'd almost rather listen to Outside the Gate! 
Not many of my favorite classics on this one 
Only three good songs. \Masterpiece\? Nonsense! Don't believe the hype! 
Lackluster to my ears 
Tending to title track 
Bowie at his strangest...and that's not a good thing. 
Bowie's first big transformation. 
'Money-maker'- 
Cubic Zirconia 
always struggled with this one 
A thankfully short aberation with two good songs 
Bad Bowie. 
A bit dull. 
Bowie goes Philly soul. 
Clearly Not His Best 
Worst of the \Classics\ 
Horribly average 
Worth A Listen  But Not a Must-Have 
Very Over Rated 
Massively overrated 
HIGH 
Disappointing 
maybe transitionally important but not a good album

A hint of things to come 
Frank's worst blunder: poorly re-recorded masterpiece 
Start Cryin' Zappa Fans: This Is NOT VERY GOOD..... 
more lumps than gravy 
Curious Zappa novices beware 
Wasn't quite ready for this one 
Avoid the \colorized\ CD and get the original if you can find it. 
A ruined version of a great album 
Find the Vinyl version and add two stars. 
Zappa loses his audience on this one 
Really really over rated 
descuido prolijo de un genio..... 
Not Frank at his best 
Imagine me and you. 
Highly over-rated by paid critics; I found this boring and mediocre 
Great Album. Poor Vinyl. 
Half-Baked Dada 
A low point in the Zappa collection 
A CLASSIC DESTROYED 
UGH...not the brightest moment in a career 
I don't get it 
Aw come on...this is crap 
A road map please? 
Annoying record 
JOE'S GARAGE: ACTS I II AND III (ZAPPA RECORDS/1979) 
Rip off remaster 
Musically uninteresting and lyrically dated 
Oh Frank what happened? 
Without a doubt Zappa's worst and least interesting album 
bueno  esta bien hasta los genios la pifian alguna vez....... 
The Weakest Zappa Instrumental Album 
I'd rather it be neither them or us 
Ick. My personal vote for the worst Zappa effort... 
Fish been laying on the dock too long 
Does Music belong in Humor? 
Zappa meets Firesign Theatre but he didn't get the drift 
Nice Bass Relief..... but... 
Full of intellect perhaps but sterile. 
Advanced yes amusing no 
Not one of Frank's better releases . 
Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar minus the charm 
Annoying snippets 
You're No Fun Any More 
Uh how should I put this... 
Like most comedy albums good for 1-3 listens only 
Hard on the ears 
One last rodeo before setting sail 
Flat frights 
You know how people complain about albums with only one good song on them? 
I don't get it... what is she still doing here? 
so bad it's kinda good....

Bobby Goldsboro / All Time Greatest Hits 
The reason this is not a good album... 
WEak ! 
Just Decent 
Another spotty compilation from Curb Records 
Great Songs bad product 
Watch out!  They say these are not originals 
A tale of two Unchained Melody's this collection contains re-recordings buyer beware! 
WARNING:  Mostly Rerecordings 
It's Sad When The Best Available Is A Curb Product 
NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS!! 
Not the original releases 
Sad Indeed 
Don Mclean wasting time on Curb records. 
That's not rock and roll anymore...

Nice try but you are no E.L.O. 
Starts to go downhill at this point 
weak compilation 
OK album but her next two albums were better 
BAD! 
For Bloomfield completists only 
What a Bummer 
Another Curb So-Called \Best of\ With Notable Omissions 
Terribly Overdone 
Fantastic voice + hackneyed songs = bad LP 
It would have helped if she didn't sing too LOUD on this one! 
Studio problem? 
Mary Goes pop? 
sophomore effort falls flat on its grape 
Well at least they tried 
Don't Buy This Trash! 
exellent musicians putrid sounding cd.
