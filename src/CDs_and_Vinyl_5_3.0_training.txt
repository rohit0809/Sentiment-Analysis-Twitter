Misfortune of virtue again. 
Handel vs. Sellars 
A voice teacher and early music fan 
To err is Sellars although the singing is divine...

Good 
Should have been better! 
STOMP 
Less than expected 
Not for operatic fans.

too short and too long.... 
An odd experience -- 
I love Woodstock but . . . 
Ultimate Collector's Edition not worth the added expense 
Either the end or the beginning of a dream... 
Less Would Be More 
Da Woodstock Nation Whatever..... 
Woodstock - Blu-ray Info

Conservative performance lacklustre video production 
Classical Music on DVD - like CD's twenty years ago! 
THIS GUY THINKS HE'S BIGGER THAN BEETHOVEN!!!!!  Not! 
Not the best one from Karajan! 
Interesting 
Excellent performance poor video

Pleasant but be forewarned: this is about Sesame Street NOT Elmo! 
Wasn't he always unplugged? 
Love Tony but... 
WHERES THE COMPLETE FOOTAGE? 
Where is the rest of the concert? 
The music too-often takes a back seat to the promoters. 
Great Festival Bad Film 
Good concert footage -- but its a rocumentary first 
the last the largest it could be better 
Controversy? Yes... Music? Not enough 
A True picture of the love and peace era.

Sound Quality 
Disappointed 
Get God Is In The Tv Instead 
Dead to the Viewer 
Marilyn Manson is NOT a normal person 
It's okay 
Great Movie - Mixed Feelings on this edition 
For TON fans but probably not for vampire/movie buffs 
ok 
odd  new Lou Reed.c.d. 
Blondie are doing it for themselves 
Fancy that fancy this. 
Foot at an angle 
Good CD 
Pretty much what you would expect 
This Won't Last 
Its OK but nothing special  with nothing resembling VH 
That's a little more like it..... 
Pitch-correction and mediocre songs - still better than most. 
Not as good as the first one! 
Alright Alright 
Nice Try 
Van Halen rejects don't add up to Van Halen 
Its Slash... 
its ok  not great the singer sounds the same on every song! 
To Be Honest... 
Decent enough follow-up to a brilliant debut 
not my favorite 
a decent album from slash 
Not up to the last Slash album 
Decent Album 
Good album 
Probably my Least Favorite Rush Album 
PLEASE remaster this fine record!! 
After 5 Years of Waiting a Big Disappointment 
It is another Rush Jam Album 
...they just keep powering on - more power to em' 
Starts strong a little repetitive in the middle an uplifting end and a nicely illustrated digital booklet 
Bring back Terry Brown! 
No philosophy consoles me in a clockwork universe. 
Oh if only Terry Brown could get his fingers on this sonic mess 
louder-Louder-LOUDER!!!!! 
Some good songs but mostly ordinary and repetitive 
It is fair to criticize 
Poor mixing/mastering damaged one of their better albums 
Dissapointed a bit 
Not a favorite but not a skeet target either. 
An ambitious work marred by suffocating homogenizing production 
Hmm.... 
I was so ready to love this but... 
They Tried Too Hard 
Geddy Lee just doesnt have it together anymore... Vocal - wise. 
Five stars? Really? Please be sincere! 
SOME GOOD MOMENTS..... 
They are no angels but work like a clock 
Concept lost. This ain't no Hemispheres 
Hmmm! 
A challenging listen..... 
Time to dump Nick Raskulinecz 
I love this album and the new Lovari album 
sick of digital 
Great by today's standards but not one of Rush's best 
Great Rush album damaged by what sounds like poor mastering 
Meh... 
I expected more but it's ok 
Hope Is What Remains to be Seen 
disappointed

Not a bad start for an up-and-coming band 
Good singer- okay music 
A Strong Debut 
Not as good as there EP

Well... After Reading All The Reviews... 
Skillet is alright but not the most solid album ever 
More like two and a half but I'm being nice.... 
Just can't beat Collide this time.. 
I really wanted this album to be as good as Arriving but: 
Progressive Rock with a Heavy Edge 
6.5/10 
Not as good as I remembered 
Reminiscences gone astray 
Not Bad for a White Boy! 
Radical Changes 
too harsh for my taste 
I'll rate it 3 stars for now!! 
WRONGHEADED...This is so greatly BAD 
When questionable intentions go wrong-You have to hear this!!! 
3 stars for being hilarious; 0 for musical talent 
It is what it is 
Total is significantly less than the sum of the parts 
Admirable - As \Swan Lake\ Goes. . . 
I recommend the DVD of the Swedish Ballet as First Choice 
Sing it&#8230; 
Laziness to release this on DVD speaks volumes 
Three and-a-half really. Good but not as good as 'Tales from Margaritavision'. But get both while you can! 
Much more available footage that wasn't given to us.... 
There's nothing like a Grateful Dead concert... 
Mostly unobjectionable 
WHAT?!!  No bonus features?! 
Vintage clips are great - the rest is well.... 
Exposed 
Decent video but had most on other KISS DVDs

Unintentionally Hilarious! 
Dancing Days are hear again! 
Remastering is Great Bonus DVD is Great...but the PACKAGING SUCKS! 
It's unfortunate that this is all we have... 
It's a concert  \CLIP\ 
Not bad at the time 
Great music but. . . 
Good for Zep fanatics. Loses its charm for others. 
Heavily edited 
Better off with the 2003 set 
Led Zeppelin 
Led Zeppelin: The Song Remains The Same - Blu-ray Info

I'd like to say this movie was great but..... 
Inaccurate but highly entertaining and bizarre film best taken as a cult curiosity.  Mediocre DVD treatment though 
A punk classic...you might as well see it.

Good show but can we get a more current one? 
could be better 
Good except for Tannhauser himself 
Well almost.... 
It Grows On You 
ok onli 
Well-crafted but can be quickly tiring 
By far their worst. 
Not as great as it should have been 
Who are we kidding?!! 
20 years later not much has changed 
Not essential but very solid Steely Dan 
Not like the first ones 
Jazz Funkelastic White Boys still Rock! 
Great concept disappointingly executed 
Two Against ...any interest at all. 
Fine CD...But Lacks Great Songs 
babylon brothers 
Steely Dan needs rhythm energy 
Reeling in the Years......... 
Middle of the Road..... 
Yeah the 70's are over but the albums endure 
Way Deep Into Nothing Special 
This is just good enough to buy 
Good Concert  With Engineering Mishap 
where's the centre channel?? 
Pretty Good until She fades 
DTS with no center channel 
Great production cast despite vocal problems of Pendatchanska 
Feelin' so good or not? 
A bit boring in the beginning 
Solid Performance but Disc Exhibits Playback Problems 
Il manque Wakeman! 
psssss 
A brave set full of new songs 
Great visuals but where's the bass? 
You don't really need it 
One new episode doesn't quailfy for a new tape 
end summer revisit 
Misunderstood but not the masterpiece it's made out to be... 
A man is born lives and dies 
The Wall 
To much of roger waters is not a good thing 
An overrated album.... 
WARNING-NO YOUNG LUST! 
A flawed but compelling look at rock stardom 
the most overrated pf album 
The deal's been made.... 
You missed the point. 
Good concept suffers from band loss 
Slick bombastic -- but not a lot of substance 
Definitely a mixed bag 
Does not require buy-in. 
Waters dominated effort hurtling toward a dark and dreary place 
This review is just Another Brick In The Wall... 
Over-rated and unremarkable 
Is it the best or worst Pink Floyd? 
Too much \concept\ not enough \album\. 
I'll go on record and say this.. 
Uneven Wildlly Overrated 
Dissapointing 
Only a few good bricks... 
you have to be in the mood 
Don't  believe the fans...... 
Uncomfortably Numb 
The Wanking Wall 
This is not Pink Floyd!! 
Not as good as original 
The ultimate High School Album and Skating Song 
Average Pink Floyd (3 and a half stars) 
The Wall 
Overrated and self-indulgent 
Overrated 
One of Floyd's Most Popular (and Annoying) Albums 
Overrated but very good... 
Excellent album but constantly blown out of porportion 
Commercial success - Ego inflation - Loss of Floyd sound. 
Heating Up Christian Rock 
Get the cd The book is an acquired taste I suppose. 
Actually I give it 2 and 1/2 stars 
Lovely but can get a bit monotonous 
Melodically Interesting Sonically Dated 
Yanni mix 
A paradoxical bump in the rapid slide into mediocrity. 
Going... going....nearly gone! 
Not my favorite but still good 
Life After Love 
Quarter collaboration 
A Mediocre Effort 
Latte Music 
Is this a new take on Melrose or simply a re-release on another label? 
Good yes.  Great no. 
DISAPPOINTING 
Very Lovely A Little Morose 
What the Hell? 
Not Her Best 
Good Not Great 
\Dare to Dream\- Yanni 
Good Not Great 
A few fun numbers for fans. 
Same old schmaltz 
A gratifying compilation 
not Etta at her best but good if you are an Etta James fan 
Expectation Much Greater Than Reality 
I've Tried Oh How I've tried 
Disappointing 2 and a half stars maybe.... 
5 Stars for The Pokrovsky Singers/2 for Paul Winter 
A Good album 
\Can I stroke you up!\ 
Keep it slow ladies... 
The Kingz of Rock 
If It Ain't Broke... 
Not as tight as their first album 
Great voice that needs to be washed with soap 
Hard Core by Lil Kim (*Back in the Day Series*) 
Sorry y'all I just wasn't feeling it 
Lil' Kim?????? 
Is this the same woman who made Notorious K.I.M & LBM? 
One of the top modern female rappers 
Too much Kim!! 
Decent effort from DJ Pooh 
It's Ok 
Lightning in a bottle (3.5/5) 
Crush on you was my  cut 
3 and 1/2 star effort--aged well in some spots not in others 
PALE BY COMPARISON 
A Great Single A Wonderful First Album but... 
Two-fer of mid-60s UK vocal group's albums + bonus cuts 
Good quality sound but not up to par 
hard to find music 
the well is running dry 
Budgie's 2nd phase 
Okay... 
What's Good Is Cherce But.... 
Mixed deck 
Wouldn't pay too much for it 
Mid '70's return 
Best be your own judge 
It grows on you... 
A good start -- but only a start 
Uneven often strange with blasts of brilliance 
ian 
Amon Duul - 'Psychedelic Underground' (Repertoire) 3 1/2 stars 
Sehr seltsamer Sound 
This is a different band then Amon Duul 2 
Renaissance goes pop! 
Solid Solo Outing 
High Schmaltz 
Roger Daltrey - 'Daltrey' (Repertoire) 
Not the correct Procol harem format I wanted-my error 
cream of the crop 
For the Better Moments Worth the Price 
While the live portion captures the band's proficiency for long jams this is not up to the standard of the album before 
Thunder 
A great single CD's worth of material stretched to 2 CDs 
Disappointed withthe sound quality. 
They Hadn't Quite Figured Out How to Record Loud Bands Yet 
creams wheels of fire still burn somewhat! 
This is not what Cream deserves to be remembered for 
Fresh Cream 
Blues and bluesy rock'n'roll debut not their finest. 65/100 
good 
Just a dollop of Cream at their freshest!! 
Decent...Not a classic 
A Crazy Sound from a Crazy Band
