You Cannot  Judge This Drink From Its Container

Formula doesn't quite work for my palate 
Not Your Fathers Fruit Drink 
Best when chilled

Very Dry but They Still Taste OK 
Fine 
Delicious But a Bit Too Dense

Not the best 
If you are looking for anchovies look elsewhere. 
I wish these olives tasted better 
Decent quality panko bread crumbs 
Entirely Adequate 
Okay But not Neccessary! 
Mighty dry 
My son doesn't like them 
Nobody in my family likes these 
Fresh tasting 
A Tasty Treat 
Good for a carbonated tea 
Good if you like green tea 
Piquant Pilaf 
It's alright but I find the seasoning a bit too strong 
Not as good flavor as I hoped for. 
Way Too Spicy! 
I'll stick with the Kitchens of India Butter Chicken Curry Paste instead... 
Excellent Taste But Extremely Sweet 
Sugar Rush 
Not as good as I had hoped 
Tasty - but this one is a bit off 
good meatloaf so-so potatoes TONS of salt

Canned chowder 
Roland Kadota Figs in Light Syrup

So so 
Toffee taste is great...but... 
Toffee Stevia liquid sweetener 
Okay 
Not very sweet and has a slight chemical taste 
Good but really sweet 
Great Price Okay Tea. 
No better than regularly shaped tea bags. Not worth the extra cost. 
Too Good to Be True? 
Not what I am looking for 
A little too coarse for my tastes but I am going to grind it up finer. 
I'm kind of 'Meh' about this one ... 
Heard wonders but not so much 
The quality may be there but the taste isnt 
great taste 
Unusual taste 
Tastes like other unpasteurized honey but far more expensive 
A bit weak 
Extremely mild taste very low acidity 
Smooth but with a bitter after-taste 
Tastes OK & It Is  Low Acid 
It was \okay\ but not a 'gourmet' coffee 
Puroast Low Acid Coffee 
No heartburn but not great taste 
Ok but not as good as regular cold brewed 
May be good for others 
Smooth though not robust dark roast 
Decent 
Sure was hoping....

The magic is in the grind

Cuppa Joe for Hearburn Sufferers 
Average coffee no discernable difference in acid content 
Not what I expected

Promising 
Not great 
Definitely low acid but slightly low on flavor too 
Nice if your stomach needs the low acidity 
It says pack of 10 three ounce bags just got one! 
Just okay 
It is definitely coffee 
Low marks for flavor and fragrance. 
Just \Okay\ Low Acid Coffee 
Like watered down & weak Turkish coffee 
I still had heartburn with Puroast 
Tastes the same as Starbucks. 
Weak Aroma And Taste Just OK 
Mild with a nutty aroma 
Low Acid-Weak Taste 
Hard to tell 
Low acid but lacks flavor 
Nothing To Write Home About 
A bit bland but not a bad alternative 
I am on the fence... 
In the end it's the taste that matters 
Soothing to stomach. Unappealing taste. 
Too Expensive Somewhat Bitter 
Not my cup of coffee... 
Good... if you need it 
OK 
DARK French Roast?  It's bland and weak...... 
A Decent Average Coffee 
A Great Crunch but a Poor Flavor

Not authentic but works well as a quick base for adding other ingredients... 
Plain tea 
Convenient serving 
Taste could be better 
Cute but.... 
Better to just get individual flavors 
Ok flavor 
Extremely subtle flavor. A bit too subtle for me. 
I am not a flavored water type of person... I like sweet 
Very limited appeal. 
Not for breakfast at our house 
It's \ok\

Very refreshing but not a flavor that I liked 
Dark Cherry Juice Soda 
Tasty but misleading 
Carbonated Juicy Juice 
130 calories for 8 oz of beverage

Not too shabby. 
pretty good stuff - but not enough to \switch\ 
This is a small portion.  Too sweet not enough tang for Cherry soda. 
Better than expected but not perfect 
Not Good-tasting or Nutritious enough to make me change 
It's still soda!! 
A bit too sweet for my liking 
Switch Black Cherry - 8.3 Ounce Can 
Glad it's natural

Yet another... 
tasty all natural but NOT low-calorie 
Switch?  Maybe Not 
Decent Taste HFCS Free 
OK.  8oz is small 
Great Concept But Tastes Like You're Drinking a Vitamin 
Average Tasting (Like Apple Juice) Drink with 130 Calories 
A healthy alternative 
Not as Good as Kiwi Berry 
Not A Bad Alternative To Soda But Not A Great One Either 
Just \okay\ 
High sugar black cherry drink 
8.3 ounces of expensive mixed juice 
Not enough cherry for me 
Like a juice box but in a can with bubbles.

Pretty standard fruity drink 
Same calories as soda is healthy?? 
Flavored Apple Juice 
Tasty but overpriced 
OK taste 
Expensive! 
Not great

Nice Flavor but Not Much To It 
Nothing Special 
Orange Tangerine Switch 
Overly sweet orange soda 
Gets an A-plus for 100% juice and no HFCS

Good for sipping - a LOT of sugar! 
Not too sweet but not full juice taste 
OK but not my fav 
A drink without a category 
Make the Switch to a Healthier Beverage 
Was not a hit at our house...

The Switch vs. Soda 
I wanted to like it more 
Not what I expected

Low carbonation 100% juice 
Sweet and Carbonated Like Energy Drinks but Without the Sugar 
What's it all about???

Going beyond sugar water + CO2 
Just a soda 
Fizzy Citrus 
A healthier alternative to soda but not overly original 
No corn syrup but way too sweet 
Not for me 
Not that great... 
Torn 
Switch has true tangerine-orange flavors but it's too sweet despite having \no added sugars\. 
Really just bubbles and vitamin C 
not bad but not enough zing 
No sugar but not low-calorie 
Orange-Tangerine Carbonated Fruit Drink 
Tastes Like Carbonated Tang 
Tasty Carbonated Orange Juice 
I wish it were either orange or tangerine. 
The New Juice 
Not bad.  Nothing special about it. 
good ok maybe 
okay but... 
Interesting. Better than Watermelon.

flavor was not for me but some people may like these quite a bit 
I really like these; nutty snacks 
Good except for added ingredients

Weaker than Regular Sleepytime 
Seems to work but it's hard to rinse 
3 stars for convenience little else 
important to know the size 
Picture looks better than the actual item. 
It looks a lot nicer in the picture than in actuality!

Good and Bad 
Good Product.. 
If you are really supersensitive to the aftertaste in Stevia this ain't for you...but it might be fine for cooking.. 
Good price for a sensible amount for home or office use.  Is Truvia safe to use?  We'll see.  Why won't Cargill say whats in it?

Excellent formula packaging mediocre 
Decent gluten free graham crackers 
Look like graham crackers not exacty the same. 
Not like a regular graham cracker. 
Less than perfect substitute for graham crackers. 
Deceiving product but better than regular mayo 
Easy Squeeze Bottle for a great Mayo but mostly soy oil 
Good But Too Sweet 
It's Mostly Soybean Oil 
What can I say? It's mayonnaise...

blue ribbon mission figs 
Good product but... and beware of shipping cost!

soup but small 
Too Much Sodium 
Decent Food Lousy Packaging 
Between 2 and 3 Stars ... 
There are better options 
Gentle formula perfect for teething tummies

A Split Vote! 
Crazy Expensive 
smell better than they taste 
Different 
Strange Flavor But Not Bad Texture

Average... 
Organic Candy 
Firm chewy fruity licorice 
Doesn't beat the cheap stuff 
Hit or miss... family is split 
Flavor is OK pricey 
Differing opinions 
Pretty good although the number one ingredient is wheat. 
My kids liked it I didn't 
Good But Not Exceptional 
Different but made in mexico 
Not bad 
Okay taste but chewier than normal licorice 
A healthy version of the red \vines\...but... 
Acceptable but not wonderful. 
Meh... 
It could have had more flavor. 
Tasty but a little tough 
unusual licorice 
On the Bland Side 
Odd flavor 
Good though a little subtle on the Pomegranate flavor... 
Paul Newman does licorice 
not sweet a bit pasty 
Nice 
Blueberry Honey 
I think it's overpriced. 
It's Brown 
Like very weak coffee 
Try adding a little vanilla almond milk 
Salmon fair 
Great product GROSSLY overpriced (on Amazon)!!!! 
Healthier product but why so much sodium? 
Chef BOYARDEE Whole Grain Lasagna is Surprisingly Tasty but Amazon Prime Shipping left me with 6 out of 12 cans DENTED!

Oreo & Thin Mints in a single cookie 
where's the creme? 
Good cookie but I was expecting an Oreo 
They are OK 
Good 
They're okay but not great. There are far better Oreos 
I'll Be Keeping My Regular Oreo's... 
Filled chocolates; Not much like Oreos. 
Oreo Has Done Better 
Too Creamy 
They were ok. 
Not the oreo you grew up with... mint creme and fudge make it different 
Just okay 
Like a Girl Scout thin mint with white cream 
Just OK 
too sweet 
Good but not minty enough 
It's OK but not something I'd go out and buy for myself.  I'd stick with plain Oreos. 
Underwhelming and quite unlike an Oreo 
I wish Nabisco just dipped Oreos instead! 
Not bad...different 
Stale and looked like somebody played soccer with them 
One year old dislikes all three due to texture 
Mostly vegetable pilaf 
Quick To Go Meal 
Big fan of GoPicnic not a big fan of this offering

Okay for a Gluten Free Hunger Reliever 
They are okay 
Just ok. 
Not too big and not too tasty

It's OK 
Happy to get this on an airplane or for a picnic but not so much for a regular meal.

It's a mixed bag 
Decent but not great. 
Just OK 
Mix-match of good and not so good

Not Happy With My Latest Order 
Good healthy alternative! 
Tasty...but dry. 
Good Product Terrible Packaging!

Okay.  I like the strong mint. 
Not really minty but very spicy 
Not really my cup of tea... 
Another Take on Mint 
Robust European Style Tea 
It's average... 
mint tea 
The taste is very mild - and it was only so so on the energizing 
Delicious but expensive 
Okay taste just not for me. 
Not enough energy... 
A matter of taste 
Nothing special 
Too Mild 
Won't Kill My Coffee Habit But It's Alright 
Good taste Energy? Not so sure 
Great flavor helps me focus but still leaves me with jitters 
The perfect energy might be coming from the caffeine boost instead of the herbs!  It also doesn't have much flavor. 
Great Product Great Price! 
Army brat food.. 
Shipping takes it's toll 
A gift for someone who lives far away and you don't think about that much?

This Will Not Be Making It Into My Breakfast Rotation 
Could be worse should be better 
Almost great but a little too sweet and a little too much vanilla

Not for everyone 
Good to add to soup 
For Skilled Chefs Only. 
A product in need of a better label 
OK 
instructions were wrong 
As Expected

Unable to Review 
Low octane 
Did seem to give me a little boost on a tiring day 
Tasty but Nothing Special 
Pretty tasty energy booster! 
Could be good stuff but... 
It's okay but it's not coffee 
Boost? 
Tasted like lemonade & vitamins 
Tastes Bad and It Doesn't Do Much 
Nothing special a little bitter 
Ick but I think it works 
Meh. 
OK but not for my taste 
Was A Fan .... 
More sugar less protein. 
Eh don't taste much in the way of chocolate 
It is OK! 
A little too heavy on the chocolate flavor (for my tastes)and sort of pricey compared to generic p. butter flour (search online) 
What I think 
I think it was good product I just did not like it. 
not much if any chocolate flavor 
This one is OK 
Very heavy smoky taste 
Not nearly as tasty to me as the Mario kalamata olives 
They're OK 
A good idea... 
softer than I prefer... 
Not what I expected 
Good but not what I expected 
cheese crackers 
Good snacks 
Less than the sum of its parts

Seems Harder to Squeeze Out Than Other brands. 
Misses the mark! 
OK 
A bit runny and bland 
REALLY smooth - more like peanut soup. 
Healthy but different 
Not very spicy but still good 
Better deal than 5 hour energy still expensive. 
I didn't notice any difference in my energy 
Red Rain Energy Shot 
No unpleasant buzz but not as much boost as I like. 
Not as effective as 5-hr Energy 
Pick-me-up Mystery. 
Comparatively not bad... 
The Red Rain Energy Shot tasted good but the drink did not give me a shot of energy. 
Morning eye-opener 
Tastes Better Than \5-Hour\ BUT Less Apparent Effect 
Nothing very noticable 
Less cost less effective but adequate results for a mini-boost 
Great taste great price but not too much boost 
Nice taste but little punch 
Average

Probably wouldn't buy again 
Odd Cheese Taste

Not for my bread machine 
Thick and Hearty 
Good product but flavor may not be for everyone 
Okay idea 
Good deal but tastes like Folgers... 
Okay 
We have the best canned tomatoes in the world here in the USA so there's really not reason to import these from Italy. 
IT'S JUST NOT BABKA! 
Some things I would rave about others....not so much. 
Pretty Tasty 
I'm not sure who this would be for 
This is nothing to get too terribly excited about.

The apple cinnamon version is better. 
Good but not great 
Good but not spectacular

Drywall for your dollhouse

Tastes VERY Familiar 
Sorry a little too sweet for my taste 
Very Crunchy...but too sweet. 
Tastes like \Corn Pops\ and isn't very \nutty.\ 
So-so 
Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Cereal 
Crunchy and nutty but so-so. 
Interesting Alternative to Cheerios 
nothing to crow about 
Yummy treat but lots of sugar 
Where are the nuts? 
Honey Peanut Flavor that is Crunchy 
More of a \Kid\ Cereal 
Super crunchy. Get out your magnifying glass to see a nut. 
Maybe better as a mix 
Reminds me of corn bran... 
Crunchy but not nutty... 
Very sugary and probably not the most healthful cereal 
Can taste the sugar but not the nuts 
Too sweet for me. 
Better flavor Honey Nut Cheerios but \yellow corn meal\? 
Won't be at the Top of the Shopping List 
Doesn't look like package 
Oh!s Get Your Honey-Smackin' Kix 
Not too bad. 
VERY Crunchy but lacked the \nutty\ flavor I was craving

Crunchy Nuts 
Miss the cereals of your youth? 
Well it's crunchy... 
Not my favorite cereal

Bun? 
TOO SWEET ! !  ! 
Good but not Outstanding 
Seems ordinary to my simple taste 
For Dark Aficionados Only 
Didn't taste above and beyond much cheaper brands 
Decent semi-sweet chocolate 
Try the 62% with chocolate nibs--much better! 
Tasty in small doses 
A touch bitter 
Not For Everyone 
Ok dark chocolate Lindt is better 
Extra Dark Chocolate Good for Eating Not so Good for Cooking 
who's going to complain about chocolate? 
82% & fruity 
Thirst quenching but taste not exceptional 
Decent-tasting but some problems 
Tasty chocolate but very light ginger flavoring 
Tasty questionable texture chocolate was melted 
There are better choices out there. 
Not a bad tea cookie 
Bland 
Interesting Taste But With A Few Problems 
Soft and Melted 
Good flavor but needs improvement - chocolate melted 
Bland granola 
Okay Granola 
Ultra Crunchy and Sweet Granola 
Not The Best 
Just fine tasty but unremarkable and a little stingy with the almonds 
Average except for the Agave 
Just OK. 
Healthier than many other granolas but kind of blah 
tastes good but not for vegans 
OK granola but lacking in vanilla and almonds 
Good Flavor 
Pack of 6 is too much 
No crunch 
disappointing because it doesn't taste like tea 
Create a tea 
Awesome tasting convenient tastes great but... 
Great product poor flavor 
Peachy but not peachy keen.

Another pretty good drink mix from MIO 
It's not too bad

Just okay 
Not your mother's peach tea

Great concept but peach flavor is underwhelming 
MIo Peach Tea 
It's ok... 
Could be peachier.

Good Idea 
Not the best 
Better than Mango/Peach and Sweet Tea in my opinion 
Not bad but not good either 
Make your own flavored water 
Tasty 
Nice idea for a product but I don't like this flavor 
Concentrated flavor 
Watch out! 
Not bad taste but really fake coloring 
Delicious at first but leaves a stale after-taste 
Great concept but odd artificial peach taste... 
Taste is very subjective but for me this makes water taste worse than it does out of the tap. 
A Little Goes a Long Way 
Peach in an artificial sort of way also super sweet 
Yummy but some concern over ingredients 
Okay in Small Amounts 
Great Concept Handy and Portable but Very Sweet 
Great idea ok taste 
Decent product good tasting but doesn't seem that cost effective 
A Bit TOO Sweet 
Sweet and sweet... no mango with a hint of peach for me 
OK 
I hated it. My roommate loved it. 
Tastes OK but leaves a strange feeling in back of throat 
Great tasting diet tea... sometimes 
The most I taste it the less I like it 
It Is OK 
taste is OK and it is sweet 
Not our favorite 
Not terrible but I wouldn't buy again 
Not really to my taste 
Tastes great but too artificial for my tastes. 
2% natural = 98% chemical 
An alternative to Crystal Light 
It's Okay 
Cheaper to Buy Flavored Water 
It's okay 
Expensive - but tasty 
HANDY PACKAGING  TASTE OKAY 
Good stuff but not worth the price 
too expensive 
Rather insipid flavor but easy to use 
tasty but not worth it 
Tastes okay . . . for a glassful of chemicals 
Better than the tea! 
No thank you.... 
Not Bad Flavor for Water 
Serving Size = 1/2 tsp. 
Tastes Good. Not Sure If Worth the Money. 
Expensive and Mediocre 
Product arrived spilled. 
Tasty but with an artificial aftertaste. 
It's Ok 
Adult Kool Aid 
I hate it when my water looks like wine 
Beats MiO Sweet Tea 
Pretty good 
portable but difficult to measure 
Concoct your own flavored water 
It's OK but I think I like my water un-enhanced. 
Good taste but a messy travel companion 
Way too sweet if you slavishly follow instructions 
Yeah adds some nice flavor but chemical after-taste... 
Can't taste the mango. 
Tastes good but leaves an after-taste 
Like the taste ... not the packaging 
MIO...How sweet it is.... 
Tea for 24 
Peach flavor tastes artificial.... 
Not bad... 
Not So Peachy 
Well-designed container OK nondescript flavor not too keen about the ingredients 
Careful when opening!  Mixed reviews from family on taste certainly can be useful. 
It's better when I mix it with something else 
It's OK if you like artificial sweeteners 
Expensive Maybe Not Worth the Price 
MIO Strawberry Watermelon 
A big disappointment 
Average at best

Nothing special 
couldn't review this 
OK Flavor.  Mimics Sweet Tea But Not Quite the Same. 
Better than what I expected it to be 
My daughter loves it......and I don't. 
The packaging is ingenious the concept is great... but this flavor was not a hit in this house 
I have a hard time getting the right flavor for this. 
Useful but... 
Great For Athletic People/Gym Rats 
The Third MIO Flavor I've Tried... 
Just okay 
Easy tea ready to dress up as you see fit 
Not quite tea 
FLAVOR DOES NOT EQUAL THE CLEVER IDEA 
Fake tea flavor 
A Nice Surprise! 
Not bad but I wouldn't carry it in my pocket 
Oh Mio Myo You. Whatever Shall We Do? 
Great Idea but Too Much Aftertaste 
Tastes OK and handy but prefer real H2O or tea 
Tastes good & convenient - but hard to judge amount 
It Tastes Better Than Water But..... 
A Nice Treat 
1/2 tsp = a serving; use within a month of opening; no refrigeration required 
Almost did not try this 
It's ok but not a great substitute for the real thing 
Cool design great idea not great flavor. 
Better than plain water but not great 
A good idea

I was expecting x-mas 
Funky aftertaste 
Cute basket with lots of nice chocolates but the truffles didn't look right. 
Quality and Convenience vs. Quantity and Time 
Nice chocolate way too expensive 
5 for flavor; 1 for price. If price is not a factor... 
Fair 
Tea is OK 
Very mild not my cup of tea 
premium fresh stacks 
Tasty review? Not really. Necessary product? Not really either. 
Right-Size Packaging Needs Right-Size Pricing 
Taste fine but trans fat and small package premium 
New concept on an already great product 
Just different packaging 
Did Nabisco change their recipe? 
Interesting 
Not a cookie - more like a digestive biscuit 
newtons tries something different

Tasty cookie from trusted Nabisco but too fragile for shipping 
Not bad but not great either. 
Very tasty snack

Nothing Special 
Reasonable Cookie - Palm Oil is a Concern 
Da Better Flavor but still I've eaten better 
Smelled better than they tasted 
They were just ok for me. 
Decent cookie but horrible aftertaste 
Tastes like a digestive biscuit with vestiges of fig 
mediocre cookies 
Like a graham cracker with fruit 
Tasty but Not as Good as Original Newtons 
Do not think \cookie\ 
Call it a Cinnamon 'Thin' with fig bits for a more accurate name. 
Good but not the best for dieters 
Nothing Special 
Not an exciting product. 
Just okay 
A British Tea Biscuit? Really? 
A bit too sweet

Good taste but be aware  of the packaging unless you want \cookie pieces\ 
Good snack food 
Good compromise for kids snacking 
Tastes like a graham cracker with bits of blueberry... 
flavor vs aftertaste

Stack-a-licious! 
Familiar taste new packaging worth the price?

A half honey graham cracker is still a honey graham cracker 
Fresh Stack Honey Grahams 
Still got stale easily but a nice thought

Same treat... a little better package 
Good For On The Go 
Fresh and yummy but was delivered as mostly crumbs

Normal goldfish

Brownie mix 
Info wrong 
Disappointed long-time fan of the Krusteaz brand 
Somewhat disappointed 
Looks great - Tasted odd 
Sugar Overload! 
Tasty not entirely unhealthy VERY sweet 
not much healthier than \regular\ caramel popcorn 
totally delicious BUT.... 
Tasty But Not Necessarily Worth the Calories/Price 
Caramel Corn = YUM! (fudge drizzle = meh.) 
I would pass 
Cracker Jacks without the Nuts!

Okay 
Delicious but diminutive 
It's all sugar baby! 
Salty & Sweet But Not Healthier 
Pretty Good but still using corn syrup 
Smartly packaged...but painfully sweet 
Sweet treat 
Decent but would be better without the cheap \fudge\ 
An OK treat 
Sweet and Crunchy 
More fudge-y than carame-ly! 
Over priced for the product 
Depends on What You're Looking For... 
Very very sweet not diet food 
A Bit On The Sweet Side 
Eh What more can I say? 
Chocolate & Popcorn 
Portion control and taste! 
Popcorn Caramel & Chocolate Fix all in one 
Good calorie count but perhaps too sweet 
Good size but just too sweet 
*Extremely* sweet! 
A quick sweet tooth fix 
just your average caramel popcorn 
Be Careful... They are Deliciously Sweet and Yummy 
You can't snack \well\ with corn syrup

3-1/2 stars: mixed reviews from a single family 
All Sugared Up With Noplace To Go 
Not that great.  Shouldn't be labeled oreos as they really aren't. 
Ok - sweet but lacking in a distinctive flavor March 24 2011 
Lots of calories and sweetness (not a proper Oreo) 
Not what I expected. 
So... rich... 
Tasty but probably not something to order via Amazon 
If I'm going to pay this much for a cookie I'm going to buy it from a little girl in uniform 
average - not as good as expected 
Not Quite as Good As I Dreamed 
Yes But Is It Still An Oreo? 
Girl Scouts \Tagalong\ by a different name. 
Like a Reese 
Not much Oreo flavor slight artificial aftertaste 
Tagalongs! 
Not enough oreo! 
Thin sweet cookies 
An interesting take on Oreo Cookies 
Greasy but addictive. 
Consider your shipping location carefully! 
Pretty Good Cookie but Not Great 
Not what I expected. 
Different but not as good as just-plain Oreoes 
OK but not the best buy 
Tastes good to me but probably not great for health 
Not the best Oreo 
more of candy treat vs a cookie- MESSY ! 
Not overwhelmed. 
Where's the Peanut Butter? 
Good not great. 
Friend liked'em I did not 
In Search of The Peanut Butter Oreo... 
More Candy Than Cookie and Oh So Sweet!

Falls short of Oreo perfection. 
Half an Oreo covered in melty fudge 
Cookie Crunch Lost in Peanut Butter and Fudge Creme 
Peanut Butter Oreos...blech 
Good not great 
Peanut Butter Creme.... 
No really an Oreo. 
Nice idea but bitter aftertaste 
Where is the peanut butter or the fudginess? 
Not As Yummy As I Had Hoped 
Pretty generic cookie all told 
High Goo to Cookie Ratio 
Tasty cookies one star off for outrageous price 
This is for the peanut butter creme not golden variety... 
Continuing with the Girl Scout Cookie Theme Mint are Better 
I'll Stick with the Original Oreos 
SUPER CUTE VERRRYY Sweet smell amazing..a weird review... 
Oreo in name only. 
I would not buy them myself 
Very chocolately but offputting texture. 
Somewhat tastier that what I expected for a somewhat healthier snack 
Not my thing but the kids ate them all

Pretty good but... 
Mixed opinions on fudge creme brownie bite 
They're OK. They taste like tiny brownies. 
Needs more chocolate 
Ersatz product with the hint of brownie 
Not my favorite... 
It was OK not amazing 
Doesn't win an \eat this...not that\ contest 
Neat But Not Moist 
A ho-hum confection 
Not bad but Snackwell has other tastier options 
It's okay 
okay 
Probably not the healthiest. 
Great taste Not healthy enough 
Weird sweet

Not My Cup of Tea 
Don't like them but kids like these 
A bit too punchy 
crispy snack 
better than candy 
Lior Tahini All Natural 100% Pure Sesame 17.6 Oz (Pack of 4) 
Much better than their spicy ranchero sauce

Decent flavor for a quick fix 
It Tastes Like Spicy Catalina Dressing 
Not for me 
I'm From New Jersey what do I know about Chipotle? 
Not as good as the other Taco Bell sauces

Better than the Ranchero sauce 
Not spectacular but pretty good 
Just like the restaurant

Tastes Like Spicy Salad Dressing 
Yummy - Expires too Soon 
A nice dip 
very strong with a powdery taste 
Not bad not great just okay 
That's Some Spicy Sauce! 
Great tasting but way too fatty! 
Yum! (maybe) 
All right but not extraordinary 
Not craving it 
Fast Food salad dressing 
Heavy on Smoke and Vinegar 
Okay 
About what you'd expect.  S'okay. 
If you are hungering for some Taco Bell - this is the sauce for you! 
Well they got half of it right ... 
Tricky to meld with my summertime harvest 
Ehhh 
Kind of an interesting taste but nothing I crave 
Just spicy enough - not overwhelming 
Bold and Creamy Chipotle 
Very mild! 
Neither Bold Nor Spicy 
Pretty good but not sure what to do with it yet 
False advertising but tasty
