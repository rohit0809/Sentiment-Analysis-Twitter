Decent 
It works 
You get what you pay for

Basic mouse pad perfect for basic use. 
Great price but for a few dollars more you can get better quality.

Epson  2200 Review 
Not the End-all Be-all Solution 
Functional....but pricey 
Undersize 
Good product nice price 
Good once it's in.  Can be messy to install due to printer. 
Requires special headset 
Sturdy and does its job well but takes up quite a bit of space 
Good idea; perhaps not good value. Challenges in use but broader applications than billed. 
Seems poor for the price 
Expected better ... at the MSRP 
Just OK 
Overpriced and probably overkill for most uses 
Too large and the elastic string that holds the pages down is flimsy 
Functional If A Little Unwieldy and Cumbersome 
Nice but some major flaws

Five Sets of thin white dividers and invisible peelable strips for easy customizing. 
I really want to like it - but this stand falls short 
A useful stand for taking notes on what you're reading 
Well made but not for thick books. 
A flaw to consider before buying 
Adequate bookstand 
Not very strong 
Works ok... 
thin 
It smells 
Mouse pad 
It is a mouse pad. 
Works Great But Smells Bad 
Does what it's supposed to do. 
It's oil. It lubricates but... 
Just OK 
Its oil.  It works the way oil should. 
One caveat 
Does it's job but a bit messy 
Good Price Works Well but Poorly Designed Bottle that Leaks 
Hmmmmmm 
The product itself is okay but figuring out how to open the bottle was a little tricky 
This really is just vegetable oil 
Gets the job done - that's about all it does 
Okay 
Large tray 
Works. 
Cuts very well.  Rulers not precise 
Great Feel When Cutting! 
Will it last? 
Decent cheap trimmer. 
Not Always Even Cut. But it is a decent Device 
going back to my old trimmer 
I Prefer the Rolling Cutters 
Cuts well but not the one to get if you need accuracy 
Look at the photo not the specs 
really little 
Lightweight & efficient

Flap too flimsy and easily bent 
Flimsy Flap

It's okay if you don't intend to over-fill it or open the flimsy flap umpteen times a day! 
Functional but flap is disappointing 
These are average 
Good 
These Wilson Jones Insertablet 8 Tab Dividers are for lightweight organizing but the price is right! 
Decent tab dividers but not particularly durable ... 
Nothing special 
Perfectedly Ordinary Tab Dividers 
For Occasional Use 
They work but are flimsy and cheap. 
Cheap and imperfect but they do separate pages 
Pretty Standard 
Not much to say...it fills the bill 
Just the basics 
Fine for light use but not for everyday heavy use. 
Mixed results 
Plastic dividers are just not as good as paper. 
Great idea - damaged in production 
They seemed fine 
Not very comfortable to sit on for very long 
It's so hard to sit on! 
Not for fixed-height chairs

Not my favorite ink pen but does the job 
Consistency is \iffy\ 
okay 
I Was Hoping For a Better Quality! 
I Do Not Like Gel Pens 
The point section is a bit \tall\ for my hand 
My wife loves it. 
Much more comfortable grip but the clip is easily bent 
YOU have to mount this one for effective sharpening 
It's nice  but construction is pretty cheap 
Better than the Boston KS 
Underwhelmed 
Almost as good

a little flimsy 
not very sturdy 
Liked the organizational features but not as sturdy as I'd like... 
NICE COLORS GOOD QUALITY.

The cost is a bit much 
Clear packing tape works just as well 
Doesn't stick very well 
Tape is good price is bad.

The School Standard 
Good but look cheap 
Worked for a While 
Average but inexpensive 
OK but not really used very much

There are better options that can do 20 sheets with the same staples. 
It's okay 
A Staple 
Pretty cheap 
Depends on Much Stapling You Will Be Doing 
Nice to have for extra stapler!

They work 
Why not scored into quarters? 
Word presets work fine but having problems with clipart and images 
Stylish label for specific printing jobs but prone to smudges 
Very nice looking labels but tricky to use 
Adds a nice accent 
Labels don't work as well as expected; not for black-ink printers 
Disappointed 
Good tape does what it's supposed to bad dispenser 
It sure is super strength and they ain't fooling around! 
Super strong tape horrible dispenser! 
Think of it as heavy-duty office tape 
OK for medium duty work 
I wouldn't buy again 
OK BUT 
Interesting idea imperfect implementation

Decent binder loose plastic back 
Unimpressive 
Average binder 
Standard three ring binder with all the basic drawbacks.

Eco-friendly view binder is otherwise ordinary 
Standard Binder 
A Basic Round Ring Binder But The Covering Is Too Loose 
Expensive for a basic binder 
Should work well enough for me. 
Seriously? $9 for this? Not all that impressive. 
Does the job but needs some work. 
Almost made it through a semester... 
Basic 1 1/2 inch binder. 
Board Awesome Hangars and Accessories Not So Much 
I suggest 3 changes 
Decent 
Three Stars 
At least the tape stays where it should. 
OK ONLY... Dispenser 
It's okay but the At-A-Glance products are much better 
Good Style But A Little Off 
Large Thin paper. 
Better products exist but this looks nice 
Wide-Ruled? Is this business notes for third graders? 
Nice Page Layout --But Low Quality Paper 
Functionality depends on how you plan to use it and the type of writing instrument you use 
it's okay and pretty generic 
Well.... 
not worth the extra expense to me 
good product 
Pretty close to perfect but... 
Great printer but I don't understand the price. 
Great Idea Hard To Use! 
One big sticker gives lots of freedom to design but a little unwieldy to shape 
An Oaky Budget Option but Print Quality Suffers 
BEWARE - This is a \Compatible\ product 
As advertised 
OK Little Printer 
Compared to what? 
Good value. 
As expected but that clear. 
Ony 5 cartridges not 6 
It is EVERYDAY paper after all

Works but not great 
A Diamond Set in Cheap Plastic 
Washable eradicable blue ink. 
It did what it was supposed to. 
A Good Product but a Bad Idea. 
Will work more or less-depending on your phone 
Well-constructed but has limited usefulness 
For the right job it'll do... 
Fair But Not Quite What I'd Hoped For 
That Lack of Top Flap Is Not Actually A Good Thing... 
Not bad 
cardboard expanding file 
Ordinary stapler 
Not as Heavy Duty Given the Special Staples Needed 
Unfortunately they don't make them like they used to. 
Good but not what it used to be 
Well the binders are...ok....but empty-- and the alphabetical indexes provided only have the letter \W\ on them. 
Bought by mistake 
Does it's job but not very solid 
Good while it lasted 
Fast quiet but very small and shallow cup 
No frills sturdy sharpener for the deep pocketed and two-armed.

The picture does not do it \justice\ 
Special purpose tape 
Not as good as I had hoped 
decent refill 
Fine for the price but not for high-quality technical drawing 
Small but useful 
Nothing to write home about 
Mine arrived dried out

Store them point down 
Great for the Kids not for Work 
Fair... the smaller the board the better! 
They're perfect for kids hands but not mine 
Nice markers erasers fall off 
Mixed bag! 
A decent set of markers 
Bright Colors but Not Well Made 
Convenient but... 
Everything you ever need wrapped up into one pen.  It's about time!! 
Good for the price; hang upside down to avoid drying out 
Very bright not always easy to erase 
I have bought 6 packages all with different ratings 
Would Like a Finer Point 
Magnets work fine but markers need to be pushed hard 
nice colors but lacking quality 
Clever idea - but lacked to execute 
Okay but not great 
Reasonably handy but thin line and magnets are not very strong. 
Not as opaque as expected 
Bought Once to Try 
Pens worked but  magnets failed 
Magnetic dry-erase markers - poor quality 
Small but Useful 
Unsure about these 
3.5* - Erasers are flimsy 
I wish someone would do this right /  2nd one failed now 
Fine for sending garbage for getting. 
\Carbon Paper\ results becaue it uses \carbon paper\. 
Not for academic use. 
sturdy to feel at hand 
Nice markers poor color matching 
Great palette but could last longer 
Shades a little surprising but a good set of several colors 
Double duty clamshell! 
many color way too light to write with 
Great printer with a few big flaws.

Stand Out 
Not what I had hoped for 
Custom fit - not adjustable 
I really like it but I'm not sure I'd recommend it (strange eh?) 
It's Okay...claims to extend the mouse life. 
Effective but pricey 
Lots of nice features but not the most comfortable 
The primary value is in the rigid mouse pad and wrist pad surface 
works well but pricey 
For the price not exactly wonderful 
Not for me 
comfortable but not remarkable 
Far too limited for the price. 
Just okay--Repurposed 
Too expensive for what it does 
Adjustable - Once 
Does what it can do just not a full solution to my bad posture and achy hands 
Gel wrist guard is great but the platform has limited and fixed permanent choices for  calling it \adjustable \ 
Does what you expect 
Works well but runs out FAST 
As advertised but only purchase if you absolutely have to 
A mistake 
Canon printer always had stripes in solid areas. 
Always buying ink 
Problem with Borders 
Inconsisently says \out of paper\ and is an ink hog but good quality 
Minimally effective - does the job but has drawbacks 
Doesn't do all I needed 
Beautiful scans but weak flimsy plastic breaks too easily 
Just O.K. product. 
Good for the money 
Not As Expected. 
Would Not Buy Again 
Not especially practical.

Hit or miss 
Decent binder improvements needed in shipping

I want to give it 5 stars... but I can't! 
Quality Has Gone Down 
Always Need Ink 
OK scale for what I paid but there is a problem. 
Ok but make sure you purchase the right thickness for your floor type 
Great pencil but with weaker design than GG 500 
Not bad but the 500 is half the price 
Good if you're looking for cheap box to storage your documents to have them one place and avoid mess... 
Damaged 
Not meant for heavier items. 
Worth the price 
hard to assemble 
Average 
Too Small! 
Meh.. 
Not exactly happy with these

Not a true 6\ wide 
Smaller than you think 
Kind of thin but the price is great. 
Nice great price fast shipping but they seem to tear more easily than I am comfortable with. 
by the 68 if your printer supports it 
Axis far behind handle puts significant strain on user's arm 
sharpie doesn't let you down... 
Some good some bad. 
Narrow tip some too dark and I couldn't prove Smear Guard 
Sharpie makes better permanent markers 
Needs improvement 
A little too dark for highlighters

it's just string 
Decent Clips Short Nails 
A-OK at a good price. 
Beware the starter cartridge. ($100 scanner + $80 cartridge). 
There is better paper out there 
Shipping Warning 
Fine but clearly not the best choice 
Works but Awkward 
Requires Special Staples 
Comparison with Scotch \Premium\ 
Weak Adhesive: Does Not Stick Well 
Wish The Rools Were Larger 
just okay-not great 
They DO bleed to the other side of your paper! 
Fun but Limited 
Great value and beautiful colors but... 
see through 
Swingline Optime PowerEase - good 
Expected more 
Alas falls short of perfect 
Expansion is a bit clumsy 
Requires the right kind of paper 
Pencils but Not Painting Tools 
Great pencil but average as a painting pencil 
Too light on color intensity 
nice pencils but not so much for watercolors 
Purchased in February getting worried by issues in  July... 
Make sure your laptop display can open very wide

No better than the Dollar Tree cheapies 
Erases well but questioning durability 
Takes some elbow grease 
A Good 3M Product 
No water required 
Effective sponge type eraser for whiteboards 
Just OK - doesn't completely remove all ink marks 
NOT so effective sadly 
Doesn't Seem to Work as Advertised 
Sponge eraser it works and it's easily cleaned

Where Will You Use It? 
Hoping for much more... 
Buy Mr. Clean Magic Eraser and Save Some Money 
Okay? Sure. Necessary? No. 
Add Water For Dry-Erase? 
it's okay. 
Erases Well 
Maybe not magic... 
works as advertised but could have been better 
As good as the alternatives 
Good Product. 
A little flimsy 
Pros and cons 
Do you really need this... or will it be another unused gadget? 
Need to have Heat Control 
Disappointing 
Good for cutting in or outlining 
Lots of problems 
Check dimensions first 
Used daily however angle slider adjustment gets in way of pushing under desk 
Works pretty good 
Not for large paws 
Fairly low rent ploddingly effective 
Nifty and colorful... but is at what cost? 
Just okay 
OK but be prepared to assemble 
Very specific uses. 
Nothing great....

Won't Stay In Place 
Cheaper than at the store

Great for erasing thinner lines 
It's ink!

Ink runs out too fast 
Change the *10^n key to an EE key and you've got yourself a winner! 
Fails in comparison to other scientific non-graphing calculators 
Hated this calculator at first but then found some of its strong points 
Great value for the amount you get 
Works great for shipping smaller things

Good but very expensive 
Works well for what I needed 
Not The Best It Does Work... A little... 
Works but requires a good amount of elbow grease 
Good Points and Bad Points

Good Product But Expensive 
Quality Prints -- Poor Software 
Great home / home office laser printer

Has its Pros and Cons 
Good deal on a fair printer 
Not terrible. 
They're Just Ok 
Not good enough for me 
Disappointing 
Useful but a little overpriced

A very solid product: revised after 2 weeks use 
Good quality but surface a little too small 
Better than average

Doesn't really help with my carpel tunnel & tendonitis 
A little too thick 
Has pro's and con's based on your preferences.... 
All-in-one solution for the keyboard and the mouse. 
Too Large & Intrusive  for Most Keyboards 
Not too supple 
Good but not as soft as I expected... 
Consider the Shape 
Straight rest for the wrist 
Does not work with optical/laser mouse 
Not bad 
Removes large staples. 
Works well on removing heavy duty staples - wouldn't buy again...too bulky 
iffy for thinner paper 
Not the Best 
Easy to use with drawbacks 
Jelly Roll Pens - Ink Come out too fast doesn't last 
only slightly better than regulat Scotch tape. 
Good markers

I Like the Cheerful Pastel Colors But Folders Could Be Bigger 
DISAPPOINTED 
Good Solid Folder Except for Tab 
Lighter weight file in pleasant colors 
haiku plus review

Useful but the main feature isn't a feature 
Good but not special 
Keeping Tabs 
here are the specs 
ONLY IF YOU PLAN TO WRAP THINGS ALL DAY LONG 
It can be improved 
Difficult tradeoff between convenience and cost 
not sure 
Can't See This Replacing My Full-Size Tape Dispenser 
Works well for gift-wrapping but tape refills are too expensive 
Cute But Ultimately Pointless Gadget 
Neat new gadget 
It's okay. 
Very handy but refills are expensive 
Handy but limitation 
Works but is it worth it? 
Good for lots of taping but not worth it for occasional use 
Kids Like It - Too Much 
Convenient 50% of the time inconvenient the other 50%! 
3.5 Stars -- Some pros and cons 
Very handy dispenser - no pun intended 
Good concept poor execution 
Tape helper good but is this really needed? 
Interesting concept but I prefer regular tape rolls 
tape with handband 
Could be better 
Good idea quickly gets used up 
Easy to use.  A bit hard to load refills. 
Scotch PopUp Handband Tape Dispenser - A Great Time-Saving Tool 
Nice idea but not worth it if you have dispenser 
What to get the person who has everything 
I like it but... 
runs out quickly 
I could have used this handy dispenser years ago 
Not very cost effective 
Works great but just not necessary 
Good but... 
Great idea 
Why? 
Makes Life Easier for the Wrapping Impaired 
so-so 
Smooth sailing it is not. 
Sturdy 
Crooked Scans - Straight Results 
Got it 
It's OK could be better but is fine for casual use. Fair value. 
Mousepad w/ Gel Wrist Pad 
Love mousing surface-hate vinyl covered wrist rest 
Best mousepad yet until it curled up 
So-so mouse pad 
Not Intended for the Large Handed 
The edges curl up 
Nice - But I Wish It Were Larger 
Seems like a nice item but not for me 
Comfortable and modern-looking. Good for today's office decor. 
just a couple flaws on this sturdy mouse pad/wrist rest combo 
too small to be useful 
Good but not Great 
Loved the idea but pens went dry fast... 
A good quality product at a reasonable price

A great idea! 
OK Envelopes For General Use 
good envelope 
Okay if you have multiple pages inside. 
No different from other legal size envelopes 
Solid Envelopes 
security envelopes 
High quality envelopes but they do not seal 'flat'

Nice envelopes but security feature doesn't work 
Functional but not as convenient as other Press & Seal styles 
Seem to do the job 
Ok Envelopes 
Average envelopes 
Good concept the execution less so 
OK but not really tamper evident. 
Average but serviceable envelopes 
Nothing spectacular here but not bad either 
These envelopes stay glued better than most pre-glued envelopes 
Minimal privacy protection but sturdy. 
NOT QUITE AS ADVERTISED 
Not Really That Different 
Okay Not Great 
Good product but.. 
Mailings 
They're okay but not the most secure. 
NIFTY BUT FLAWED 
Lightweight privacy envelopes 
Secure Envelops 
Not really as described - they are ok envelopes - not tamper-revealing. 
Why pay extra for mediocrity 
Good for standard use but not for security 
Still doesn't beat the envelopes where users pull a strip to expose the adhesive... 
fine 
Nothing special 
LIke the Seal but This Envelope Still Reveals the Contents When Sealed 
An Ok Envelope Nothing Special 
Pushing the Envelope 
Where's The \Red\? 
OK Envelopes But There are Better Options 
Good standard envelop 
Really thin 
I prefer a different peel and seal type 
Nice envelopes that you don't have to lick 
Fine for luggage etc. but wheels too small. 
the cards are fine but the price leads to ingenious alternative solutions 
Thinnner 
Thin and expensive but they \work\ 
Somewhat overpriced but decent index cards 
Average Product 
Good if you don't need to handle the card often 
Thin... 
These would work for school research projects

Oh So Thin...Index Cards on a Diet!

Ok but could be better 
I've been setting up the printer for four hours now... 
good for an inexpensive laser 
Good buy but noisy 
Broken Network Card 
Good Printer Impossible to Set-Up Wireless Connection 
The older Parkers were so much better 
Not a gift pen 
Basic but works 
A solution in search of a problem 
Sturdy Plastic Sheath 
NOT Archival-Safe or Acid-Free 
Interesting variation on display tech 
Useful Depending on What You Have Planned 
Nice but the use is somewhat limited 
Functional But Overpriced 
Nice to display 'fridge art' 
It works 
Looks cheap but good for childs room wall. 
Stanley Home Design Magnetic Door Stop 
JUST OK 
Can't get glue adhesive off 
Dry 
Weak magnets modifications required 
Quartet Dry Erase Board (8.5 x 11) 
Has A Problem Staying Put.. 
Weak Magnetic Backing 
Not durable but does the job 
Weak Mounting Magnets Otherwise Ok 
Nothing Special About This Dry-Erase Board 
weak magnets will not hold board up 
Good bookends do the job nothing extraordinary 
too small & light to be of much use 
Buy Cheap Get Cheap 
Range is good but long time battery life stinks 
AT&T Not What It Used To Be 
DECT 6.0 not as interference free as they claim 
Very good but many drawbacks! 
It works but........... 
Mixed feelings... 
Takes some getting used to 
SCRAPED PAINT 
Significant issue makes it only 3 star worthy 
A lot for the money 
Not so sure after using for a while 
weird; super thin and not very sticky 
Nice - but could be better 
It's too small for my taste 
Warm and Bright 
Sticky Situation 
Laminate good times come on! (It's a lamination....) 
Fine for Certain Things 
Convenient but Too Thin. Inadequate Protection for Small Items Such As ID Cards. 
Works ok 
Easy to use but so-so presentation quality 
Not commercial grade product .... 
Plastic.  No tools assembly.  Good not great 
There's a reason this is less than $40 
Bought it for my classroom 
There must be a better way... 
strong chemical odor upon arrival.... 
Expected more from 3M 
Wish it was a bit softer. 
It's okay but... 
Firm Foam wrist rest...gel is better 
Sometimes bigger really is better 
If there is a difference I have yet to discover it 
Could stand to be wider 
Stick with gel 
Supportive But Some Downsides 
Great resting...horrible chemical scent 
A bit disappointed 
Battery consumption is an issue! 
A Good American-Made Binder But Expensive 
It works it's overpriced 
Price is a barrier. 
Hey...it's a binder and an expensive one at that. 
Too expensive for the lacking quality 
It's really nice but there are better options for much less money 
Misleading Information 
Liked the Big Tab not the folder 
Average product 
Very lightweight folders with a twist 
SuperTab? Not really. 
Helpful if you are using only these folders 
They're file folders nothing remarkable

Art Chalk 
Vibrant Colors Expensive Chalk 
Eleven Dollars for a Box of Chalk!!! 
Not as vibrant as hoped 
Nice Ink but Not the Color I Had Expected 
Expensive but does what it says 
Just another sharpener 
Loved it at first then it tanked 
New One: Still works great at 6mths - Old One: After a while only sharpened one side of pencil 
its ok just expensive 
Use a lot of photo paper.. 
A heavy-duty product I think best for office situations 
Very heavy duty some effort to install but works OK. 
You need to be handy! 
ink 
it's not as good as expected 
Works but somewhat flimsy 
Functional especially for smaller hands 
Good writing Pen but...... 
Very comfy but sometimes falls apart 
for very tall people who weigh less than 250 lb 
Easy Assembly. AMAZON SELLS FOR $79 
Just okay 
Some fit and finish issues 
Not much RAM really slow speeds 
Looks great sounds great feels great BUT... 
Feature Stuffing! 
Great potential cut short by annoying flaws and design shortcomings. 
Pins are abit on the small side and the pink is not very vibrant 
Okay Printer Scanner Copier with not so good Fax and Sofware and Horrible Technical Support 
200 pages indeed! 
Better buy a few 
Good Bang for your $ ... But Misleading Rating... 
Good Price

Not The Longest Lasting Ink 
It's Ink 
Decent Results...Small Cartridge... 
Not The Longest Lasting Ink 
Decent printer.... 
An improvement but still some very irritating features. 
Not very comfortable 
Too Small 
Pretty and functional but not very comfortable. 
Cute but the gel-filled wrist rest is actually useless 
Mouse pad with gel wrist rest 
Should Be Bigger 
Going back to Liquid Paper DryLine Grip! ! 
Like mousing on sandpaper 
Works but can only be used once

Not quite what I expected... 
They're pens... 
Did Not Like!

Should be black 
Wish I could say it was a better printer 
BIG! 
Great concept but a little awkward 
Not Sure What I'll Use This For 
Lots of good features but not as expandable as it could/should be 
Has Its Uses But Not A Universal Storage And Organization Solution 
Nothing against this product but the price 
Good for backpacks but not for clipboards. 
Love the idea 
Good for keeping things contained 
Room for improvement 
3 1/2 Stars - Great Cork Portion But Some Construction Issues 
Board does not allow versatility in positioning. 
I would get it again but have some reservations 
Overpriced but decent. 
Excellent calculator poor construction 
Meh... okay based only on quantity of ink it will hold 
Wishing for better quality pen refills 
these dry up very quickly 
so so 
Neat but not one-size-fits-all 
Super Printer? 
Poor Horizontal Line Quality in Faster Modes 
Works with Linux but... 
Chalk Holder 
An \old-fashioned\ black ink; not for checks 
Works really well on the right size document 
ACLU card yes bowling ball no 
honestly 
It's a pen 
Nicely Made Sleeves 
They're all right... 
Good product but expensive 
Spring broke after very few uses. 
Paper Mate White Pearl Premium Erasers 
Writes smoothly but needs to be darker 
Washable blue ink 
Not as good as Pilot G2 but a nice pen nonetheless 
Not nearly as impressed as others here. 
Slow 
Okay 
Unit cost too high 
Little Use Laminator 
only for large pieces of paper. 
It's alright but with a few quirks 
5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = a halo-effect 3-star average 
Not easy to use as heated one 
Lightweight and easy to grasp but imperfect to use 
Not What the Pro's Use 
Only get this if you don't tape very often 
OK for home use 
Nice feel but some issues 
Lives up to it's name but... 
decent tape dispenser 
Cost is an issue 
ok for sealing boxes but I've used better 
Some nice details but still prefer the large tape guns. 
Good for homeowner use not for lots of shipping 
Handy & Attractive Dispenser 
No better than the standard dispenser 
Bic is a great brand 
Lead breaks too easily 
No Difference 
Responds to light touch. Not sure it's designed for daily or heavy-duty use; can't open to use on flat surfaces. 
Good not great 
Utilitarian folder for big projects 
Wonderful Idea but Overpriced for Card stock 
Great organizer for 8.5\ x 11\ (or even smaller) papers 
Functional but not great 
Ideal for small or light-weight packaging. 
Fair Product 
Compared to my Fujitsu Ill stick with the Fujitsu 
Not as impressive as I thought it would be... 
Great hardware and software combination at a very premium price 
Some installation problems but works but very expensive. 
Hardware is nearly there but software falls a bit short 
Mediocre Scanner 
How cool is this?!!!  [WAIT read to the end for not-so-cool bits.] 
OK but not the simple solution I'd hoped for 
Not for everyday folks but some business users will like 
A great idea but really slow 
can not be used outside of the program but scans okay. 
OK for archiving not so much for bookkeeping 
Seems Like a Good Idea - but Not Practical 
For the business traveler 
Just OK 
[Updated] It was \Neat compact efficient and handy\ but... 
If you buy it do it for the software! 
needed it 
order frequentlydon't print that much 
Maybe it's my printer but... 
expensive for everyday printing 
Good ink small amount

Works but don't like the feet 
It's a plastic monitor platform... 
It Works For Special Situations 
Fellowes Monitor Riser 
Works fine but flimsy looking for the price

Wish the cover was sturdier 
Can be a good office notebook 
Nice But Feels A Little Off 
Good and bad features 
A different kind of notebook 
Good for Using at Lectures 
Great concept; too much wasted space. 
A problem if you have lots of sheets to protect 
ok 
ok 
Marred surfaces 
Not very good very low quality desk accessory 
Why so separate? 
It's Ink...Blue...And Liquid At Room Temperature 
When you own an inkjet printer you have bought into price gouging by manufacturers for the printer ink. 
Almost perfect 
A gift 
Ink comes off from printing when touched 
Does the job but expensive 
As advertised 
Dry erase Board and Marker only ... no eraser 
Who is giving all these high reviews? 
... the nib is not as smooth as I would like for it to be 
Good not great... 
I WOULD OF RATHER SPEND A BIT MORE MONEY AND HAVE NO LEAKAGE!! DISAPPOINTED 
A Basic Phone with a Cheap Headset 
Works well but a really a bit out of date already. 
Good 
Some nice features but not enough 
Low Smell is nice but doesn't last as long either 
Ink looks like watered down paint 
Average 
all right 
Possibilities limitless but wastes labels and quality moderate 
Bad installation - good label printing 
Good enough for text-only labels 
It's nice but not needed by most... 
Very Slick Little Item 
Good decent phone overall.  Battery life not so great. 
Only fairly sticky 
Useful but VERY BASIC device for learning some common phrases. 
Great Idea but Could be Better... 
Functions fine but actual field test is only way to know.. 
It's Ok But Fragile 
Maybe I received a bum unit? 
Read the instructions AND practice (save phrases) BEFORE you need it ... 
Nifty Idea But Falls Short 
Needs improvement! A book is faster! 
Pleasing Translator Best Used As A Learning Toy. 
Good for the price and in a pinch... 
Seems to be for a very specific kind of traveler - and it's not me 
+ 1/2 star: good but not the best 
moderate-stick labels with a green bent 
as good as but not better than normal file folders 
Some nice features but too thin 
Easier to read labels easier to differentiate files COSTLY 
Love the colors... 
Gets the job done but doesn't inspire confidence 
It does its job 
A good functional sharpener 
Average Electric Pencil Sharpener 
Not as good as my Bostitch 
A decent sharpener 
our least favorite sharpener 
It's like sticking a  4 cylinder engine in a big old Caddy 
Not bad Low Use Sharpener 
Doesn't suit my needs - but may work well for you 
Just okay 
Lots of Colors~ 
Uncomfortable. 
Average quality chair | Still better than what you'd find at an office supply store 
Needs more magnet strength. 
Writing surface holds smudges 
Cute but needs stronger magnets 
Great for a cheapie whiteboard 
Yes it's okay.... 
Magnets are weak but board works great 
It's OK 
OK 
OK 
Beware HP Ink Claims/Messages 
Not what I had expected... 
Not as good as the bullet pen and feels kind of cheap 
Is not easy to write cleanly with this pen 
Cheap price cheap product. 
Works slightly better than traditional labels 
Useful but not essential 
Apply to clean flat paper surfaces only 
Very good phone system 
Generic brand labels differ depending on who you buy from. 
withholding final judgement 
Great printer (for a while) support not so great 
Avoid 8500 if you use Quicken 
Uses more ink than HP claims! 
adequate but unexciting 
The majority of the cost is due to the wireless - make sure you need it. 
Wireless Stopped Working 
Swingline Optima Handles the Big Stapling Jobs Most of the Time 
A little too complex for its capability 
It works but it's big heavy and expensive. 
Easily removed yet still stick good again and again 
Use this as a place to keep my gift cards 
It works. Not as well as my thirty-year-old sharpener but it works. 
HUGE loud and time consuming 
Had high hopes... 
Not your ordinary pen. 
Works well for temporarily holding things 
Works Well Only To A Point...Don't Reposition Too Many Times. 
It works 
A Fair Label but not realiable 
Impressive pencil sharpener but there are better ones out there for less money 
good sharpener 
awesome! except when a pencil gets stuck then it is useless 
Interesting Sharpener 
Works just fine a little louder than our current sharpener 
Can only recommend with great caution 
Task chair for normal folks a regular chair for us of greater stature

Sturdy Chair Poor Manufacturing 
Great Product 
Great printing low ink consumption but not reliable 
It's like a fidgety kid it may be demon possessed 
Good product but overpriced. 
Good quality filing tabs...Get it if you like florescent colors 
Not As Good As Another Named Brand Of Filing Tabs 
Tabs are somewhat see-through 
Reusable 
nice but not enough in package 
For Hanging Folders 
Useful within another file 
Dull colors made visual organization harder 
Thin cheap feeling cardboard folders 
Disappointed 
A clever idea however.... 
SLOOOWWWWW for home use only 
good personal use printer but not really good as an \office\ AIO 
Great machine for the money 
Mixed Feelings 
Freezer tape vs. labels 
Just OK 
It's been about 6 months

Great generic battery for price 
missing slot for headset 
Worst customer service 
Didn't connect

It's actually a good phone but... 
Extra Phone 
Lasted 5 months 
A little flimsy 
Standard security envelopes. Could be better

Very good if you need ledger printing. Not so good if you don't. 
Not too sticky.

Brother Toner... as good as the printer it goes in 
Decent dictionary not so good sound quality 
Handy little gadget! 
Handy but lacks documentation for all the features jammed into this device 
Workso Prettyo Goodo! 
Could be helpful in a pinch - but not as straightforward and simple to use as I'd like 
Good But could be a bit better. 
Good Dictionary - Good Sound - Bad Instructions 
Good printer with some deal breakers 
Not very easy to assemble but the boxes protect 
The standard bearer 
Kind of cheap quality for the price 
It's okay but nothing more 
Just right size 
Decent board good size but the pen is bad and it left the factory damaged 
Basic board. A bit too expensive. No mounting hardware. 
Functional 
Decent cleaner and eraser pens very nice narrow lines but ink hard to clean 
Not so great. Good color but lots of smears. 
Doesn't Work Like I'd Hoped 
No Problem with Writing or Erasing 
D 
Just Okay 
It looks cool but doesn't work as expected. 3.5 stars 
don't need one 
Pictures can be bit misleading 
Hard sell 
A bit uncomfortable...not seeing the need.... 
Doesn't act like a pencil and takes some getting used to... 
An ok mech. pencil but I'm happy with the cheap ones 
great pencil 
Really tough lead is that enough? 
Innovative but falls a bit short 
uni-ball Pencil 
Spongy and imprecise 
eh hype 
Neat idea but not for me 
Good but a little wobbly 
It's okay. 
Works well as a pencil but...... 
Not quite 
Good but needs improvement. 
Kuru Toga Mechanical Pencil Review 
Worst Epson I've owned 
Not a Great deal but Better than retail 
Bought this for a rather junky inkjet printer... 
Solid printer unreasonably expensive ink 
Compatible to the Brother cartridges but the colors were not true 
They do the job 
It will crack and fall apart in 6 months 
nice colors but 
a decent sharpener 
Did the job but not as strong as other boxes 
okay for most uses 
Good for Moving or Storage 
Average strength great design 
Storage boxes you may need 
Pricey But Useful Boxes 
Boxes are solid but questionable reusability 
A Good Moving Box But A Little Pricey 
Not really what I thought they were... 
Nice printer.  Frustrating and buggy software. 
Great product BUT 
Hook 'n Go 
Only recommended if you want to latch a notebook to a binder. 
A little expensive for the quality... 
Can be useful but some features are lacking 
a good idea 
Not necessarily suited for special needs kids... 
good tool for beginning penmanship 
Nothing amazing here 
My son couldn't get into this one. 
Interesting product but mixed on helpfulness 
Unnecessary 
Constrains beginning writers 
Fine product but over priced 
Good quality paper but one problem 
It works & it's the loudest home shredder ever.... 
works okay 
Nice Phone But No Live Person In Service To Help Me 
A bit watery don't love the color 
Too over-built and heavy although sturdy 
2nd attemp to write a review 
Disappointing 
Useful product small packet 
Useful Little Index Tabs Another Good Idea from Post-Its 
Needs Documentation 
Good pointer presenter but... 
Nice little product but $75 seems a little high 
Take 3 gadgets strip functionality and mold them into 1 piece. 
Good but way overpriced 
Handy laser pointer controller and USB storage for your Powerpoint presentations 
A bit pricey 
Comfortable to hold but a tad expensive and not very bright 
Where's the On Button? 
Good: Simple elegant ergonomic....Bad: Price 
Price point here is the death knell .. 
No Wow Factor Here 
Lexmark Wireless 3-in-1 Printer - updated 
Way overpriced sticky notes 
Neat idea and cute but still searching for practical applications 
Nothing Special - Won't Stick to Every Material Type 
Different from Post-It notes and mostly in good ways. 
Weak adhesive and average durability. 
Great product but way overpriced! 
Great little labels 
Easy to remove but doesn't always stay in place 
Not sticky enough 
Time will tell 
Temporary Not \Removable\ 
These are okay but not much to get excited about 
An Average Product 
Removable Label Pads 
Great idea but edges curl too much to be practical 
Truly Temporary! This limits the applications. 
They are labels and have color! 
Strong !! 
Work as stated but nothing special 
A label that is easy to remove 
Decent labels but not as sticky as I would want it 
Avery Label Pad is just like a post-it note pad 
It's no Post-It 
Better for removeable than reusable 
Good labels for Typing 
OK label but not a great Avery product 
Not sure what they're thinking but.... 
Nice quality paper - too small 
Self adhesive labels that's all. 
Decent shipping labels but could be better 
Small Labels 
A Little Pricey for a Basic Label Not Sure How Useful They'd Be for Most 
Permanent Labels for Hand Writing Only 
Perfectly acceptable item that could have more value for others than it did for me. 
Ok 
let me try to help everyone having trouble 
Printing Around The Edges 
I'm skeptical of all toners... 
Nice but not for serious photographer

A printer with many caveats... 
Wireless 2.4GHz Windows Keyboard with Trackball 
Not sure I like the thick hooks 
Ok but very bulky desktop unit. 
they work 
A good value 
After reading the reviews on this guy I had my doubts 
Stainless steel finish plastic :) 
Looks good but magnets are not strong enough 
Nice design with minor issues 
Pretty but weak magnets greatly lessen its value 
Just okay... 
Insufficient Magnets Make This Difficult To Use 
Functions well but looks very cheap 
Has some important limitations 
mounting magnets too weak otherwise ok 
an okay idea not well-executed 
Great for students and teachers 
Think it's leaving a residue 
Not too bad 
Easy to use but expensive 
Didn't realize this required a subscription 
A Nice Starter Package 
A Lot of Fine Print But It's Nice If You Need Lots of Postage. 
I like Stamps.Com...this is one way to get started. 
Not as Great as the White Label But Still Good 
Nice to clean up a box but not good for printing an address on 
Great for improving the look of a box but don't print postage etc. on them 
interesting but not sure about useful 
Works Great 
great labels but white are much easier to see and cheaper 
Good for reusing boxes; not great for address labels 
Great labels but worth the price? 
not intuitive at all 
why is it so big? 
Do the job 
Sometimes ok sometimes great 
Excellent adhesive.  Thin stock. 
Has some problems..... 
Might Be A Little Excessive 
3M Labels Are Fine But Instruction For Using The Templates Are Lacking 
Easy-remove 
See through! 
Holiday Mailing 
LABEL PADS 
Doesn't work on plastic totes! 
Full label is sticky but not super sticky 
These are so-so 
Basically A Post-In Note With Adhesive Across The Whole Thing 
not that different from regular post-its 
Good idea maybe needs a little tweaking ... 
Not lovin' them as much as I did at first.... 
Good but not great 
Good 
pricey 
Works well but has limited uses 
Sticky-back tags 
Great Idea Not a Great Product 
Good but quirky pricey.  Post-It Color Coding labels better option?... 
Mable Mable if you're able get a color coding label 
Bold 
Great product not sure why it's called \Super Sticky\ 
They certainly are bright! 
Not for use as postal mailing labels but good for organizing 
Great for easy identification 
Decent 
Love them - but paper width/thickness may pose problem for some printers 
Neat Idea 
Kinda so-so 
Not good for plastic bins 
3M Lables Are Fine But Lack instruction For Using Printing Template 
Compatible with Avery Standard labels 
Rather ordinary 
Does what it says! 
Not quite aligning right 
A bit thin and see-through 
Average labels -- not so thick 
only draw back is size 
Too small... 
A Nice Product But... 
Not great. 
A probably dying need done moderately well 
Meets my needs...slightly better than average performance 
What's So Great About Labels? 
Two lines only 
Sticky and small 
2000 teeny tiny labels 
They are ok but 
I prefer larger labels 
Return Address Labels 
not perfect 
3M Labels Are Fine But Instruction For Using The Templates Are Lacking 
Removable Adhesive File Folder Labels 
Temporary solution for filing needs 
Great way to reorganize your filing system but smudge with laser printing (inkjet fine) 
I'll probably stick with Avery (har har) 
We put these through a variety of tests - they work great for us but design flaw may cause printer jamming 
Pretty good product 
Stick Well but not the Brightest: Check Prices of Competitors 
Thin and see through... 
Holds back interior doors fine but isn't hard enough- difficult to put in place with just your foot 
Lots of options 
complicated 
2 year assessment (purchased this day 2 years ago) 
Not bad at all but not a great thing too 
Best Black ink for the Lexmark Pro901 printer 
Neat product but... 
Good for specialty labeling needs 
Questionable longevity 
Useful but Templates are PEST! 
Serviceable 
Slightly stickier than a Post-It made for a printer 
Not To Bad But Could Be A Bit Better 
Make Garage Sales Much Less Work 
Nice idea 
A Change of Opinion 8 Months Later. Originally a Beautiful High Resolution Photographics Eats Ink But a Great Step Up 
Slightly disappointed 
Good for Home Use 
Don't expect a perfect binding on your first try 
Useful and works okay 
OK for small quick jobs that don't have to look professional 
Good for at home use 
Good product for the design 
Love them - but we love Post-Its more 
good for a specific use 
Tab It: An Avery NoteTabs Review 
These are good but almost too thick 
A Bit Fuzzy but Otherwise an Okay Buy 
Good for some not for others 
They do what they should... and a bit more 
Seem Expensive For What They Are 
Nice product but flawed 
Depends on what you want them for. 
AVERY Note Tabs---Not Bad 
expensive for 20 numbered tabs 
handy 'pocket' for specialized use 
Convenient but too lightweight 
Not reliable or terribly useful 
Nice product but limited usefulness 
I wanted to like these... 
Handy for putting CDs in bound material 
Average at Best 
Innovative but not all that functional 
Avery CD Size PocketTabs- Great Idea but needs stronger adhesive! 
Okay nothing fabulous 
Easy to use 
Good basic label printer for price. 
Clunky and pricey but what is the alternative 
it is ok 
Good Scissors for learning to cut 
Germ free? But look dirty. 
not as good quality as a Fiskar or other brands like Scotch 
Pretty Sharp 
Great start: needs improvement! 
Great for very short-term but \become permanent with time\ 
Tab It: An Avery NoteTabs Review 
neat 
3 inches is too long for my purposes 
I don't quite get these! 
A Good *Idea* But Falls Short... 
good organizational tool 
Green notes 
Neat features but utility is questionable 
Weird size otherwise OK 
Don't care for the huge adhesive footprint of these tabs 
You get what you pay for for good and for bad 
Useful for those who frequently review hard copy content 
Good for the hyper-organized 
Best for thick-sheeted scrapbooks 
Terrific item for a limited set of users I think 
They are good for some 
Best for college students imho. 
Very nice product 
Good for organizing but could be better 
Avery NoteTabs (16336) 
Neat Item but Not Versatile 
ON THE FENCE 
Great idea for some applications 
Nice idea great functionality  might be trying to do too much 
Good for heavy duty books not for everything 
Good product but could be better. 
Good for the organized 
Helpful but other options might work better 
Useful but only for those who have a need 
Good but limited uses 
not very useful 
There are better alternatives 
Nice idea but... 
Does what it claims 
Seemed like a great idea at the time 
High Quality Product For a Unique Need 
does what it does at a steep price 
Nice but EXPENSIVE! 
Another fine product from Avery! 
Great but expensive! 
Labels work well way overpriced 
Great professional looking labels but may be cost ineffective 
Not cost effective 
Works Great Speeds Up Workflow but Quite Expensive 
Great quality labels at a high cost 
Nice Unit on second one.New Problems 
Very cute but not a workhorse 
Pretty But Cheap 
Nice color hard to use 
Lightweight multi-pocket filer tote with clasp and handle 
Decent carrier but I don't expect it to last too long 
sturdy 
Durable and lighweight 
Cheap 
Not Durable 
pretty small for us 
Mini Organizer 
Functions well 
Does the job but not customizable 
Great when it works 
EDITED: not so perfect hand-sized stapler for those with hand strength issues 
brand new and already sticks a bit 
Good stapler 
Not bad for light use but it has limitations 
An ok stapler 
It's okay. 
Good for home use 
Cheap ink wifi but..... 
Only OK - lack of dedicated photo tray and color ink requirement disappointing 
My Celebrity Apprentice printer is finally here! 
It's just OK but check out other printer before buying 
Adequate Performance no Fax function 
Glossy Kodak ESP 5250 Wi-Fi 
OK printer with a few shortcomings. 
Decent but not great... 
Prior model is better - Missing document feeder renders fax virtually useless - Touchsmart Web is a gimmic 
Nice Printer 
UPDATED REVIEW- BROKE FAST...Not perfection but fixed fast 
Solid easy to grip reinforced side gussets but too expensive 
Standard Issue + Plus 
A nice idea but needs to be more secure 
Fine for what I use it for 
Too flimsy for travel 
Flimsy 
Nice Idea but Too Pricey for the Quality 
Pricey but Works Well 
Not durable enough given the price 
Nice Idea but Flimsy 
Would Have Been Perfect If It had a Closure for the Larger Section 
Lightweight and handy but less effective than a sturdy binder 
Decent chair 
Decent but nothing special 
Post office mix up...item received 
Handy and doesn't sag 
nice little organizational tool 
3.5 Stars 
Not Revolutionary 
Ended up returning it but may be good under certain conditions 
It Works 
Steep initial cost unusable caller id in basic plan 
Flimsy but it's okay 
Lock is kind of tricky. 
Doesn't last long at all 
Great printer...setup not so great 
Gives You Great Color Prints at an Affordable Price! 
Great all in one for the office! 
A reasonable choice unless you require duplex 
some good some not 
Good ink for a Lexmark Pro901 
Good for Small Projects 
For Impressing Clients 
Pendaflex Organize Project Management System 
It's a Presentation Portfolio 
Well made organizer 
$30?  Really?!?! 
Sturdy and Expandable to a Certain Extent 
Seemed overly complicated 
Looks slick not really any better than your average binder 
Trying to organize 
If you want luggage tags 
Disappointed 
I far prefer the LapGear DELUXE LapDesk over this LapGear Jumbo LapDesk. 
Could use a better surface or a ridge on the bottom. 
It's Okay But There Are Easier Ways To Get The Job Done 
Cool design 
Nice colors too easily smeared -- nothing special for the price 
A little messy 
Maybe I got a bad batch 
Brilliant colors- some ink flow issues 
Decent pens 
Neat for kids 
best for 4 to 5-year-olds 
I think they put the wrong age groups on the cover. 
Practice of Number Writing Made Easy 
Numbers yes; Stories no. 
May Work For Some Pre-Schoolers But Too Easy for Kindergardners 
Not sure where the number \stories\ comes into play 
Not a bad idea however.... 
Best for the summer between K & 1st grade 
How to build a sentence. 
Helpful to my daughter for her cursive letters 
I nice intro to creative writing but simplistic 
Nice concept 
Better suited for 1st and 2nd grade 
It's OK 
HELPFUL FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH WRITING 
If you work with 2nd graders...pass this by 
Colorful but... 
Basic Writing Prompts 
Another simple idea overpriced 
Basic building blocks for writing skills 
Very heavy duty. 
Decent board but make sure you buy some different pens 
HI 
All these scales are the same! 
Home-Brew 
Greenwashing ... 
Thick plastic tab attachments for folders 
Smead Easy Slide Tabs - Decent Innovation But Still A Work In Progress 
Not quite what I was expecting 
maybe a good product but not for universally for everyone 
These labels work great but cost too much 
Way Too Expensive 
Great quality labels at a high cost 
Ok but 
Good Quality but Too Big! 
Decent paper shredder but not so good for credit cards 
So So Shredder 
Works but too loud for small office! 
average  nothing sectacular nothing bad.  just a good price. 
Wish Someone Would Build a Better Lap Desk 
I've had blenders that work beter. 
Too bad 
Three Stars 
Bargus 
Sticky Notes with Not So Much Stick.. 
How come none in plain old white??????? 
Good in Some Situations 
Not as advertised but usable 
Keep tabs on your notes 
for the anal retentive but too expensive 
Quite Flimsy 
Beware! 
Not comfortable for me but a decent chair for a smaller frame that needs good support 
It Has Potential But Not for Husky Guys Like Me 
Some good some bad things with this chair 
Nice Office/Computer Chair 
Intek Refill Kit 
N700 Speaker Lapdesk - Imperfect But It Fills A Niche 
Is a great printer until....*don't buy it 
Excellent except for Ink Useage 
I LOVE this printer BUT. . . 
Concerns about color quality 
Great printing epic setup 
Ink Eater 
Frustrating... 
Decent footrest but weak fan. 
Could be much better 
OK as a footrest.. climate control not so much 
Low on the List of Necessary Products but It Helps My Back 
Five-star concept two-star execution. 
Noisy fan.  Footrest too thick for long legs in flat position. 
Maybe it's us but we can't seem to get it to work...? 
nice little office device 
Solid construction; I wish it were more adaptable 
Has some flaws but the wife seems to enjoy it. 
good support but fan stopped working. 
It's OK... 
Perfect for the office 
Great prints but no more Kodak 
Foot Rocker Needs Improvements.... 
Item will not go together as descibed. If you have enough room to get a good angle it is a comfortable rest 
Hmmm 
Needs more features and a wider range of adjustable options 
Can't get the wheels on 
Tough to assemble squeaky no manual 
Did Not Assemble Properly 
difficult to erase 
Not how I thought it would work  ~ 
Just your basic pen 
Not exactly what i am used to from Bic. 
Good sharpener with some drawbacks 
Weigh Your options carefully 
Bogs down easy but does well with re-sharpening 
Not Bad But Not Great 
Nice looking sharpener 
iPoint  Pencil Sharpener Does the Job But Lacks Visible Support 
Grinder 
Acceptable but not great 
Bit expensive for the power! 
Sharpens fine but user experience is less than ideal 
Not too terribly impressed 
Average pencil sharpener with great design 
Know of better sharpeners 
Takes too long; can't get a really sharp point 
Thoroughly Adequate 
Ok for low use but not meant for anything more 
Pretty good but not great - 3.5 stars 
Great Pencil Sharpener Except . . . 
You'll need the cleaner for sure 
BIC Dry Erase Marker Kit 
nice replaceable eraser! 
Great cleaning but... 
Limited Use--Must Have a Flat Wall 
Thin & rough velvet \velcro\ 
Still has the problem of attaching in a humid climate 
Roughly equivalent to mirror mounting tape in strength 
Not intended for use on windshield 
Strong fastener with inadequate adhesive 
Smooth writing but the barrel is friable 
Not the best pens for the price. 
wish the pen felt a little nicer 
'Professional Look' a 'Triumph' for BIC. Writes you know like Hemingway or Palin even. 
Not ideal for a lefty and a bit larger than \fine\ 
An acceptable writing implement 
The temperamental pen 
Good pen for those with carpal tunnel or arthritis 
Good Markers But... 
Rather clunky 
It works but is it necessary? 
Cute and handy but best for the true Post-It fan 
Small Convenience At A Small Cost 
Convenient but average product 
cute post-It despenser 
Uses non-standard post-it's and plastic dispenser is tacky 
It's OK but pricey for what it is 
Completely unnecessary little widget works well enough for clutter-freaks 
A Simple Holder for Post-It Notes; Entire Pad Comes Out Too Easily 
Typical post-it dispenser 
OK not miraculous 
Another option for Post-it lovers but not as good as expected 
Handy  but unnecessary Post-It holder 
Non-Essential But Handy In The Right Environment 
It Sounds Good In Theory 
Cute & Handy Pop Ups 
Another Plastic Gadget 
Pop-up works but velcro doesn't 
works wall-mount is a nice touch but do you need it? 
Post-it has let me down 
Handy but...Doesn't use regular post its! 
I'm iffy about Kodak in general 
Good Quality But. 
Good Price 
It's Okay......... 
Same Old Problems but probably the best of the lot 
very tiny but good 
acceptable 
Evil Necessity 
phones 
Nothing special about these 
The long cord is a problem for me 
Swingline Retractable Badge Reel 
Good on pocket or belt 
Colorful badge reels! 
About average 
decent but so many options out there 
No alligator clip limited ways to clip 
Good Idea 
Nice colors good price though spring is pretty weak... 
Not quite what I was hoping for 
Not that much of an upgrade 
A Functional Pad 
Inexpensive but Limited 
Hard to use 
Good printer/scanner 
Could be worse could be much better 
Crease machine overall very good 
Good OEM Ink but a poor combo 
Its heart is in the right place. 
Better than expected but a little pricy for cardboard I think 
Nice idea literally a bit rough around the edges 
Good idea but lacks in execution 
Very ROUGH binder 
so so 
Too Light in Weight. 
CUTE but Looks and Feels Cheap. 
Cool design but needs added weight too light and will fall over easily 
A fashion statement but not very useful 
Cute 
Cute but Flimsy 
Fun but Lacks Some Function 
Cute but needs improvement! 
Cute girly gift but a little top-heavy 
Cute item but too lightweight 
Only for 2 handed tape dispensing 
Cute but needs a lot more weight 
It's adorable but... 
Really cute. 
Darling but it IS too lightweight 
Good probably not worth the small downsides 
Convenient but unnecessary 
Good product but not as good as it could be (3 1/2 stars) 
Do I Really Need Another Gadget? 
gets the job done but 
Works very well but expensive to use. 
A pretty nice specialized product -but not for everyone. 
A better mousetrap. 
Underwhelmed 
Nice Concept But Not That Practical 
Nice Albeit Pricey Tape Dispenser. Functions as Advertised. Made for Gadget Fans or Those Who Like to Use Pre-Cut Tape Pieces. 
Handy but perhaps a bit overdesigned 
Still Can't Beat A Roll Of Scotch Tape But...... 
Not very practical or economical 
Cute little item but maybe not for a desk at work 
Just OK 
A Handy But Pricey Tape Dispenser 
just a gadget.. 
Am I not doing this right? 
Great idea but flawed 
It's a great idea but . . . 
OK But Not Great 
A once-a-year purchase 
Okay for specific purposes 
It sticks! 
OK The Lazy Person In Me 
Fun and kinda handy but a product few people need 
Once you how to set it up . . . 
Convienence at a cost. 
Interesting concept but hardly an improvement in tape dispensing 
Good for kids or the office but not for everything. 
fun but I'm not crazy about specialty refills 
more of a gimmick 
Good concept. ok execution 
Have to buy special tape packets for it 
Handy but it doesn't really stick to a desk 
Serves the purpose - nothing too special 
Good for Paper and really light stuff ... 
good but not as safe  as you might think 
Good but do you really need it? 
great way to hang items 
They are ok 
Nice for light stuff. 
Wow!  Sticky! 
Great if you only have posters to hang (Revised review) 
Couldn't handle a poster 
sticks to most things very well but doesn't remove from paper 
Useful in certain circumstances - 3-1/2 stars 
For Lightweight Mounting: A Scotch Reusable Tabs R100 Review 
pretty good for light weight objects 
good idea but? 
Useful for select applications 
So much more attractive than strips of tape 
Strongly recommended as a substitute for tacks (beware of painting removal from your walls) 
A Good Idea for Those Who Can Use Them 
Nice Idea But Limited Uses 
Sticky yes... perhaps too sticky 
cute but flimsy 
Cute but doesn't feel very sturdy 
flimsy 
Try harder next time 
Fine .. for kindergarten 
This tape is okay...... 
It's Tape 
The tape we have known for years in a slightly revised dispenser 
At the end of the day it's just tape 
Loch Ness Tape dispenser 
Better Than Glue?  In Some Ways Yes Others No 
Nice concept but adhesive not that strong 
Definitely useful for selective tasks but a bit expensive 
Not good not bad 
not what I expected 
Gadget; but is it a serious tool? 
Good For Scrapbooking 
great product but not environmentally friendly 
A great alternative to traditional tape & gluesticks but not so permanent... 
May be great for some purposes but not so great for mine. 
Good alternative to double-sided tape poster putty and tacks 
Great for light stuff 
Reusable Within Limits 
Fine for paper & cards but won't hold much else 
Work well but not very strong. 
A temporary solution but not a great one. 
Great product at first but... 
Not up to the task 
Not exactly \super sticky\ but convenient idea 
Neat Idea 
Doesn't stick how's that super sticky? 
Great concept but doesn't stick to EVERYTHING 
Great Idea! 
Not in love ~ 
Works but covers up a lot on the page 
I'm Rather Organized But Have Zero Use For These 
Good concept but not as practical as I'd like 
Over the top 
Labels are huge which is good for writing; too sticky though 
Useful in a fairly limited way. 
Thin glue can get messy. Dries white so don't use for clear products. 
BEST super glue and I'll tell ya why 
It is what it is 
Each Tube a Single Use 
Not For Free Endicia Postage Accounts 
good for now! 
Inadequate Word List In My Opinion 
Average to Good Gadget 
Good tool for elementary grades 
Great for kids. A little limited for adult needs. 
Not much better than the competitor... 
Decent scanner room for improvement 
Slow Time Consuming 
Messy 
Lots of Features but a Few Fell Short 
Very cute questionable dimensions of inner compartments 
Useful but not very deep 
Functional but pricey... 
I thought it would be sturdier 
Slightly Oversized 
Pretty Organization Sometimes Frustrating 
Narrower than it appears 
Expensive wherever you buy it & hard to use 
Narrow Tidy-Looking Has a Small Footprint 
As a standard cordless phone it's average 
Nice-looking commodious 
It's a pleather letter tray no more no less. 
BIC Great Erase Have their Use 
Just OK 
not dark enough 
Not so smelly but not so vivid - stick w/Black 
Good pens but a bit light. 
Colors are very light not what is shown 
Not as great as I had hoped 
Could be very handy but it isn't without flaws 
Handy but not that exciting 
Post-its in a paper dispenser 
It's fine but nothing special 
handy -- but is it really necessary? 
Don't really use it too much... 
Overrated 
Maybe for Post-It die-hard fans? 
Works ... but ... WHHYYY???? 
Fair To Middlin' 
Neat concept but... 
Does what it says 
Cute but hard to use 
Fun but not particularly practical 
Like the idea 
Just when you thought they had done all they can with sticky notes 
There's not much to say;  it's a post it note + dispenser 
Not that useful 
Fun product a million applications not enough post-its in a pack 
OK product 
It's OK. 
Nice post-its but I don't use them very often. Quite pointless in the electronic age 
Good idea not so great execution. 
Difficult delivery system 
Well-designed but could be more durable 
Hmmm....fairly flimsy and missed the mark 
It's Post-It Notes 
Great idea that loses value for mobile travelers and budget minded users 
Hard to refill horrible colors sticky residue 
Great notes but not necessary 
I Just Don't Get It 
Nothing to write home about 
...a great idea nonetheless 
Good for a cubicle 
Different but not better. 
Okay but get's used up real fast 
Not bad but a little disappointing 
Convenient but unnecessary 
They're Okay 
Just OK 
Maybe useful for somebody 
Just ok. 
Slightly Convenient but not worth the effort 
dispensing is nice limited applications 
I like the table top not the hand dispenser 
Useful and convenient in limited application 
Get the Refillable Deskgrip Dispenser -- Not This One 
I like the handband dispenser... 
I think I'll stick with my old desktop tape dispenser 
Very convenient for Christmas Eve. 
Kind of neat Kind of a pain... 
A tale of two tape dispensers: one I liked;  the other not so much 
Eh. Kind of awkward 
ingenious tabletop dispenser but wrist dispensers lacking 
good not great with too many flaws for me to buy again 
Good for quick jobs nice multi pack 
ok- doesn't roll 
I coulda' been a Five Star contender .... 
More like 792 Labels -- Good Quality Though... 
good labels 
Okay but not great. Too thin! 
Does the job 
Great product just over-priced 
Yes these are temporary labels 
Nice idea for more uses of the Post-It Notes. 
Hard to peel off the pad! 
Faint Praise From a Post-It Addict 
Fine for temporary labeling 
Great quick little labels but not a replacement for a label maker 
Worked great on some surfaces but not others 
Too sticky for me 
Good Labels 
Sticks 
Ok good inks 
Too Heavy for Road Warriors/Bad with Receipts 
disappointing 
Perfect for small messages. Packaging Issue 
Message & Note Board 
Serviceable gets the job done 
Milky pens cheap feel to it. 
Not the quality I was expecting 
It's good for attention-getting notes 
not as nice as expected 
Pretty colors pop on black background 
A little hard to read 
Kind of fun for a change of pace 
Better in Theory Than Practice [3.5 Stars] 
Good product but colors fade 
Mostly same old same old 
Average quality; nothing special 
A decent set. 
These work well enough 
More than I needed..... 
Brown is the New Green 
Kraft Paper Cover Stains Easily 
Very eco-friendly but not as functional or sturdy as I'd like ... 
Has Potential! 
Love the feel. 
Sturdy Brown Notebook Made of Mostly Recycled Materials; Can Not Be Customized; There are No Storage Pockets! 
Recycled goodness.  Basic functionality. 
Not a heavy duty cover 
Stripped Down But Stylish 
Over-priced and over-hyped - its a binder 
Recycled material and fun option for customization 
Ok binder good starting point. 
Nice But Pricey 
Nice that they are recycled 
Darling but thin 
Nice look but... 
One time use 
It's Ok for an HP 
Some intriguing new features but not everything you'd want; quality is fine for ordinary use but not professional 
Conflicts with Sony 
VERY NICE  FOR THE  PRICE ! 
Doesn't last as long as I'd like... 
Slightly Tight Fit 
Board good Pen bad. 
Mine won't stick :-( 
Get a different marker 
Awesome boards dud marker 
Convenient but there are flaws 
Only one sticks... 
Great concept 
Don't stick well small writing surface 
Great idea.  But there are a few small problems 
Not For Me 
Perfect for memos but one board can't be used out of the box 
Great Little Magnets Not So Good Marker 
Functional solidly built but marker will need to be replaced 
Ink is just too expensive. We are suckers buying these products but we don't have a choice. 
Very expensive 
ALL ink is outrageous! 
TOO DANG HIGH 
Portable 
eco friendly but skimpy 
Just Okay 
Seems expensive for what it is 
So-so notebook 
A bit too light for my tastes 
ku-jaku (Peacock) 
Gorgeous blue....extremely wet!  Test with your paper first! 
It tapes 
Good tape.  Holder sometimes doesn't hold. 
not superior to the usual 
Nothing really new 
Kind of average ink jet printer at this price range. 
Good scanner but why does scanning require ink?! 
Could have been better 
Good not great pencil sharpener 
Blast from the past 
Sharpens well but no instructions 
Just got 
A basic notebook 
It's paper. 
Very thin & flimsy cardboard front and back 
The Most Basic of Notebooks 
OK 
Not the usual Mead quality. 
Standard Notebooks Decently Priced 
Fine but nothing special. 
Good paper quality perforated pages fall out. 
Not as Good as the Older Ones 
So-So Spiral Notebooks 
Hefty notebook but poor paper quality 
Not sure who would use it. 
Lots of pages but week spiral 
Just too bulky for me 
The cloth accents and lack of a tri-fold design makes this NOT the Trapper Keeper I recall 
Same Simple Design From When I was a Kid 
Adequate at best 
but it's like after 30 years 
OK for medium-duty use 
Not all that secure 
Weak Binder Rings Overall Good Lightweight System 
Rings are awkward for me to use comes with paper graph paper dividers and handout & pen holders 
Useful 
Those rings gotta go 
Good files but bad closing mechanism. 
Nice Pocket File but with one major ergonomic issue (adding/removing documents) 
The actual product is fine 
Harder and more brittle than I was expecting 
Fine.  Sturdy.  Exactly what you'd expect. 
Nice file 
Limited Expansion 
Average Binder 
They'll slap on the 5-star onto anything anymore 
A Little Overpriced ... 
Asset is pocket cover the rest is nothing special 
I would trade the clearview cover for interior pockets 
Clunky spine design 
Versatile but Questionable Durability 
Eh I'm Not Feeling This One... 
Flexible 
Weak Binder Rings Overall Good Lightweight System 
An interesting idea that I didn't like in practice 
A Binder for Those Who Don't Like Binders 
Thoughts from a lefty 
HP satisfies again 
Not the Best purchase

Good but very expensive 
It does a good job.

Great product but the price is a gouge. Hence the 3 star review. 
Ink Prints Great! 
As advertised. 
Ink 
printer ink

Good product but outrageously priced. 
Incomplete 
Still too expensive 
Nice to have a value pack; not a better deal than the Sophia Global alternative ink cartridges. 
Works with MG8220 
Basic functionality but not basic pricing. 
Thin it works.
