A Good album 
\Can I stroke you up!\ 
Keep it slow ladies... 
ohmygod! it's Pet Sounds. wuptifreakin'do 
Over Hyped 
Looks like I'm swimming against the tide but whatever 
anticlimatic at best 
Wouldn't It Be Nice...? 
Pet Sounds 
I wish I could like this more 
&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; surround mix basically 4.0 
Influential and important? Sure. Great? Not so much. 
Dated 
Essential Jazz Album for Your Music Library! 
Gorgeously tired

3 songs 
Enjoyable from beginning to end.

Not one of his bests 
overrated 
Not his strongest effort but still good 
basic beats less fury 
Is an album that was great but is dated now still good? 
his first solo album 
R. Kelly invents himself on 2nd album. 
Good solo debut 
Good album overdoes it on the bump and grind stuff 
BackBack or forth and forth 
R. Kelly featuring Aaliyah

This CD is OK. 
A group for today but not for posterity

More fun from 'little' Elvis

An impressive album 
Nice Roger Dean Cover 
Guilty Pleasure 
popular? 
Non-commercial/commercial Joni 
I like the title track

1986  \Mechanical Resonance\. 
Robbie's first solo recording... 
Broken Arrow 
Hippy Drippy Folk Rock 
Great back up band 
And missing every one of them

Not one of my favorites.......um well.....i cant say it.... 
Soundtrack music 
Trip-hop trips up a little 
princess tracey! 
&quot;Protection&quot; left vulnerable by high expectations 
protection 
HORRIBLE except for &quot;i got 5 on it&quot; 
Had its moments 
Hint of greatness to come 
three decent tracks; rest average 
Cool beats from the mid-1990s British Invasion

Feels Like Home 
Neneh should have more industry clout

Dated but Fun 
Pretty Good

Average Underwhelming and Immature - 3 Stars 
Toni's breakthrough album. 
Only Slightly Above Average 
Toni Braxton can put you in the mood. 
It's R&B but there's not a lot of \soul\ here 
A decent sophomore effort... 
Gotta Love Her Voice! 
Quite Frankly This Could Have Been Better. MUCH Better. 
Outkast cash in 
Good Not Great!! 
Thug? Gangsta? what??? 
Strong entry for his catalog 
Good but NOT GREAT

Before they wore out their welcome.... 
Technically impressive craziness leaves room for songwriting maturity 
Good But Overrated

They Forgot To Include 'After The Dance' & More! 
Prophetic? 
As much as I love Johnny Gill... 
So-So! 
Let's Get the Mood Right 
All The Great Singles! -1 +2 =? 
PLEASE  someone out there help me! 
Not bad but the flaw is the edited versions of LH and ANMHE!!! 
Missing Medley 
I liked it but was not blown away. 
Not required listening but at times rewarding 
Skip a few love the rest 
a final album of cover versions and his last of the 1960s

The energy's gone 
Characters needs soul

Provocative 
Good effort though not as strong as Johnny Gill 
A Simple Waste Well Almost 
Hard to believe this botched set is still in print... 
\SURRENDER\ Missing 
A Long Long Conversation 
OK but still lacks that 70's magic 
3-1/2 stars 
3 1/2 stars--I liked it more back then 
Pretty good... 
Too many cooks spoil the chocolate mousse 
A bit dry of a debut but I think they're onto something 
They got better after this

BIG PROMISE BUT WAY OVERRATED !! 
Worthwhile! 
A Great Choice For The E.J. Fan Who Has It All 
The real reason to get this is the \Friends\ album tracks 
Cameo 
All and all...it cannot compare to the earlier TFF 
Hot and cold 
Contains some good songs and a ton of photos of the band's lead singer 
Great but look elsewhere if more than a casual Abba fan 
Ain't Enough Meat On These Bones 
Live 1992 Concert Mixes Old And New Songs. 
Magic of Red Rocks and the Orchestra is there - Production is Not 
Scorching sex-a-thon still relevant 
Some great moments 
a country band with a rock attitude 
Some great singles mixed with real losers. 
3 big hits omitted 
LIVIN' ON MY HAIR 
The Band Truly Reached a &quot;Cross Road&quot; in their Careers 
Great CD 
Decent Start...but hopefully a better one will come along 
Made in England 
High peaks coupled with low valleys= OK 
A mixed bag of Grant and Donald  treats 3.5 stars

Source of several much-played 1970 songs. 
A very nice album 
Elton John Is Just Not All There 
Good debut

uneven concept album from the tin pan alley twins 
A Couple of Good Songs 
IT IS NOT GYBR! 
How fantastic? 
Elton Takes A Stab At Significance 
Far from Elton's best 
The Tone Can Just Drone 
Go for the box set instead

Pretty good material

My opinion - for what it's worth 
A Tentative Debut 
Young  For What He's Worth  Saves it! 
first album 
Jackson Browne out 
Someone's choice for &quot;best of&quot; but not the right one 
One man's best is another man's....

Triple threat

Try to imagine what silence looks like. 
MOST Over-rated album of the Genius known as Prince DO NOT buy first! 
Not bad but they've done a little better

I like the CD but wish it was only the original song line up without the bonus tracts.

Balance & Options REVIEW! 
3 Stars 
Not a masterpiece but contains two great singles. 
Honest Brutal and Afraid of You 
Leave The Singing To Stuart Murdoch 
Just about half good 
Confused mild success 
Decent but doesn't hold a candle to &quot;Sinister&quot; 
There is more and better 
Great tunes but lacking 
Ups and Downs 
Brutality at its best 
Good Album 
Eminem 
Overrated slighty dated but still brilliant in spots 
Some great rap but it's definitly not pretty. 
Not impressed 
Funny lyrics and.....what else? 
this is one nasty sick MFer!!!!

This was rushed; could have been better 
Chocolate Starfish Hot Dog Water Mix 
The New Street Fighters 
I won't totally flame this CD but... 
What happened to Durst &amp; Co.? 
Not really special generic 
Infantile laughable retarded yet catchy. 
Music you can jam to but talent is lacking 
Combine the first two albums and you get this one

A nice change but................. 
Oh so average 
Same as Significant Other but... 
The downward spiral continued 
Solid Debut

Flawed Jewel 
Different Does Not Mean Bad

good pop cd 
Maybe It Seemed Better On Paper... 
What Happened? 
A Sleepy Albumyet Rock oriented 
Good but doesn't do much for me... 
Good pop-rock sound but married to uneven songwriting. 
Some steps forward but still way too glossy 
Slowly succumbing to the curse of formula 
Good but not as good as &quot;The Spirit Room&quot; 
This had the ability to be so much better.... 
Could Have Been So Much Better!  Not All Remixes! 
Again nice to hear different versions of her songs

Feels like &quot;Fumbling...&quot; all over again 
A Career in Danger 
Should Be Better Than This 
Beautiful At Times Powerful But Most of the Time Just Slow and Average 
A missed opportunity 
We've been waiting 6 years for this?

Off to a good start 
One song for the time capsule and a bunch of promise 
Average (at best) 
Promises of Promise 
Good Effort; Lots of Potential; Nalick shouldn't be afraid to move out of her Comfort Zone 
Good songs lots of potential terrible production 
Where is album no. 2? 
Something to look forward to

(3.5 stars). Some awesome material mixed with some avarege one 
I HEARD ITAND I WAS NOT MOVED...LOOKS LIKE AN OK ALBUM 
really good 
Some sublime some merely ordinary 
Anyway. 
Pretty enough but many songs are forgettable 
Intriguing at first.  Surprisingly though the allure fades soon. 
Maybe I'm amazed... actually not. 
Sitting On The Fence Out In The Backyard 
Okay... 
Oh those expectations! 
Lets add a star and a half 
One of McCartney's Best but Not the Best 
Wildflower is a weed

As  Expected 
The Day After The Album!! 
Almost every track is about a girl... dang Twista 
A Solid Album 
Not bad 
What happened to the old twista 
Middling 
An OK album nothing to get excited over. 
It's not really what I expected?! 
Her head's in the clouds all right 
Twelve Years? Really? 
Milking the double discs 
Lulling narcotizing introspective mood pieces... 
Kate has mellowed 
Im a hardcore KB fan but this album is somewhat dull. 
Serenecontentedbut not very dynamic 
mothering heights 
3.14159265 
Birdie birdie birdie. Could have been a stunning single disc 
Far from a slam dunk 
I wasn't as impressed by this Liz Phair album... 
That's not Phair

NOT BAD...MAYBE 2 1/2 STARS 
Alicia Overhyped Keys 
It's not too shabby... 
Very Solid eclectic rock 
I Love the Band Hate the Destructive Software in the CD 
Please enter a title for your review 
Re-recording your most popular tracks years later doesn't always translate well 
A double disc... 
A good CD but misses its goal. 
I Don't Have This Record But I Have Created My Own Best Of Album 
Hits & Misses 
As one writer put it \An Iffy Collection.\ 
Not So Great As Their Previous Albums 
\From Me To You\ Is Better...... 
Juelz Santana ----- What the Game's Been Missing! 
Sophomore Jinxbut still good 
pretty good 
Quite Nice. 
3 1/2. Step ur lyrics up Juelz... 
This Sophmore effort is NOT that good 
Would they lie to you? 
I Was Thinking Of Something Sleek To Wrap Around My Tender Throat. 
Where Is Don't Ask Me Why? 
A quick but enjoyable look at their U.S. & U.K. hits respectively... 
+1/2 -- Modern country-pop from American Idol 
This was Good Not Great 
One of the strongest American Idol albums 
Good but lacking 
Oh There's Nothing Like Oklahoma 
Duets: The Final Chapter by The Notorious B.I.G. 
Forever King of New York 
(3.5 Stars) R.I.P. Biggie Smallz 
Biggie's Ready To Die but Puff won't let him 
let the man rest in peace 
my honest opinion 
Decent final chapter 
Biggie's Last Album Ends Up Very Limited 
Meh 
Nice Soothing Romantic Set 
A BIT SKIMPY & LACK OF VARIETY COMPARED TO 1ST CD 
Needs some work listen to the mixtape 
Fort Minor - The Rising Tied 
Nice concept and ideas 
An Album that Almost Gets it Right 
3-1/2 Stars -- Holding his own on his own 
Too Much Hype!!! 
(3.5 Stars) Good Effort....But Still Needs Some Fine Tuning.

Average to me 
this album aint all that 
I ALL READY KNEW THIS WAS NOT GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS CATER VOL1...NO DISS TO WAYNEBUT HIS FLOW IS STARTING TO SOUND LIKE JAY-Z 
Not great but not that awful 
Don't belive the hype 
A crossroad at the height of their career 
Until The Breakthrough... 
Not as good as the rest 
MJB:doing Her Best Mariah 
The Breakthrough 
Mediocre 
Honestly...... 
More Mary: Not Broken (or Fixed) 
Impressive gets better with each listen! 
PLEASE put the pen down Shakira 
Catchy in its own way 
Need To Wash & Dried In The Laundromatic!! 
I didn't develop a 'Fixation' for this album...... 
Nothing to be fixated about 
Volume 1 gets the prize. 
HOW DOES SHE DOES? 
It just kills me to write this... 
A Step Back 
Uncle Woody meets R.Kelly 
They're great...Which means they're not (see title of CD please) 
Unfair Expectations 
A Lesser Imitation... 
Keeps rock'n' roll going along fairly well 
A good first effort (but interesting to see if they grow) 
Not All That Great 
A Greatest Hits That Needs Improvement..... 
Barely gives me a buzz. 
A Good Starter Set but not Definitive-- 
good but not what I expected 
Luda & DTP 
(3.5 Stars) Better Than The 1st DTP Album But Still Room To Improve! 
Decent CD from an okay group. 
Not Luda 
pretty good Isley's album 
Solid collection with some very notable omissions 
pretty good Hits package 
Rock and roll is built on shopping. 
Madonna is still the master 
One more item of your OCD 
Not quite all of Oates and Hall. 
DRS said \This Is For...MY HOMIES!\  That's About All This CD Is For! 
Scarface should have left some of his \Homies\ at home this time around 
A Good Album from Scarface 
Strong Cd i wish there was more scarface on it 3.5 
Definitely not an album with general appeal 
new good and old still good 
yeah yeah 
YES ! (but only for die hard fans or as starting point) 
3-1/2 stars -- An improvement but he's still got some evolving to do 
It's Not Raw Enough (2.5 Stars) 
Robin Thicke's Got A Love Jones 
3 1/2 stars. Nice. 
A Pleasant Suprise But 'Deluxe Edition' ? NO WAY! 
Music in the Genes! 
3-1/2 stars -- Not quite purr-fect but still good 
The Don sounds a little tired. Some of the songs do too. 
Three stars is like dancing with your sister 
Whatever Happened to the H gang? 
Still Undecided. 
Good value but still missing many rare remixes?! 
Where's The Extended Versions Of \Erotic City\\Head\\Sexy Dancer\ and \Party Up\?? 
A DISSERVICE 
Ultimate Prince...? 
His royal badness 
Everytime I Hear This! 
the mainstreaming and death of vocal trance 
Not What I Expected! 
It's a good album but... 
trim the songs back 50% next time 
Where are the melodies? 
At War with the Mystics 
they might be human after all.... 
Less lingering 
Every Time You State Your Case 
What exactly does he want to do? 
LL 
Still Solid After All These Years.... 
UNCLE L 
You Need To Control Yourself! 
(3.5 Stars) 'Todd Smith' Gives Us An Okay Album....AGAIN!!! 
Is it a comeback for LL? 
A good effort for the veteran original \Prince of Rap\ 
Commercial But Got it's Fair Share of Good Songs 
A LOT of Filler 
Probably the only good cd out there. 
The CD has grown on me 
pretty cool elo album 
Good compilation of hits and history of the band 
Not the best of their stuff 
A Better Album Than Their First 
The potential is still there... 
THIS album should have been called Amerika'z Nightmare 
Its aight...need to get used to some of these songs. 
Mobb Deep - Blood Money 
Party's over tell the rest of the crew 
Slightly dissapointed... 
Mobb Deep took 50 Cent's \Blood Money\ so don't expect \The Infamous\ or \Murda Muzik\ anymore. 
Not Really that Bad Not Really that Good 
Dissapointing and weak for an MD joint not totally horrible. 
Dissapointment 
Actually it's a 3.5 effort... 
RED HOTS Fade to GREY 
Mainstream fare and overrated 
Here's my two cents. 
Not As Good As I Hoped It Would Be 
Pink Warm Cherry Tomatoes 
Twice as many winners twice as much junk 
There's a great single album in here. 
Would Be Much Better As A Single Disc 
Homogeneous Production Stifles Virtues 
As VIBE Magazine said \Not on THESE streets\ 
Not Bad I hoped that it would've been better 
very good 
(Rating 6 Out Of 10): It's A Good Experimental Album Just Not For Me... 
They Say I'm CRAAAAYYYZZAAAAYYY! 
I hate when record companies do this 
Nothing Fits Quite Like Polyester. 
Not Quite An MVP 
Why only three stars? Well... 
Not an equal partnership 
'Pimpalation' Doesn't Live Up To The UGK Name. 
This is gonna be a real killa for himself! 
3.5 Stars not bad but not too good either 
5th Time Arround 
TIMING CAN BE A KILLA...... 
KILLA! 
Yes this is a departure 
Pretty good for a freshman album. 
Between two extremes. 
Good first album from Yung Joc 
20/20 hearing with unnecessary corrective surgery 
rapping and good production

(3.5 Stars) Field Mob Getting Better With Time 
its the new mob

Unfortunately 2006 Doesn't Belong To Dmx! :( 
Same ol' s*it 
Why have the definitive when the Ultimate is coming?? 
not  bad for the New Steely Dan Fan or Casual 
The collection earns four stars but this re-release concept barely gets two stars. Why you ask? 
Waiting for 'Watley' 
Ridin' medium 
It's not \Living Legends\ but \Ridin' High\ is still worth checking out

Flawed but brave project

space puffs in my mind 
Decent But Not Their Best

Not quite a Nightmare; Hardly a Favourite 
great band but this one disapoints 
Breathe deeply . . . 
A bit of Test For Echo syndrome 
Rush going through the motions 
They try to let the old fans captured by a few citations of their glorious past in order to bring them into the arenas!!

An ambitious bombastic whimper 
I hear... 
Pretty if somewhat monotonous 
Two Styles - One is Great 
a lot of money for lo-fi 
I kinda want to like it (or lick it?) 
Beach OK 
Some Stains on this Album 
Bright flashy beautiful but too unoriginal 
hmm not that good 
Department store tunes that occasionally shine 
One to watch but the cat's gotta go.

Pop Rock 
Vintage Alanis but... 
A Slight Return To Form

Funked up...

Review of Vinyl Version 
Okay! 
Overplayed 
I like 2 songs the album was cheap so I got it. 
I'm sitting on the fence about MUSE... 
It's not a good album or a bad album. It's just a Muse album.

Music for backgrounds

Not up to par 
Free
