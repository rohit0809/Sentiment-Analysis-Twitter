It was fun for a little while

You can feed the baby but you can't get her wet.  Huh? 
Kids love this 
Messy but my 4 yr old loved it! 
What's that smell?  Baby Alive! 
Nice addition to the Littlest Petshop line.

A Horror To Unpack! 
Better for a younger child terrible speaker

Unfortunately No! We are Big Fans of Melissa & Doug! But NOT this flashlight! 
Cute but not really sure how to use it!

Not sure I got a finished product but... 
Not great but not bad either

Moon Dough Fun 
At first a novelty but I think it will be a forgotten toy in our house. 
Good idea but needs refinement 
Kids loved it while it lasted 
Good. Simply put - playdough alternative. 
Fun but needlessly messy 
Weird but cute too messy for solo play. 
Fun but messy 
Dough does not stay together very well pieces everywhere 
Lacking in quite a few areas 
Interesting texture 
Ok 
Confused with the packaging and commercials etc. 
not something kids should play with alone

Hard to use

Nice Product But Requires Downloads for Additional Books 
Very cool but who's it for? 
Decent educational toy but quirky sync software and limited titles 
May work better for your child. 
Compared to the iPad this isn't very exciting for my 3yo. 
Not Thrilled With This

I have mixed feelings

The sound isn't very good

Sounds more fun than it turned out to be 
Not all that impressed... 
One shot Wonder 
Pretty but Flimsy 
Not for 5 year olds

Cheap

It is difficult to put back together. 
Nice 
Could be better 
Kids like it mom not so much 
Cute set but wish it had a whistle or harmonica. 
It's a pen? No it's a penpencil. 
A bit too much like a bad pen 
Cool Concept Flawed Implementation 
An Erasable Pen With an Identity Complex 
Neat concept erases well 
Nice Idea but not as great in the hand 
Great for pen people who need a #2 pencil for tests not for sketching or drawing 
Excellent for paragraphs frustrating for short notes 
Erasable for a few hours not three days 
Headed in the right direction ... 
Good once you get the hang of the shrinking..... 
Glue doesn't work 
Good toy; price here is outrageous 
Super Cute

Good value and price. Need more flight time 
Probably OK In A Different Application 
Fun but Messy 
NO REFILLS 
Not recommended for beginners: simulator needed 
Okay but not for young children...not like coloring should be! 
Not what I thought it was 
Fun but smelly 
If your not a model builder it's your only option 
Best rendtion of the 1701-E I have seen yet. 
5 year old loves it but... 
Thought it was bigger 
The surprise was the size 
Great toy lasts about a day 
Good but small 
Wish I could give it 4 stars 
It's a doll 
More than a deck building game but with a caviat 
Some issues but otherwise fun. 
Cute and fun but delicate 
It is a cute cart but not very sturdy. 
Cute but flimsy 
The Blocks are small 
terrible cover design for battery pack

MY Christmas Present 
Disappointing gun but still good 
Would not buy for young child. 
Great for little ones. 
cute cheap 
Cute rings but they don't stay together 
When my step granson opened it I didn't see him even play with it 
the noise THE NOISE! 
Just ok 
Wasn't worth the money I paid 
Will do the job but cheap 
could be more durable 
Great while it lasts 
Straight from the 90's 
Ok 
Very light  weight 
Fun but doesn't hold attention for long. 
Hard to attach 
My son loves it but... 
You get what you pay for 
You get a lot for the price but they are very poor quality 
Not bad 
So-so 
Cute but.... 
Not bad but not good! 
Fun but breaks easily 
Nice color but they break quickly 
Fun gadget for party 
Three Stars 
nice flashing rings 
OK but cheaper at dollar store 
Inexpensive party favors but... 
Not the best quality but inexpensive. 
Not a hit with my 2-1/2-year-old 
Cute and cuddly 
Looks better in pictures than in real life... 
Cute But Overpriced...... 
Daughter thinks it's a \friendly baby monster\ not a bunny 
overall good 
Music=great Juno's voice=Not 
Well-intentioned but... ack! Those voices! 
Not my kids' favorite music 
Music That's Not Totally Annoying 
The discription is incorrect 
Lukewarm for Tots 
Rhythm is Everywhere 
This isn't a bad DVD at all 
Needs to be Part of a Larger Education 
Didn't do a thing for my daughter 
Go for the real thing. 
Not to Bad for Original Music. 
Fun but not as fun as the DVD 
This is a fine CD not action baby music 
Modern orchestral classical music for kids who are Juno Baby Fans 
If your child is really into Juno then he or she will probably really like it 
Pretty Annoying. 
Music is fine but voices are annoying 
Different product 
This is a cute CD 
Good Music Annoying Voices 
Good...but skip the cat 
Probably helps to know the characters 
Indifferently received by 2-1/2-year-old 
A knowledgeable teachers that fails to get the student's attention 
bus 
Cute...her crown broke though. 
Cute doll 
Good for the price I guess 
Not many biblical tools for young ones UPDATED 
It's okay but I wouldn't play it again 
An interesting though ultimately flawed step for deck-builders 
TY Beanie Baby Eleanor 
a little cheeper than I expected 
not bad 
Could stand to be stronger 
Okay. 
not bad 
Decent 
Not the best but not the worst 
Good Flash Cards 
A Few Good Shots 
Good volume spray but pump-to-squirt means you have no long range accuracy 
Cool idea but inferior to the cheaper Scatter Blast 
Fun but there are better options 
If Looks Could \Kill\ 
It works but it's the worst of the competition 
not nerfs best water gun.... 
Works but you won't win the water war with this one. 
Awesome idea but no real advantage 
Fun 
Nice set of sheets could be packaged better 
Just okay 
Too hard for preschoolers 
Innovation Review by Dad's Gaming Addiction 
Faster and smoother turns but not necessarily better overall. 
good for easter baskets 
It was ok 
Just ok 
Like this book but not sure why some of the examples for letters were used 
Big Birds Voice over and over and over 
For costume 
Cool flashlight but nothing more 
Just a fun-looking flashlight 
All looks no action 
It has grown on me... 
Take a trip around the world. 
Made for very small fingers. 
Small enough to be a choking hazard for young children 
Cute and kids Love them but you get what you pay for 
Looks like Maximus but lacks the cuddle factor 
Cute Doll Daughter Loves It Hair Is Messy! 
Not at all what I expected 
Cute 
Over-priced fun! 
Good concept bad execution 
good for a few giggles but could get boring in a hurry 
Full of crap and facts! 
Marginally entertaining 
Overall a fairly fun game 
It's Fun Once 
Fact: you can probably find a better trivia game 
Kind of fun 
Fun but overly silly 
fun here and there but we're unlikely to play it again 
Could have been better!

Very Annoying Toy 
Ok toy

Good idea and entertains baby but the execution of product is average 
Shoes Wisely :) 
Do not buy if you get annoyed by repetitive loud toys 
Other toys are better

Not a popular toy 
Great toy for a young child

Nice \first tablet\ for a young child 
Make sure you have the time for this toy 
Why are Lego's so expensive

It's ok little annoying! 
Good Game when it doesn't lock up!!!

Not one of my son's favorites 
Its OK 
Hard to understand the teacher 
Great game

OKAY TRAIN 
Not a Puzzle - More a Model 
More model than puzzle 
A step by step project challenge is in getting the pieces to stay 
A 3D building set; not a 3D puzzle. 
More of a Model than Puzzle 
Not for me 
Okay but not what we expected... 
Not so much a puzzle as it is a build-by-numbers model 
Not really a puzzle 
3-D puzzle 
The word \puzzle\ is a bit misleading... 
Not quite like other ravensburger puzzles. 
Great Concept For A Puzzle But Flimsy Design 
Good fun product but wished.. 
Really Didn't Enjoy This 
Pleasing Puzzle but Pieces too Interchangeable 
Another quality Ravensburger Puzzle 
For Older Kids 
Gorgeous but difficult 
Cool not as cool as it appears 
while age six and up might be a stretch a teen and adult group not tv addicted might find this diverting 
Nice but too easy 
Good puzzle but 3D effect is minimal 
My 5 year old did it in 15 minutes 
HUGE puzzle and too many pieces can connect even when they don't actually go together 
Be forewarned; finger cramps and strained hearing come with these entertaining little creatures... 
Now I'm thinking about being one for Halloween. 
A bit disappointing... 
Hmmm My Kids Love This  But I'm a Bit Confused 
Press (and press again) the Belly 
Wait for the next generation...

Not worth it 
Fun but fragile and loud 
Day 35 and counting 
Loud Motor and can easily break

My kids aren't crazy about it 
It's a hit or miss sort of toy.

Attention-keeping toy not one to \cuddle\

Eh 
Easier use than older model still not much you can do with it 
A childhood wish fulfilled 
Nostalgic but not practical 
Ok 
pam 
Has not improved with age! 
Definitely a toy oven 
My daughter loves this price for extras not so much!!! 
For a child this is a great little oven. 
Great minifigs but a so-so speeder 
Not A Set Designed For Play 
Not sure of the appeal 
Good but not Great

Plain old Play-doh is best! 
Fun but not for the long-term 
Play-doh makes dough off this 
Potty doll 
Fun but short-lived Fun 
Cute but pricey to continually feed 
Decent doll added expense can be offputting 
Technical review only - actually fairly traditional doll 
Fun for a bit but imagination trumps simulation 
Great for the imagination not a \learning\ toy 
Good toy much loved enough room for two to play 
Bought for my daughter 
The wheel just doesn't stay on. Frustrating. 
Engages ANY Child 
Should have been more 
Fun set with lots of play but overpriced 
Not the greatest set by far and beware of false list price

Storage & carry along 
Better Than The Trunkie! 
Bag is Flat 
Serve the purpose but smell 
Not the same as the organizer tote for Trunki! 
its ok 
Great for about 5 minutes 
Not suitable for a 2 year old 
Not suitable for grass 
For the price get a bubble mower.

A good starter project 
This is not a toy for the age group indicated 
Fun but no Transformation!!!! 
cute idea 
Not as good as Wilson and Brewster.

Really not for younger kids at all - unless you like work 
wish it was slightly bigger 
Great thought - but someone didn't think it all the way through. 
An OK case...but rather small 
Not what I expected. 
Ideal for discriminating younger Jedi 
Lightweight pretty but no substance 
Decent Starter Set

Battery drainer 
Hardly educational with expensive cartridges and pathetic apps 
Only OK 
screen damaged after three days.  Eats up batteries like candy 
After the lines and pushing at the store to get a toy tablet 
Acceptable sleeves and way better than nothing 
Different but not better. 
As discribed 
Not made for a young child 
Okay but doesn't have last appeal 
Great Concept 
Great fun and hours of entertainment! 
Solid and fun if slightly less so than LeapPad 
Toss up between the InnoTab and LeapPad 
Just OK. 
Ready set...start adding! 
It's ok 
Some fun 
I prefer the original especially for 2 players

Our Product is not Like the Picture 
Great truck- but I got price gouged. 
Save your money just get the regular Uno instead 
Mind-numbing for adults but my little Angry Birds fan loves it 
OK but probably not going to win classic game status 
Good game for boys 
Simple card game. 
Cheaper than the other Cars toys we have 
Lower quality than the other characters in the line. 
ok 
It does what it is supposed to do but lacks in quality 
Not as well made as i thought

review 
Not what was advertised

Good for younger girls who don't mind the 'permanent dresses' 
Pretty

Can't change all her clothes 
Blocks don't all fit together well. 
So-so

fun to play with 
Small and cheap 
Fun game but small 
No shame in Original Zero

Cute idea but very messy 
Not an essential item for your budding artist 
It's functional but needs improvements 
It's nice to have a portable art easel but it needs some work 
Lots of stuff but just so-so jewelry 
Great for mobile skills 
Easy to use Photos don't morph well limited choices 
Great for classrooms - who use Crayola crayons 
Unknown yet 
Takes Too Long to Keep Kids Interested 
Fun if You Don't Expect Too Much in Advance 
Not as good as the original but fun 
Crayola has better products & crayons to choose from 
Needs Parents Help 
Eh 
Patience and Cleanup Required 
Pretty neat toy if it works properly. 
Okay but clean up is an issue 
too much work too little result 
Picture overpromises what the item does. 
Not Crayola's best option 
Not for every kid 
Rated \Good\ by kids ages 6 & up. 
Better for younger children perhaps? 
Not great for a four year old 
So-so 
Fun Characters from the movie. 
Wish the wheels really rolled!

Kids like it but educational value is not as good as it should be. 
Nice but 
SKIP THIS 
Expensive apps stylus based short battery life yet entertaining 
Not bad but not worth all the hype... 
Beware if you plan to buy this and don't live in the US

Good and yet annoying. 
It's alright 
Not worth it for my child 
Cute 
Ok but not worth the money 
It's ok But Interest is lost quickly 
Not worth more than 10 bucks Max 
Not the best in the D-Arts Mega Man line 
Didn't hold her interest long 
Barely adequate 
Best for indoor ---- think hall/gymnasium ---- use. 
Kids like them and they're pretty neat to watch but that's all you do
