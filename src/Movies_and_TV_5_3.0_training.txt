Good but not as moving 
Winkler's Performance was ok at best! 
Christmas 
Didn't finish watching it 
Just ok 
American Christmas Carol. Henry Winkler 
An interesting contrast to more traditional versions 
A foible adaptation but not without merit 
Made to look old 
twist 
FONZIE PLAYS SCROOGE....AAAYYYYYY!!!! 
A little too sensual for us to keep this one. 
1 Christmas classic and 1 Christmas dud 
Not a Smash But Still Notably Significant 
Too heavy handed for young children 
The original claymation Little Drummer Boy 
Hilarious. Should be MST3k'd 
Not The Best of Rankin Bass 
Santa Claus is coming to town 
Historic classic but not the greatest Christmas special. 
They don't make Christmas films like this anymore

Sliced and Diced 
Not that Great

A gift 
What does the atonement mean? 
3.5 
By Turns Beautiful and Frustrating 
The Good & Bad Of 'The Passion Of The Christ' 
\King Of Kings\ with lots of red paint 
A Good Movie NOT a Life-Altering Experience 
Powerful Haunting yet a Disappointing Agenda 
This movie reflects religion in today's political climate 
Melleus Meleficarum 
Once but probably not again 
Visually compelling... but for what reasons? 
Problematic At Best 
Overly violent recounting of the passion 
Long Bloody  - Too Violent 
A worthy cinematographic work 
The problem with Gibson's passion 
Powerfully Moving Emotional Driven Film 
I&#65533;m Not Sure I Understand WHY Mel Gibson Made This Movie 
A movie every religious wacko and anti-semite will love! 
Style but no substance 
Bravo to Jim Caviezel. 
Death without Life 
INRI -- \I'm Nailed Right In\ 
Prefered the Life of Brian 
A Fair and Balanced Look at a Controversial Epic 
B- 
Strange Bloody Enduring... 
Too Violent 
too violent! But good depiction 
A alternate title might have been \ Let's Torture Jesus To 
A depiction but not a drama 
The Passion Is An Extraordinary Film 
Crucifixion lacked context 
On Passion and Violence 
A moving film but very innacurate and needdesly gory 
Good but could of been better. 
Not about the movie - About Amazon 
A Bit of the Old Ultra Violence 
Sould have left well enough alone... 
Great Authenticity but Excessive Gore 
Intensity not inspiration. 
Blood blood and more blood... 
I'm sorry Mel 1-star for violence 5-stars for good intentions 
One Opinion... Not as Good as \Last Temptation of Christ\ 
Good - not great 
You'll Either Love It or You'll Fall Asleep. 
A Movie You Should See But Not Spiritually Moving 
People Applauded This Film When It Ended 
So much potential squandered... 
I Was Left Wondering Who Was Whom 
An honorable 3 Stars! 
Much talked about...

Red Meat 
This movie was about torture 
As Pornographic as it gets

THE REALITY OF WHAT JESUS REALLY SUFFERED FOR Mankind TO BE FORGIVEN of Their sins 
Compelling ..................... 
passion of christ 
The Passion's Sad Story 
Flawed But Compelling Trip Down the Via Dolorosa 
Not Quite the Religious Experience I was Expecting ... 
GOOD MYTHOLOGY!!!!!!!!! 
passion of Christ 
ACCURACY IS ONE THING SHRILL OVERKILL QUITE ANOTHER 
\the beating of the Christ\ 
Not perfect but worth a viewing... 
(3.5 stars) Good Flawed Film 
Jesus goes through pain then gets leg-hairs torn out. 
See the film the bigots and commissars did not want you to see 
Its okay 
mediocre unnecessary graphic violence 
Unbiased review 
Inspiration not accuracy is this story 
Lethal Whippin' 
Brutal Biblical Epic! 
It's only Mel's vision.

Has the vibe of a hospital soap opera 
Interesting Information 
Helpful 
Excellent Classic 
George Must Have Enjoyed This Himself. 
It won't blow your mind. 
gets it partially right;  therefore suspect 
Missing any WOW factor 
definitely not my favorite 
Good effort but somewhat disappointing. 
Words Cannot Express 
Sincere effort but a bit over the top performance by Bruce 
Another view's Impact 
At first I really liked it 
Better 
I love Joe and Eric. Steve Vai was a mess. 
Good playing; sets were too fragmented; sound problems

IN SEARCH OF WOODY ALLEN 
Not his best but not his worse... 
Early Woody as a Career Bank Robber Has Some Funny Sight Gags But It Just Drifts 
Only 3 Stars for bad item description 
He had better days ahead but this is what put Woody on the map 
woody is always good 
In the beginning Woody created a schlock mockumentary 
Favorite Woody Allen movie from a person that is not a big fan of Woody Allen

A few things you should know about 'Tenebre' 
visually interesting 
Not Argento's best 
More horror-art from the Italian master of gore. 
Average Argento 
Argento 
3.75 STARS: A very good suspense-thriller/horror hybrid with impressively graphic kills. 
Great score by Goblin 
Everything You'd Expect in an Argento Film! 
Not Argento's Best But Stil Quite Fun 
visually well done but hurting in other places 
Dario Argento And Tony Franciosa Create Knife-Wielding Terror

Intersting - good performances 
The car 
look both ways before crossing the road 
OK horror movie from the 1970s. 
Enjoyable...an \Invocation of Destruction\ that is pretty light but nonetheless interesting... 
Running on Empty... 
LOW BUDGET WITH SOME GOOD MOMENTS BUT........! 2 1/2 STARS! 
Fun cheesy 70's horror flick 
A highlight of seventies cheese. 
The horror film that was more silly than scary 
Long version of short story 
Great Santa; Scary Angel; Mediocre Script! 
Jeez remember when Disney made movies like this? 
Magic Christmas 
Not your usual Disney fare 
Dark

Old suspens 
Overall pretty good with a frightening middle segment. 
AN EYE FOR AN EYE 
Original and eerie 
A little like a trip to another dimension 
Very short and not entertaining but gets the point across 
Not Worth It 
Short & too descriptive 
A surprise 
Beware the title 
Three Homes of the Architect 
Jury still out on this one 
Upstairs Downstars the 2011 remake 
Similar to Downton Abbey 
Sorry to see USDS will not have a third season

Pretty good show 
A Bit too Slow. 
Was Expecting Downton 
Not bad 
Not a Downton Abbey 
Difficult  movie. 
Downton Abbey Lite 
Upstairs downstairs 
More research. 
Upstairs Downstairs 
Enjoyable but sadly not any good. 
Great Programme - Shame about the DVD quality 
its o.k. 
A Fitting -- If Creatively Inferior -- Reboot 
I thought it was a slow start... 
tries too hard but I still enjoyed watching it 
Crammed too much in 
A Weak Attempt to revive the Original Series 
LOOKING BACK 
Not As Good 
Was alright 
Disjointed but Okay 
Not as good as original 
High Class - Low Tech 
Three Hours -- too short a time to develop the story 
Upstairs Downstairs 
I didn't hate it but didn't love it ~ it's just... okay 
After already watching Downton Abbey it seems like a clone before the fact 
Not up to par 
Dated bt enjoyable 
informative show 
Not The Best 
A disappointing production 
Not the Best Version...Not the Worst 
Pretty Dark Story in Book or Movie Form 
Different take on Jane Eyre 
Disappointing

Not quite Miss Jane's Emma 
This Emma Deserves a Better DVD Release 
Good adaptation 
Not bad but the vicar is better looking than Knightly ! 
3 maybe 3 1/2 
good version 
It could be so good... 
Emma - miss matchmaker 
Decent adaptation... 
Not as Likeable 
Too Dark 
Emma oh so many versions 
Not as good as EMMA starring Gwyneth Paltrow 
To Sender 
Ho Hum 
Kate Beckinsale's Emma 
not my favorite version 
Pleasant. Relaxed-pace ok once. 
True to novel but awful quality 
Nice series but it left me with many questions 
Zooming back and forth 
If you like outer space you'll probably enjoy it. 
Interesting but 
Informative 
crossed over the line 
Impressive and entertaining with some creative license 
The Crossing 
Crossing 
It doesn't have English subtitle 
It doesn't have English subtitle 
Great Blunders of WW II is a Blunder 
Percy? Give me more of Shove Along! 
Decent on its own merits way-out as an adaptation 
3.5 stars a grand attempt but lacking. 
It all Depends on how you Look at It 
Dull and esoteric 
A unique approach to Civil War documentary 
New Poirot not up to earlier efforts 
Half good half aggravating 
Didn't Want It To End 
Definitely NOT a Downton Abbey production... 
warning:  watch it soon after purchasing 
Upstairs Downstairs 
Wait 
Just a matter of personal likes/dislikes. 
Overpriced and overated ...... Viewer should expect more.... 
the producers of this set... 
Issues with a couple discs

What's with the release date? 
Simitar DVD 
A more child-friendly film. 
A Classic &quot;Godzilla&quot; but tends to drag 
Nice recovery after the whole &quot;Kong&quot; incident. 
GOOD ENTRY IN THE SERIES BETTER TREATMENT FOR FILMS 
A girl's movie 
The egg and Godzilla!

Not as.... 
Slightly disappointing all round

The memory was better than the video 
ILLEGAL ALIEN PR 
Where's the Blu-ray case? 
Movie: 3/5 Picture Quality: 4/5 Sound Quality: 4/5 Extras: 4.5/5 
Overrated.  But then you knew that or refuse to believe it.

A future that nobody wants 
Pretty Good Flick 
I love this movie but.... 
Hours of boredom tedium and unpleasantness 
Aye caramba it's long! 
Disappointing blu-ray visuals... 
If you are into U BOATS it's worth watching 
Kind of long but realistic 
Very realistic experience - very true to life 
Great Movie Unworthy DVD

Anaconda 
This river's a dangerous place Anaconda a big snake lives there... 
Chuckles Galore

Jennifer Lopez 
Odd start for a girl's movie career 
Professional Killer 
Professional at Times Disturbing at Times 
Please NO GIFTS from Matilda for me! 
Watchout - Violent movie w/ Hints of Perversity. 
Worth it but only for Oldman 
A good but fatally flawed action film. 
Mixed feelings about the Uncut International Version. . . 
Revenge: OK or a next menthal disorder? 
How is this better than Man on Fire? 
The Professional 
There's a lot missing here... 
Hitman and survivor join forces - not an action movie

Good story. 
MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING blu-ray 14/13  Alexander S Carter 
Keanu should stop acting 
Great Shakespeare but not a great movie. 
It's OK if you like Shakespeare 
A modern twist 
Good... 
Suceeds mainly as a popularization 
Good 
REVIEWING THE MOVIE DIRECTED BY KENNETH BRANAGH- MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING 
Much Ado About Nothing 
A lush but flawed production 
A good start to Shakespeare 
Double trouble. 
somewhere else 
White supremacy... 
Single White Female 
Good late night movie 
The Price is Right 
Generic horror/thriller 
Dark and gritty 
SWF means Sexy Whacked out Females in this case 
Roomate from hell 
The Roommate From Hell 
Thriller still thrills though the plot now feels a bit aged 
weird blend of action comedy 
ok 
Trailer was the movie. 
Twisty fun actually! 
&quot;3 stars is really being too kind&quot; 
\The difference between you & me is I make this look good\ 
It was o.k. 
Entertaining but &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; it ain't. 
So about these \Mastered in 4K\ blu-ray discs 
It's OK 
The bugs are great 
Some stories are timeless. 
This time the Nazi win 
Trashy fun in deep space... 
Takes bug wars to a new level 
Campy Sci-Fi Action Caper 
A pail reflection of the book 
Forget the book Verhoeven did!! 
Like pizza. 
Misunderstood by many.... 
Based upon the back cover of a novel by Robert Heinlein 
Starless  Troopers 
Fascists vs. bugs 
No Metaphore! BUGS!!!! 
Does Not Do The Book Justice 
Stupid but what a great shower scene 
Great Movie but the DVD itself kills it 
Very good DVD technically but a brainless movie 
Very Violent Satire 
Starship: Small Suprise 
Who wants to kill some bugs! 
A subtle satire of the novel 
Worse every time I see it 
Eh... 
Satirical. But still not that great. 
Good but not a &quot;classic&quot; 
Fairly good movie 
A movie for a boring day with nothing else better to do. 
PURE PULP FUN 
I bought to here the rifftrax mp3 
THE BUGS ARE COMING.......??? 
Entertaining sarcastic yarn. 
Workmanlike but weird 
Has its moments but doesn't really deserve the title 
Quite a smart movie for a blockbuster 
ANOTHER ROMANTIC COMEDY 
Some scenes are charming but Julia is not Kate HEPBURN... 
Good romantic comedy! 
Disappointingly &quot;un-quirky&quot; 
A fun light-hearted comedy 
Not My Best Friend 
An okay movie but not a Julia Roberts best. 
Don't be BFFS with an ex it's crazy 
Julia Roberts does it again 
Somewhat disappointing but maintains interest. 
Rupert Everett is the main attraction 
I give it a B... 
Reliable Classic Chick Flick 
My Best Friend's Wedding 
Different but not especially good 
your expectations maybe crushed 
Julia Roberts....is evil? 
MAWKISH SITCOM WITH A BOUQUET OF RANDOM WARBLINGS 
Pretty decent for a chick flick 
Just okay 
Romantic movie 
Stupid story at times but it's funny and the charactors hve chemestry 
MORE SUZANNE SNYDER 
Predictable but well done anyway 
Feel-Good Romance With a Sensual Salma Hayek 
PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT NOT VERY FUNNY OR ROMANTIC! 
silver dollars in the Hoover Dam? 
Didn't Quite Live Up to My Expectation.... 
I would actually give it a 3 1/2 
SOCIAL PLACE AND REPRESSION 
Movies Like This Create Anxiety for Me 
by no means a masterpiece 
Nothing happens but good acting and photography 
The Remains of the Day 
Wake me up when it's over. 
Polite And Diplomatic...... 
Exposing one-night stands and psychological burnout ... will surprise viewers 
Transgenders: More than meets the eye! 
Lovely sets good acting ... sad commentary 
Touching rendering of a family dealing with their transgendered child 
a weak storyline if there ever was one 
boring 
Kind of fun...del Toro looks great! 
Not Even An Aaron Sorkin Re-Write Can Give This Film An 'Excess' Of Wit Or Energy 
Is it a bird is it a plane? no it's THE PRESIDENT ? 
It was All Right. 
High Flying Fun! 
Interesting but . . . 
A fun movie with some great performances 
What would they have called the sequel? 
The Whispering President. 
Overly simplistic and far fetched 
Harrison Ford's Got My Vote... 
It's 5 stars or 1 depending on... 
Solidly mediocre film 
Felt like it was never going to end 
Die Hard Remake!!!!!!!!! 
Mr Kick-[butt]...  President 
Fairly typical techno-thriller one of Ford's better late efforts 
Once upon a time.... 
Petersen builds the challenge with nice sequences... 
A Good Action Movie However... 
This Film Is Not In Widescreen! 
OH NO! It's Van Damme and Rodman. 
Same ole plot just worse 
Personal Foul - Dennis Rodman 
Formula plot terrific set-pieces 
\You look like a carrot with earrings\ 
An average slam dunk for Van Damme 
Not Topnotch but still Fun 
Van Damme goodRodman stop the torture... 
THE ACTING IS HORRIBLE 
Harmless family comedy 
Talking pheotus.  11th may 2004. 
\Yeah lunch!\ 
Awesome movie limited format. 
Kids Say the Darndest Things! 
Sally Field = *VOMIT*. 
A mildly pleasant way to spend an evening 
Thoughtful riposte to \investigative journalists\ 
Absence of Love Interest 
Good performances...ethics be damned 
Concert not a Music Video 
I Feel Guilty Giving It Less Than 5 Stars But... 
Confusing didnt develop well. 
Welcome to To the Sixth Element 
Humor sci-fi 
Could Have Been Great! 
Dumb but entertaining... 
A bit too silly 
Good 
Stick to your old DVD ! 
Why Not Add a 2nd Special Features Disc w/the Superbit? 
Glossy sci-fi 
Spaceballs! 
A premise played to quite an extreme 
No gene for the human spirit (or apparently not for emotion) 
Interesting Conceit Falls a Bit Short 
Mildly entertaining plot ultimately dull movie. 
5 Stars if new to sci-fi - 1 star if you know sci-fi 
I may trade mine for non-superbit 
Okay but not great 
Interesting Perspective 
the more I thought about it the less I liked it 
Dark heavy and slow 
Clever story but does tend to drag 
Genetically imperfect hero against DNA-based Apartheid 
An unforgettable vision of the future when all humans are snardy twitlings 
Gattaca 
Enjoy allegories 
Gattaca  (1997) 
A J. Lo. Movie 
Odd very odd but good.......I guess 
I didn't find this movie great but worth watching 
Jennifer Lopez in \U Turn\ 
U bomb 
IT deserved less but... 
On second thought... 
It tries too hard to be a better film than it is... 
Seven Year Itch 
Long on scenery.  Short on plot tension. 
Brilliant vistas and cinematography yet draggy at times. 
Semi-interesting. 
Brad Pitt is impossible. 
Respectful visually stunning tribute to Tibetan culture 
Not bad--some beautiful scenes good acting. 
Where lies the truth? 
'Seven Years in Tibet' (1997): Review 
A tad on the bland side 
Real Carlos has Brown Eyes Imposter has Blue Eyes 
AMUSING 
okay 
A rather insipid take on a somewhat engaging subject... 
Very Underrated 
You know how when you make a copy of a copy it's not as sharp as... well... the original 
FUN 
I'm a Michael Keaton fan but 
Multiplicity - \It's OK\ 
Keaton and His Clones Deliver 
Too Cute 
Finding a Serial Murderer 
Where's the Pittsburghese? 
cool 
A little above average thriller 
A GOOD ACTION THRILLER ! 
Enjoyable But Lazy 
Fan of the film subpar Blu product 
Minimal Care Taken in Blu-ray Transfer 
Ok but better left alone 
Sweet movie 
Funny and Sad love story 
great movie 
Cute movie with great Dan Aykroyd lines and Jon Brant's band Siren on Soundtrack! 
Poorly Written 
His Twilight Zone 
Would Be 5 Stars If The Film Was Complete! 
\Do you know why I talk so funny? Because I've been hit a million times.\ 
Great movie but get the VHS \Playhouse 90\ original version instead. 
Daddy's Little Girl Outwits a Rival 
Absolutely nothing new... 
Another study in a teenage girl's destructive dislike for her widowed father's lover... 
'Whoops'

Stupid But In A Way It Is Fun 
fab 5 vs fab 4

Above Average 
Worth seeing for Brando's performance but not much else 
Cute movie full of inside jokes for Godfather fans. 
One of Brando's last great performances 
Blu-ray:  The film deserves 4 stars but the presentation on Blu-ray and lack of features brings it down to 3 stars. 
The Probability Seems Rather Low. 
From fact to flatline fiction 
ENTERTAINING BUT NOT A COMPLETE WINNER!

An Okay Version of a Great Novel 
Les Miserables 
You think you know but you have no idea.
