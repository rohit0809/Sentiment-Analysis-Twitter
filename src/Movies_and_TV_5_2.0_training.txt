Disappointment 
To Nail or not to nail 
The Book Was Better 
If a two hour Jesus lynching is what you want here you have it. 
Tedious rendition of the Passion story. 
Just not a very good movie 
Theologically impoverished but an amazing spectacle 
MTV  or Buffy the Vampire Slayer version of the crucifixion 
grusome 
Violence & Religion 
Gibson's grievous fault 
Not worth the controversy 
The Gospel According to Mel 
Defective DVD and a vacuous film 
A sick gorefest

I get knocked down! But I get up again! You're never gonna 
WOWLook At All That Blood! (He really died on the cross?) 
Too graphic to Christians...! 
Highly Anti-Simitic 
Deserves an NC-17

This is a movie we're talking about right? 
FOR CHRISTIANS ONLY 
Most Unrealistic Version of Jesus' Life I've Ever Seen

Unnecessarily violent and was missing the whole point that is LOVE

Overrated! 
DIE HARD WITH A PASSION 
Who is the real Gibson? 
one incredible scene 
Where's the message? 
GIVE ME A BREAK 
I walked out of the theatre 
It could and would have been very powerful... 
Pointlessly grotesque and one-dimensional.

I was very disappointed. 
ABC VIDEO took the money and uhhhh... 
Unintended Side Effects 
Was ok

Waiting for a director 
Bad geography 
Historical Hammer Hilarity or something to that effect! 
Midnight Madness 
Meh If Your in the Mood 
Horrors fans only 
Bizarre and haphazard Argento's clumsy storytelling advances at a painfully slow pace until the bonkers finale. 
Stalking Killer Leaves Bug Trail... 
hi-ho hi-ho it's back to &quot;Suspiria&quot; we go... 
Unsettling quirky and peculiarly charming but not good 
Sorry Dario this one stank

Great gore effects but otherwise unremarkable zombie fare 
Awesomely gruesome but trashy. 
at least i can say i finally saw it... 
only watch if you love gore and blood

Completely overrated hack-job 
Demonic House of Cards 
Dude..that zombie has sharp teeth!!!

One DARK Christmas movie! 
So depressing 
Disappointing 
not that great but not as bad as others said 
Anguish?  Yeah that's about what I was feeling while watching this 
Good premise goes to waste. 
Not for older potty-trainers

Poor vidio 
Contrived 
Not like Downton

Bad copy 
Very Disappointing! Sequel!! 
predictable 
Eh it's ok 
You can't go home to Eaton Place again! 
A Lot of Drama 
Sub Par 
too old for me 
Upstairs Downstairs should be dropped to the dungeon 
Not what I expected 
No captions on Upstairs Downstairs prime 
a bit cheesy 
It's Okay If You Don't Love the Book 
The book's Jane Eyre - Not so much 
I just can't like this version. 
Ridiculous Rochester 
Fierce Creature 
Disappointing Version Of A Classic Love Story/Suspense Thriller. Grossly Overacted By Ciaran Hinds. 
How could any Jane Eyre fan love this movie??!! 
Definitely the Worst of the TV/Movie Adaptions 
Nice acting but why didn't they use the book? 
Not the Jane Eyre Movie I was looking for 
Good  - but shop around 
Not bad for a movie but try one of the mini-series 
A huge disappointment 
A truncated cheap Jane Eyre 
Mr. Rochester AKA Austin Powers.................. 
Sad 
DISAPPOINTING 
Hardy kills another romance novel 
A proper treatment for this show is WAY overdue...

Does not YET know kung-fu 
Great intentions... poor execution 
Watchable goofiness... 
The Future Looks Disappointing... 
Has Its Moments but Mostly a Mess of Bad Directorial or Perhaps Bad Editing Decisions. 
Countermeasures 
Keanu Reeves is likable almost always but this isn't even as good as 'Plughead Rewired: Circuitry Man II' 
I know it's fiction but the plot connections still need to be logical! 
I Think My Hard Drive Was Too Big To Take This Movie Seriously 
ALMOST AS BAD AS &quot;EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES!&quot; 
Give it the Boot - See the original not the derivative version 
Director's Cut -- just doesn't cut it 
Das booring das real real booring

Preposterous Story 
A Tasteless Film With Very Strong Pedophilic Undertones 
too violent 
A bland meal 
Naptime 
Unoriginal 
I must be getting old because it seems like I've seen better film on my own teeth 
True but Sad Movie.

Terrible 
Great Video and Audio.  Needs Flash Drive Which is Bad 
big disappointment 
Simple minded 
Movie does not do justice to the book

Decend 1st act 2nd act howlers and an unintentionally hilarious ending 
Doesn't measure up to potential 
Mediocre sci-fi 
Way too many stereotypes... 
Kenneth Branagh is not Francis Ford Coppola... 
Recommend the 2004 Hallmark adaptation instead -- more loyal and accurate

Disappointing 'Modern' Version of the Frankenstein Story! 
Very disapointed 
Overwrought &amp; Flat Attempt at Horror

What's To Like? 
Sometimes More is Too Much 
Couldn't get through it

Hush Hush Sweet Gwyneth 
The edited version - explained 
Not for 80's fans! 
Horrible edits destroy a beloved classic special. 
Ultimately For Lesibians Only 
Few scenes are worth watching.

NOTHING TO SAVE EXCEPT THE CROCODILES ! 
Could have been... 
1/2 Good Actors 1/2 Bad Actresses 
Surprise Ending

So bad it could be used for shark repellent 
Decent Kaiju - But Not \The\ Godzilla 
Not a Disaster but it Comes VERY Close. 
Little Lizard No Beast!

A Leo Movie 
Disappointing 
Fun for a while 
Aw C'mon 
A poor example of the revenge genre 
Ruined the original 
Director's Cut is not good 
GOOD CHEMISTRY & CINEMATOGRAPHY WASTED ON INSIPID 'PLOT' 
Unforgivable (Tony Scott's edit that is) 
The Seventh Sign
