It worked... a bit 
funky errors and frusterating camera angles 
Too Addicting 
The Best Game Beta Ever Released as a Retail Product 
God-like Micromanagement 
Tedious and Slow 
Black the game overall is bad: White it starts out good 
Over-rated and over-hyped. Buy THE SIMS instead.

EA Production Staff should be ashamed! 
Yawn. 
Beautiful to look at not much to play at
