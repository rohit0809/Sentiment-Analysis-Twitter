Decent while they worked! 
No color difference from stock bulb 
Color is too yellow 
Brighter than OEM. but doesn't last. 
Average

An Improvement But Nothing To Write Home About 
Brighter...I guess 
brighter than stock.  Not brightest of all. 
No brighter than OEM bulbs

Only for Particular OE Brackets 
Fit is not universal 
Not exactly fully automatic 
Not a spray sealant but okay for cleaning. 
Way over priced for the quantity.

Does okay but will keep looking 
Maybe I'm not using it correctly 
Too soon to tell 
Ok brush. Wish it was a bit stiffer. 
It's okay....

Good blade Bulky adapter 
Needs duct tape to hold it together. 
Good design nothing extraordinary or special though 
Works fine but nothing special. Costs too much I think. 
Works well but kinda ugly 
It's a wiper blade 
Mediocre- Middle of the Road Wiper Blade

Initially disappointed in the build... 
Decent Hardware but Software Lacking 
Good for high tech mechs if you need one for around the house better alternatives are around .** Company response in comments 
Confusing menus poor instructions Windows and subscription required for advanced features 
Mid-Quality

Details Matter 
Disappointed

Diamond Plate Chrome Motorcycle Cup Holder 
The Jury is Still Out 
Griots Garage 6 inch Random Orbital 
They are bright they fit in the socket they are designed for.  Some of mine had bad LEDs.  Order extra if you buy. 
fair 
It did help but it was a little on the small side 
Not a bargain becomes soft in high heat 
One roll is not enough 
More of a Project than I Anticipated 
The size of this product limits its application 
Works As Advertised But Can Be Costly 
A lot of work for only a small difference you will need many rolls to do a entire vehicle 
Doesn't seem to make a huge difference 
Works fine but is too small for most applications 
Sometimes It's Best To Use A Professional 
Not enough to do much with 
Sound Reduction 
Fitment was hard 
Works fine. 
Very soft but the border. 
Better than using an old tee shirt

Too  much rain to give a full review but not bad so far! 
Not what I hoped 
Work pretty good 
Sponges wrapped in microfiber. 
Good deal grabby feel 
Installation Trickery if you already have DRL 
Sylvania led Driving Pipe DRL/Accent light kit 
This is not what you think it is... Not for the DIY for sure! 
I think a good coating of wax would work just as well ... 
3.5 Stars Good Protection But Difficult To Apply 
Needs precise application cures/dries with rough surface and very difficult to remove 
Clear instructions  be sure to prep first 
Peels off within a week 
For good results leave the application to a professional 
Not for used cars 
More Of A Professional Product 
Wait until spring if you don't have a garage.

Awkward but effective 
Not what I would classify as \Ultra Thick\ 
Too much to deal with 
Good for tracking locations. Does not sync all drive activity. 
Has Potential But Its Current Iteration Offers Limited Usefulness 
Great idea 
Nice start; needs some improvements to be truly useful; mpg was way off which is a problem 
Has Some Usefulness But Be Aware of Limitations 
Great concept decent execution.  Wears down phone battery quite a bit though. 
Great idea not quite there yet however 
Too big and bulky for me 
No raised edge to catch water runoff... 
Annual Fee makes this a no-go 
Initial activation woes. Serious privacy concerns. But I kinda like it. 
I don't really see any value in it 
Great for spying on your teenage drivers - but that's about it 
Easy to Use but SERIOUS Privacy Issues 
Clearly good at what it's supposed to do 
Not \new car\ fragrance but effective 
DUB Tire Shine.. It's Okay. 
Do you like Pi&ntilde;a Caliente? Do you like getting caught in the rain...? 
Smells really bad 
Seems to work alright but hard to compare versus other cleaners

Well made but doesn't add much to the car 
Bright but with some flaws 
Good for some people not for others 
Does What it Promises but Size is a Limitation 
works but has limitations you may not want to compromise for 
It's ok fo the money?
