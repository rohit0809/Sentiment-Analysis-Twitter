Not My Cup of Energy 
Caffeinated vitamin drink?  Oxymoron? 
Ruins perfectly good water 
Great idea but taste is off 
Not Really Worth It 
Ingredients scare me 
Akin to squeezable koolaid.. 
A shoddy bottle design and meh taste kill off its appeal 
Better Than Mio But Not Very Tasty

Caution: not for children (or maybe adults) 
Between plain water and soda 
Room for improvement. 
Vitamin Taste 
We didn't like the taste 
A Product Without a Need 
Unnatural & Artificial 
Nice taste lasting energy but gives me a lasting headache.

Tastes okay but.... 
Hmm. 
Sounded great in concept - in real life - too many competing flavors for any of it to taste wonderful 
I have no idea what to do with it! 
Nearly Impossible to Spread 
Way too sweet! 
Not for me 
If you're into chunky candy sandwiches this one's for you; too indiscriminately sweet & difficult to spread on bread/crackers 
Too much of a good thing? 
Lose the white chocolate at least. 
WEIRD. 
Peanut Butter Polygamy :>)

Good taste but fatally flawed 
Could be OK if not for the artificial sweetener and flavors 
Too Sweet wish they left out the Sucralose 
It's not as natural as Lipton advertises 
Sucralose Inside! 
More Tea Than Lemonade...Let Alone Berries 
Simultaneously bland and artificial tasting 
Sucralose was a little too overpowering for my taste 
Why Lipton why sure it tastes fine but artificial sweetner? 
Disappointed 
Very artificial 
Yes I prefer brewed iced tea but this just tastes nasty 
Bad taste 
Iced - Not so hot 
Good Coconut Flavor but Artificial Sweetener Aftertaste

Eh 
Not the greatest 
It's okay...

I'm going to go with \Yuck\. 
Yet Another High Fructose Corn Syrup Snack 
Blah 
If it wasn't free I probably would return it 
nice texture but flavor and ingredients seem like graduating from pop-tarts 
Poor Ingredients Ruin A Good Tasting Product 
Unappealing ingredients and flavor 
Healthy snack? Think again.

Good crunch short on flavor 
Not what I expected 
Barely edible would not try again 
It left a hollow taste in my mouth. 
Will not buy it

like drinking wilted flowers 
Not Suited To Robust Flavor Preferences 
Disappointingly lacking in flavor... 
Large on scent - very weak on flavor 
Not awful but now I know why these were on sale. 
Hard as a Brick.  Otherwise What's not to Love? 
Simple reality

I'll get my caffeine elsewhere 
Whew not my choice of flavors.

Unfortunately it is just not sweet enough - aftertaste is unpleasant 
Not sugar-free 
After taste not sweet enough 
Just another artticial sweetener 
Marketing trumps Product Value 
Sugar + Molasses 
Buy 100% Erythritol Instead 
Your Mileage May Vary... 
Stevia In The Raw is better 
has an odd taste; I prefer Splenda 
Another Artificial Sweetener Option for Some 
Misleading and not what you think

If you like really sweet stuff... 
Meager!  We'd rather go hungry than snack on these 
El Dud-o's 
Disapointing 
A notch below generic lemon filling cookies. 
Where is the filling?!?! 
Boring Cookie... 
Pretty Cookies Disappointing Taste 
Where's the lemon? 
Very light coconut flavor and texture

Disappointing 
Not Much Coconut Flavor 
Not Our Favorite 
We were so disappointed we didn't even finish the cup. 
Too sweet overpackaged 
Good snack size but they taste waxy and artificial 
Not the best

Forgettable

Gummie-like candy with corn syrup and sugar as the first two ingredients ... where's the fruit? 
No strawberries were harmed in the making of this product 
Healthy Packaging Hiding Same Old Sugar 
20% Fruit (Sort of) and Not Vegetarian 
Poor packaging to food ratio 
Pretty \meh\ for a fruit snack 
A little disappointed in Kellogg's 
With a name like \Harvest Acres\ it should be organic.. 
There are better fruit-flavored snacks if they don't have to be strawberry 
There are better \natural\ fruit snacks on the market 
What's sweeter than any sweetener?  THESE! 
No berries were harmed in the making of these *fruit snacks 
Welch's and Target Marketplace fruit snacks are better 
Truffle Flavor Overwhelmed Cheddar 
Burnt flavor and bad taste 
Not sealed properly 
Cute packaging. Stale and bland taste 
Odd Mixture 
Sorry No 
Not for me..

Why trans fats on popcorn? 
Caramel and kettle were ok cheddar was squishy and oily. 
Not very good 
Surprising failure 
Healthier but it doesn't taste good 
very salty & taste like paper 
Where's The Butter? 
Popcorn bowl is a total bust - the old bags worked fine!  And it is way too salty 
Very dry with almost no butter flavor 
Disappointing

Try One Packet From The Store Before Buying In Bulk: Not Quite The Dark Chocolate Experience I Was Craving 
No consistent flavor 
Dry  coating is hard and overwhelms almond taste. 
Not A Fruity Guy (With Oreos Anyways) 
Tastes like watermelon bubblegum 
I love all the other kind bars 
Disappointing 
Yuck 
A Ho Hum Bar 
So so... 
Just so-so. 
Wouldn't crave this... 
Not impressed with quality or nutrition 
not my cup of tea

Very disappointing 
Too Little Chocolate Too Easily Broken Up 
Not worth the cost; puny portions 
Barilla gluten free rotini

Not my choice for Earl Gray 
Weird Taste Bad Combo?  Somethings missing... 
A mixed Bag  :(

Funny after taste unlike packets. 
Nothing special or different 
Good Though The Olive Oil Is A Bit Overwhelming 
Tasteless 
Yummy but VERY mild 
Can't recommend it 
too much oil 
Just Okay 
Not worth it 
too salty NO Omega-3 
A misleading way to sell oily tuna 
It may have Omega-3 but that's all 
Not Tasty 
dry low on Omega-3 
Overbearing flavorings not balanced or mild 
Artificial 
Had high hopes but... 
Not a fan... 
mild mint 
Okay but not a favorite 
Unfortunately \Light\ on Flavor and Taste 
Sub-par Coffee 
Was expecting a lot more very little taste or aroma. 
Good Flavor But Too Much Residue 
Not a fan 
Not for me or my friends 
Not an enjoyable cup of coffee sorry to say 
A Matter of Taste but not Good 
First few sips are fine.  Then ------ 
Give this a miss folks

Hard not a good consistency 
Not sure exactly what I was expecting but this wasn't it 
Bought directly from the company months ago... 
Bland 
Bland Soup Assortment 
Fair but better soups are available 
Strong unpleasant aftertaste 
I was so excited to get the real deal but.... 
Unpleasant taste note 
Hmmm.

Reminds me if Astronaut Ice Cream... 
Horrible aftertaste and pretty much sugar

Granddaughter had no luck with this 
The flavor seemed a little off 
OK but completely melted in the mail box 
Disappointing 
Worst Lindt I've had in a while. 
Not what I expected 
Meh not a fan 
Reese's these are not! 
Stick With the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups 
so-so texture so-so flavor and a lot of calories 
Taste was odd might want to avoid if you are lactose intolerant. 
Pales in Comparison

Off Taste 
Lid broke.  Smelly/profuse diapers. 
Sampler set = less than 3 cups of contents = $40? 
Not the best value for the price... 
12 bottles - curiously sweet balsamic vinegar blood orange syrup tasted like cough medicine 
Requires far too much to really be noticed 
Not worth the price 
Overpowering Sweetness As Opposed To Mango Flavor: Comparing Two Lipton Tea & Honey Liquids 
Contains Sucralose/Splenda

For those sensitive to sulfites ... Urgent Info 
Tea & Honey & Lies 
Love the syrup but.... 
Smooth non acidic but rather flavorless 
Dark Water 
Ok texture but really didn't like the taste. 
Dried out .... 
Would be Better if non-GMO! 
Ho Hum 
You can probably do better than this  . . . 
Sports Fan Seasoning doesn't score; prepare to hack cough and sneeze 
okay but the cheddar flavors are better 
Ok flavors but no one in my family thought there were wonderful or even that good 
Kind of tastes like movie theatre butter/oil but not quite as tasty 
Not very buttery without adding some real butter 
Pass 
Good oil for popping but as a topping no! 
Not Movie Theatre Butter 
Not for air-popped popcorn 
Not as awesome as I'd hoped 
Not impressed

All three flavors *taste* great HOWEVER... 
Mixed review 
Kind of funky 
Nacho Cheddar Seasoning 
Meh. Rather have the real thing. 
Forget About It...

Not very good 
Chalky Cheese

Clever box but not much else 
Accurately Reproduces the Taste of Office Coffee Unfortunately 
Not much coffee flavor at all. SUPER light roast...not terrible but not good 
It's a novelty item not a good coffee 
Not the best taste but - I'm not that sleazy 
Oh great they're combining flavor reviews again.... 
I like the packaging and the name... 
Sorry no Cigar for this one........ 
Not horrible but not great 
LET'S GET WEIRD FLAVOR: Not so good to me 
Do you really want your coffee roasted by a cable comedy channel? 
A failed experiment in my house 
Similar to canned vegetables 
A pretty expensive way to get a small amount of vegetables 
Good idea but so far this isn't for me. 
Half the box gone and I can sort of see the novelty... 
a waste. 
Doesn't taste like coconut 
Too weak for me
