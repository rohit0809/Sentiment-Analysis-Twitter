Not All It's Cracked Up To Be 
Ergonomics! Lacking Completely 
Good idea but doesn't work well in practice

You're better off with a separate grinder 
So many problems... 
Doesn't last 
Where do I start? 
Seriously awful; Glad to see I am not the only one who thought so! 
Burning smell

Cleans well but built on the cheap 
Chinsey piece of junk 
Buy the EXTENDED WARRANTY 
Cleans good hand tool sucks breaks easily 
Great short time steam cleaner not for the long haul 
Hoover SteamVac V2 
This cleaner is great....when it works! 
Cleans carpets well while it lasts - hand tools are a waste. 
Doesn't stay stuck on 
Terrible adhesives 
Size of the pressure cooker -  something is wrong !!! 
Didn't work for what I wanted 
You have to assemble handle etc. 
Breaks Easy 
going back to my george foreman

Functionally good 
Oh Dear Oh Dear Oh Dear.... 
Presto Hot Air Corn Popper 
I am sad 
Makes the popcorn chewy and stick to teeth 
Didn't work as I expected

I disagree 
Good for standard yellow popcorn--not other varieties 
Presto Popper Purchased in 2013 
No off button 
like eating chewy cardboard 
Gack! Popcorn comes out chewy

Not very good 
Avoid It...  Really 
Brita pitcher 
Great water flawed pitcher 
I changed my review from 5 Stars..buyer beware 
Makes no coffee half the time; only produces hot water 
Really wanted to love it 
Excessive grounds 
Great looking percolator but... 
Presto Coffee Maker 
Not your Mom's great old Percolator 
thought it would be time saving but its not .... 
It cut the carrots okay but not the vegetables I eat 
MUCH Smaller than it looks in the picture 
Buy a food processor instead 
missing parts and smaller than I thought it would be 
Should have more attachments for this price. 
Too complicated to switch between times 
Can we turn it off please? 
Not easy to use 
too confusing to use as a kitchen timer 
It was great while it worked. 
Meh 
Difficult to read the numbers on the face

Found cheaper at Walmart 
Not good 
Don't bother 
I think I got a bad one 
horrible 
Not like the old Castiron 
Doesn't work on a normal home stove 
Massive item. 
Food sticks every time. 
Great size but horrible heat distribution 
Stick (no pun intended) with the Original Lodge Pan !!! 
sticky little pan 
maybe I'm just doing it wrong 
Maybe cast iron is just not for me 
Rust issues with mine every time I use it. 
Hey there TINY skillet 
Never Got To Use It 
Non-stick? Please don't joke! 
Glad I bought it 
Pre-seasoning does not reduce sticking 
Eventually rusts 
Never got seasoned enough 
Not as seasoned as it needs to be for eggs 
Check the nutritional info and price 
Not quite as natural as I would like 
Rusted
