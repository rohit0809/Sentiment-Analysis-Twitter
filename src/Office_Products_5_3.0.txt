Decent 
It works 
You get what you pay for

Basic mouse pad perfect for basic use. 
Great price but for a few dollars more you can get better quality.

Epson  2200 Review 
Not the End-all Be-all Solution 
Functional....but pricey 
Undersize 
Good product nice price 
Good once it's in.  Can be messy to install due to printer. 
Requires special headset 
Sturdy and does its job well but takes up quite a bit of space 
Good idea; perhaps not good value. Challenges in use but broader applications than billed. 
Seems poor for the price 
Expected better ... at the MSRP 
Just OK 
Overpriced and probably overkill for most uses 
Too large and the elastic string that holds the pages down is flimsy 
Functional If A Little Unwieldy and Cumbersome 
Nice but some major flaws

Five Sets of thin white dividers and invisible peelable strips for easy customizing. 
I really want to like it - but this stand falls short 
A useful stand for taking notes on what you're reading 
Well made but not for thick books. 
A flaw to consider before buying 
Adequate bookstand 
Not very strong 
Works ok... 
thin 
It smells 
Mouse pad 
It is a mouse pad. 
Works Great But Smells Bad 
Does what it's supposed to do. 
It's oil. It lubricates but... 
Just OK 
Its oil.  It works the way oil should. 
One caveat 
Does it's job but a bit messy 
Good Price Works Well but Poorly Designed Bottle that Leaks 
Hmmmmmm 
The product itself is okay but figuring out how to open the bottle was a little tricky 
This really is just vegetable oil 
Gets the job done - that's about all it does 
Okay 
Large tray 
Works. 
Cuts very well.  Rulers not precise 
Great Feel When Cutting! 
Will it last? 
Decent cheap trimmer. 
Not Always Even Cut. But it is a decent Device 
going back to my old trimmer 
I Prefer the Rolling Cutters 
Cuts well but not the one to get if you need accuracy 
Look at the photo not the specs 
really little 
Lightweight & efficient

Flap too flimsy and easily bent 
Flimsy Flap

It's okay if you don't intend to over-fill it or open the flimsy flap umpteen times a day! 
Functional but flap is disappointing 
These are average 
Good 
These Wilson Jones Insertablet 8 Tab Dividers are for lightweight organizing but the price is right! 
Decent tab dividers but not particularly durable ... 
Nothing special 
Perfectedly Ordinary Tab Dividers 
For Occasional Use 
They work but are flimsy and cheap. 
Cheap and imperfect but they do separate pages 
Pretty Standard 
Not much to say...it fills the bill 
Just the basics 
Fine for light use but not for everyday heavy use. 
Mixed results 
Plastic dividers are just not as good as paper. 
Great idea - damaged in production 
They seemed fine 
Not very comfortable to sit on for very long 
It's so hard to sit on! 
Not for fixed-height chairs

Not my favorite ink pen but does the job 
Consistency is \iffy\ 
okay 
I Was Hoping For a Better Quality! 
I Do Not Like Gel Pens 
The point section is a bit \tall\ for my hand 
My wife loves it. 
Much more comfortable grip but the clip is easily bent 
YOU have to mount this one for effective sharpening 
It's nice  but construction is pretty cheap 
Better than the Boston KS 
Underwhelmed 
Almost as good

a little flimsy 
not very sturdy 
Liked the organizational features but not as sturdy as I'd like... 
NICE COLORS GOOD QUALITY.

The cost is a bit much 
Clear packing tape works just as well 
Doesn't stick very well 
Tape is good price is bad.

The School Standard 
Good but look cheap 
Worked for a While 
Average but inexpensive 
OK but not really used very much

There are better options that can do 20 sheets with the same staples. 
It's okay 
A Staple 
Pretty cheap 
Depends on Much Stapling You Will Be Doing 
Nice to have for extra stapler!

They work 
Why not scored into quarters? 
Word presets work fine but having problems with clipart and images 
Stylish label for specific printing jobs but prone to smudges 
Very nice looking labels but tricky to use 
Adds a nice accent 
Labels don't work as well as expected; not for black-ink printers 
Disappointed 
Good tape does what it's supposed to bad dispenser 
It sure is super strength and they ain't fooling around! 
Super strong tape horrible dispenser! 
Think of it as heavy-duty office tape 
OK for medium duty work 
I wouldn't buy again 
OK BUT 
Interesting idea imperfect implementation

Decent binder loose plastic back 
Unimpressive 
Average binder 
Standard three ring binder with all the basic drawbacks.

Eco-friendly view binder is otherwise ordinary 
Standard Binder 
A Basic Round Ring Binder But The Covering Is Too Loose 
Expensive for a basic binder 
Should work well enough for me. 
Seriously? $9 for this? Not all that impressive. 
Does the job but needs some work. 
Almost made it through a semester... 
Basic 1 1/2 inch binder. 
Board Awesome Hangars and Accessories Not So Much 
I suggest 3 changes 
Decent 
Three Stars 
At least the tape stays where it should. 
OK ONLY... Dispenser 
It's okay but the At-A-Glance products are much better 
Good Style But A Little Off 
Large Thin paper. 
Better products exist but this looks nice 
Wide-Ruled? Is this business notes for third graders? 
Nice Page Layout --But Low Quality Paper 
Functionality depends on how you plan to use it and the type of writing instrument you use 
it's okay and pretty generic 
Well.... 
not worth the extra expense to me 
good product 
Pretty close to perfect but... 
Great printer but I don't understand the price. 
Great Idea Hard To Use! 
One big sticker gives lots of freedom to design but a little unwieldy to shape 
An Oaky Budget Option but Print Quality Suffers 
BEWARE - This is a \Compatible\ product 
As advertised 
OK Little Printer 
Compared to what? 
Good value. 
As expected but that clear. 
Ony 5 cartridges not 6 
It is EVERYDAY paper after all

Works but not great 
A Diamond Set in Cheap Plastic 
Washable eradicable blue ink. 
It did what it was supposed to. 
A Good Product but a Bad Idea. 
Will work more or less-depending on your phone 
Well-constructed but has limited usefulness 
For the right job it'll do... 
Fair But Not Quite What I'd Hoped For 
That Lack of Top Flap Is Not Actually A Good Thing... 
Not bad 
cardboard expanding file 
Ordinary stapler 
Not as Heavy Duty Given the Special Staples Needed 
Unfortunately they don't make them like they used to. 
Good but not what it used to be 
Well the binders are...ok....but empty-- and the alphabetical indexes provided only have the letter \W\ on them. 
Bought by mistake 
Does it's job but not very solid 
Good while it lasted 
Fast quiet but very small and shallow cup 
No frills sturdy sharpener for the deep pocketed and two-armed.

The picture does not do it \justice\ 
Special purpose tape 
Not as good as I had hoped 
decent refill 
Fine for the price but not for high-quality technical drawing 
Small but useful 
Nothing to write home about 
Mine arrived dried out

Store them point down 
Great for the Kids not for Work 
Fair... the smaller the board the better! 
They're perfect for kids hands but not mine 
Nice markers erasers fall off 
Mixed bag! 
A decent set of markers 
Bright Colors but Not Well Made 
Convenient but... 
Everything you ever need wrapped up into one pen.  It's about time!! 
Good for the price; hang upside down to avoid drying out 
Very bright not always easy to erase 
I have bought 6 packages all with different ratings 
Would Like a Finer Point 
Magnets work fine but markers need to be pushed hard 
nice colors but lacking quality 
Clever idea - but lacked to execute 
Okay but not great 
Reasonably handy but thin line and magnets are not very strong. 
Not as opaque as expected 
Bought Once to Try 
Pens worked but  magnets failed 
Magnetic dry-erase markers - poor quality 
Small but Useful 
Unsure about these 
3.5* - Erasers are flimsy 
I wish someone would do this right /  2nd one failed now 
Fine for sending garbage for getting. 
\Carbon Paper\ results becaue it uses \carbon paper\. 
Not for academic use. 
sturdy to feel at hand 
Nice markers poor color matching 
Great palette but could last longer 
Shades a little surprising but a good set of several colors 
Double duty clamshell! 
many color way too light to write with 
Great printer with a few big flaws.

Stand Out 
Not what I had hoped for 
Custom fit - not adjustable 
I really like it but I'm not sure I'd recommend it (strange eh?) 
It's Okay...claims to extend the mouse life. 
Effective but pricey 
Lots of nice features but not the most comfortable 
The primary value is in the rigid mouse pad and wrist pad surface 
works well but pricey 
For the price not exactly wonderful 
Not for me 
comfortable but not remarkable 
Far too limited for the price. 
Just okay--Repurposed 
Too expensive for what it does 
Adjustable - Once 
Does what it can do just not a full solution to my bad posture and achy hands 
Gel wrist guard is great but the platform has limited and fixed permanent choices for  calling it \adjustable \ 
Does what you expect 
Works well but runs out FAST 
As advertised but only purchase if you absolutely have to 
A mistake 
Canon printer always had stripes in solid areas. 
Always buying ink 
Problem with Borders 
Inconsisently says \out of paper\ and is an ink hog but good quality 
Minimally effective - does the job but has drawbacks 
Doesn't do all I needed 
Beautiful scans but weak flimsy plastic breaks too easily 
Just O.K. product. 
Good for the money 
Not As Expected. 
Would Not Buy Again 
Not especially practical.

Hit or miss 
Decent binder improvements needed in shipping

I want to give it 5 stars... but I can't! 
Quality Has Gone Down 
Always Need Ink 
OK scale for what I paid but there is a problem. 
Ok but make sure you purchase the right thickness for your floor type 
Great pencil but with weaker design than GG 500 
Not bad but the 500 is half the price 
Good if you're looking for cheap box to storage your documents to have them one place and avoid mess... 
Damaged 
Not meant for heavier items. 
Worth the price 
hard to assemble 
Average 
Too Small! 
Meh.. 
Not exactly happy with these

Not a true 6\ wide 
Smaller than you think 
Kind of thin but the price is great. 
Nice great price fast shipping but they seem to tear more easily than I am comfortable with. 
by the 68 if your printer supports it 
Axis far behind handle puts significant strain on user's arm 
sharpie doesn't let you down... 
Some good some bad. 
Narrow tip some too dark and I couldn't prove Smear Guard 
Sharpie makes better permanent markers 
Needs improvement 
A little too dark for highlighters

it's just string 
Decent Clips Short Nails 
A-OK at a good price. 
Beware the starter cartridge. ($100 scanner + $80 cartridge). 
There is better paper out there 
Shipping Warning 
Fine but clearly not the best choice 
Works but Awkward 
Requires Special Staples 
Comparison with Scotch \Premium\ 
Weak Adhesive: Does Not Stick Well 
Wish The Rools Were Larger 
just okay-not great 
They DO bleed to the other side of your paper! 
Fun but Limited 
Great value and beautiful colors but... 
see through 
Swingline Optime PowerEase - good 
Expected more 
Alas falls short of perfect 
Expansion is a bit clumsy 
Requires the right kind of paper 
Pencils but Not Painting Tools 
Great pencil but average as a painting pencil 
Too light on color intensity 
nice pencils but not so much for watercolors 
Purchased in February getting worried by issues in  July... 
Make sure your laptop display can open very wide

No better than the Dollar Tree cheapies 
Erases well but questioning durability 
Takes some elbow grease 
A Good 3M Product 
No water required 
Effective sponge type eraser for whiteboards 
Just OK - doesn't completely remove all ink marks 
NOT so effective sadly 
Doesn't Seem to Work as Advertised 
Sponge eraser it works and it's easily cleaned

Where Will You Use It? 
Hoping for much more... 
Buy Mr. Clean Magic Eraser and Save Some Money 
Okay? Sure. Necessary? No. 
Add Water For Dry-Erase? 
it's okay. 
Erases Well 
Maybe not magic... 
works as advertised but could have been better 
As good as the alternatives 
Good Product. 
A little flimsy 
Pros and cons 
Do you really need this... or will it be another unused gadget? 
Need to have Heat Control 
Disappointing 
Good for cutting in or outlining 
Lots of problems 
Check dimensions first 
Used daily however angle slider adjustment gets in way of pushing under desk 
Works pretty good 
Not for large paws 
Fairly low rent ploddingly effective 
Nifty and colorful... but is at what cost? 
Just okay 
OK but be prepared to assemble 
Very specific uses. 
Nothing great....

Won't Stay In Place 
Cheaper than at the store

Great for erasing thinner lines 
It's ink!

Ink runs out too fast 
Change the *10^n key to an EE key and you've got yourself a winner! 
Fails in comparison to other scientific non-graphing calculators 
Hated this calculator at first but then found some of its strong points 
Great value for the amount you get 
Works great for shipping smaller things

Good but very expensive 
Works well for what I needed 
Not The Best It Does Work... A little... 
Works but requires a good amount of elbow grease 
Good Points and Bad Points

Good Product But Expensive 
Quality Prints -- Poor Software 
Great home / home office laser printer

Has its Pros and Cons 
Good deal on a fair printer 
Not terrible. 
They're Just Ok 
Not good enough for me 
Disappointing 
Useful but a little overpriced

A very solid product: revised after 2 weeks use 
Good quality but surface a little too small 
Better than average

Doesn't really help with my carpel tunnel & tendonitis 
A little too thick 
Has pro's and con's based on your preferences.... 
All-in-one solution for the keyboard and the mouse. 
Too Large & Intrusive  for Most Keyboards 
Not too supple 
Good but not as soft as I expected... 
Consider the Shape 
Straight rest for the wrist 
Does not work with optical/laser mouse 
Not bad 
Removes large staples. 
Works well on removing heavy duty staples - wouldn't buy again...too bulky 
iffy for thinner paper 
Not the Best 
Easy to use with drawbacks 
Jelly Roll Pens - Ink Come out too fast doesn't last 
only slightly better than regulat Scotch tape. 
Good markers

I Like the Cheerful Pastel Colors But Folders Could Be Bigger 
DISAPPOINTED 
Good Solid Folder Except for Tab 
Lighter weight file in pleasant colors 
haiku plus review

Useful but the main feature isn't a feature 
Good but not special 
Keeping Tabs 
here are the specs 
ONLY IF YOU PLAN TO WRAP THINGS ALL DAY LONG 
It can be improved 
Difficult tradeoff between convenience and cost 
not sure 
Can't See This Replacing My Full-Size Tape Dispenser 
Works well for gift-wrapping but tape refills are too expensive 
Cute But Ultimately Pointless Gadget 
Neat new gadget 
It's okay. 
Very handy but refills are expensive 
Handy but limitation 
Works but is it worth it? 
Good for lots of taping but not worth it for occasional use 
Kids Like It - Too Much 
Convenient 50% of the time inconvenient the other 50%! 
3.5 Stars -- Some pros and cons 
Very handy dispenser - no pun intended 
Good concept poor execution 
Tape helper good but is this really needed? 
Interesting concept but I prefer regular tape rolls 
tape with handband 
Could be better 
Good idea quickly gets used up 
Easy to use.  A bit hard to load refills. 
Scotch PopUp Handband Tape Dispenser - A Great Time-Saving Tool 
Nice idea but not worth it if you have dispenser 
What to get the person who has everything 
I like it but... 
runs out quickly 
I could have used this handy dispenser years ago 
Not very cost effective 
Works great but just not necessary 
Good but... 
Great idea 
Why? 
Makes Life Easier for the Wrapping Impaired 
so-so 
Smooth sailing it is not. 
Sturdy 
Crooked Scans - Straight Results 
Got it 
It's OK could be better but is fine for casual use. Fair value. 
Mousepad w/ Gel Wrist Pad 
Love mousing surface-hate vinyl covered wrist rest 
Best mousepad yet until it curled up 
So-so mouse pad 
Not Intended for the Large Handed 
The edges curl up 
Nice - But I Wish It Were Larger 
Seems like a nice item but not for me 
Comfortable and modern-looking. Good for today's office decor. 
just a couple flaws on this sturdy mouse pad/wrist rest combo 
too small to be useful 
Good but not Great 
Loved the idea but pens went dry fast... 
A good quality product at a reasonable price

A great idea! 
OK Envelopes For General Use 
good envelope 
Okay if you have multiple pages inside. 
No different from other legal size envelopes 
Solid Envelopes 
security envelopes 
High quality envelopes but they do not seal 'flat'

Nice envelopes but security feature doesn't work 
Functional but not as convenient as other Press & Seal styles 
Seem to do the job 
Ok Envelopes 
Average envelopes 
Good concept the execution less so 
OK but not really tamper evident. 
Average but serviceable envelopes 
Nothing spectacular here but not bad either 
These envelopes stay glued better than most pre-glued envelopes 
Minimal privacy protection but sturdy. 
NOT QUITE AS ADVERTISED 
Not Really That Different 
Okay Not Great 
Good product but.. 
Mailings 
They're okay but not the most secure. 
NIFTY BUT FLAWED 
Lightweight privacy envelopes 
Secure Envelops 
Not really as described - they are ok envelopes - not tamper-revealing. 
Why pay extra for mediocrity 
Good for standard use but not for security 
Still doesn't beat the envelopes where users pull a strip to expose the adhesive... 
fine 
Nothing special 
LIke the Seal but This Envelope Still Reveals the Contents When Sealed 
An Ok Envelope Nothing Special 
Pushing the Envelope 
Where's The \Red\? 
OK Envelopes But There are Better Options 
Good standard envelop 
Really thin 
I prefer a different peel and seal type 
Nice envelopes that you don't have to lick 
Fine for luggage etc. but wheels too small. 
the cards are fine but the price leads to ingenious alternative solutions 
Thinnner 
Thin and expensive but they \work\ 
Somewhat overpriced but decent index cards 
Average Product 
Good if you don't need to handle the card often 
Thin... 
These would work for school research projects

Oh So Thin...Index Cards on a Diet!

Ok but could be better 
I've been setting up the printer for four hours now... 
good for an inexpensive laser 
Good buy but noisy 
Broken Network Card 
Good Printer Impossible to Set-Up Wireless Connection 
The older Parkers were so much better 
Not a gift pen 
Basic but works 
A solution in search of a problem 
Sturdy Plastic Sheath 
NOT Archival-Safe or Acid-Free 
Interesting variation on display tech 
Useful Depending on What You Have Planned 
Nice but the use is somewhat limited 
Functional But Overpriced 
Nice to display 'fridge art' 
It works 
Looks cheap but good for childs room wall. 
Stanley Home Design Magnetic Door Stop 
JUST OK 
Can't get glue adhesive off 
Dry 
Weak magnets modifications required 
Quartet Dry Erase Board (8.5 x 11) 
Has A Problem Staying Put.. 
Weak Magnetic Backing 
Not durable but does the job 
Weak Mounting Magnets Otherwise Ok 
Nothing Special About This Dry-Erase Board 
weak magnets will not hold board up 
Good bookends do the job nothing extraordinary 
too small & light to be of much use 
Buy Cheap Get Cheap 
Range is good but long time battery life stinks 
AT&T Not What It Used To Be 
DECT 6.0 not as interference free as they claim 
Very good but many drawbacks! 
It works but........... 
Mixed feelings... 
Takes some getting used to 
SCRAPED PAINT 
Significant issue makes it only 3 star worthy 
A lot for the money 
Not so sure after using for a while 
weird; super thin and not very sticky 
Nice - but could be better 
It's too small for my taste 
Warm and Bright 
Sticky Situation 
Laminate good times come on! (It's a lamination....) 
Fine for Certain Things 
Convenient but Too Thin. Inadequate Protection for Small Items Such As ID Cards. 
Works ok 
Easy to use but so-so presentation quality 
Not commercial grade product .... 
Plastic.  No tools assembly.  Good not great 
There's a reason this is less than $40 
Bought it for my classroom 
There must be a better way... 
strong chemical odor upon arrival.... 
Expected more from 3M 
Wish it was a bit softer. 
It's okay but... 
Firm Foam wrist rest...gel is better 
Sometimes bigger really is better 
If there is a difference I have yet to discover it 
Could stand to be wider 
Stick with gel 
Supportive But Some Downsides 
Great resting...horrible chemical scent 
A bit disappointed 
Battery consumption is an issue! 
A Good American-Made Binder But Expensive 
It works it's overpriced 
Price is a barrier. 
Hey...it's a binder and an expensive one at that. 
Too expensive for the lacking quality 
It's really nice but there are better options for much less money 
Misleading Information 
Liked the Big Tab not the folder 
Average product 
Very lightweight folders with a twist 
SuperTab? Not really. 
Helpful if you are using only these folders 
They're file folders nothing remarkable

Art Chalk 
Vibrant Colors Expensive Chalk 
Eleven Dollars for a Box of Chalk!!! 
Not as vibrant as hoped 
Nice Ink but Not the Color I Had Expected 
Expensive but does what it says 
Just another sharpener 
Loved it at first then it tanked 
New One: Still works great at 6mths - Old One: After a while only sharpened one side of pencil 
its ok just expensive 
Use a lot of photo paper.. 
A heavy-duty product I think best for office situations 
Very heavy duty some effort to install but works OK. 
You need to be handy! 
ink 
it's not as good as expected 
Works but somewhat flimsy 
Functional especially for smaller hands 
Good writing Pen but...... 
Very comfy but sometimes falls apart 
for very tall people who weigh less than 250 lb 
Easy Assembly. AMAZON SELLS FOR $79 
Just okay 
Some fit and finish issues 
Not much RAM really slow speeds 
Looks great sounds great feels great BUT... 
Feature Stuffing! 
Great potential cut short by annoying flaws and design shortcomings. 
Pins are abit on the small side and the pink is not very vibrant 
Okay Printer Scanner Copier with not so good Fax and Sofware and Horrible Technical Support 
200 pages indeed! 
Better buy a few 
Good Bang for your $ ... But Misleading Rating... 
Good Price

Not The Longest Lasting Ink 
It's Ink 
Decent Results...Small Cartridge... 
Not The Longest Lasting Ink 
Decent printer.... 
An improvement but still some very irritating features. 
Not very comfortable 
Too Small 
Pretty and functional but not very comfortable. 
Cute but the gel-filled wrist rest is actually useless 
Mouse pad with gel wrist rest 
Should Be Bigger 
Going back to Liquid Paper DryLine Grip! ! 
Like mousing on sandpaper 
Works but can only be used once

Not quite what I expected... 
They're pens... 
Did Not Like!

Should be black 
Wish I could say it was a better printer 
BIG! 
Great concept but a little awkward 
Not Sure What I'll Use This For 
Lots of good features but not as expandable as it could/should be 
Has Its Uses But Not A Universal Storage And Organization Solution 
Nothing against this product but the price 
Good for backpacks but not for clipboards. 
Love the idea 
Good for keeping things contained 
Room for improvement 
3 1/2 Stars - Great Cork Portion But Some Construction Issues 
Board does not allow versatility in positioning. 
I would get it again but have some reservations 
Overpriced but decent. 
Excellent calculator poor construction 
Meh... okay based only on quantity of ink it will hold 
Wishing for better quality pen refills 
these dry up very quickly 
so so 
Neat but not one-size-fits-all 
Super Printer? 
Poor Horizontal Line Quality in Faster Modes 
Works with Linux but... 
Chalk Holder 
An \old-fashioned\ black ink; not for checks 
Works really well on the right size document 
ACLU card yes bowling ball no 
honestly 
It's a pen 
Nicely Made Sleeves 
They're all right... 
Good product but expensive 
Spring broke after very few uses. 
Paper Mate White Pearl Premium Erasers 
Writes smoothly but needs to be darker 
Washable blue ink 
Not as good as Pilot G2 but a nice pen nonetheless 
Not nearly as impressed as others here. 
Slow 
Okay 
Unit cost too high 
Little Use Laminator 
only for large pieces of paper. 
It's alright but with a few quirks 
5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = a halo-effect 3-star average 
Not easy to use as heated one 
Lightweight and easy to grasp but imperfect to use 
Not What the Pro's Use 
Only get this if you don't tape very often 
OK for home use 
Nice feel but some issues 
Lives up to it's name but... 
decent tape dispenser 
Cost is an issue 
ok for sealing boxes but I've used better 
Some nice details but still prefer the large tape guns. 
Good for homeowner use not for lots of shipping 
Handy & Attractive Dispenser 
No better than the standard dispenser 
Bic is a great brand 
Lead breaks too easily 
No Difference 
Responds to light touch. Not sure it's designed for daily or heavy-duty use; can't open to use on flat surfaces. 
Good not great 
Utilitarian folder for big projects 
Wonderful Idea but Overpriced for Card stock 
Great organizer for 8.5\ x 11\ (or even smaller) papers 
Functional but not great 
Ideal for small or light-weight packaging. 
Fair Product 
Compared to my Fujitsu Ill stick with the Fujitsu 
Not as impressive as I thought it would be... 
Great hardware and software combination at a very premium price 
Some installation problems but works but very expensive. 
Hardware is nearly there but software falls a bit short 
Mediocre Scanner 
How cool is this?!!!  [WAIT read to the end for not-so-cool bits.] 
OK but not the simple solution I'd hoped for 
Not for everyday folks but some business users will like 
A great idea but really slow 
can not be used outside of the program but scans okay. 
OK for archiving not so much for bookkeeping 
Seems Like a Good Idea - but Not Practical 
For the business traveler 
Just OK 
[Updated] It was \Neat compact efficient and handy\ but... 
If you buy it do it for the software! 
needed it 
order frequentlydon't print that much 
Maybe it's my printer but... 
expensive for everyday printing 
Good ink small amount

Works but don't like the feet 
It's a plastic monitor platform... 
It Works For Special Situations 
Fellowes Monitor Riser 
Works fine but flimsy looking for the price

Wish the cover was sturdier 
Can be a good office notebook 
Nice But Feels A Little Off 
Good and bad features 
A different kind of notebook 
Good for Using at Lectures 
Great concept; too much wasted space. 
A problem if you have lots of sheets to protect 
ok 
ok 
Marred surfaces 
Not very good very low quality desk accessory 
Why so separate? 
It's Ink...Blue...And Liquid At Room Temperature 
When you own an inkjet printer you have bought into price gouging by manufacturers for the printer ink. 
Almost perfect 
A gift 
Ink comes off from printing when touched 
Does the job but expensive 
As advertised 
Dry erase Board and Marker only ... no eraser 
Who is giving all these high reviews? 
... the nib is not as smooth as I would like for it to be 
Good not great... 
I WOULD OF RATHER SPEND A BIT MORE MONEY AND HAVE NO LEAKAGE!! DISAPPOINTED 
A Basic Phone with a Cheap Headset 
Works well but a really a bit out of date already. 
Good 
Some nice features but not enough 
Low Smell is nice but doesn't last as long either 
Ink looks like watered down paint 
Average 
all right 
Possibilities limitless but wastes labels and quality moderate 
Bad installation - good label printing 
Good enough for text-only labels 
It's nice but not needed by most... 
Very Slick Little Item 
Good decent phone overall.  Battery life not so great. 
Only fairly sticky 
Useful but VERY BASIC device for learning some common phrases. 
Great Idea but Could be Better... 
Functions fine but actual field test is only way to know.. 
It's Ok But Fragile 
Maybe I received a bum unit? 
Read the instructions AND practice (save phrases) BEFORE you need it ... 
Nifty Idea But Falls Short 
Needs improvement! A book is faster! 
Pleasing Translator Best Used As A Learning Toy. 
Good for the price and in a pinch... 
Seems to be for a very specific kind of traveler - and it's not me 
+ 1/2 star: good but not the best 
moderate-stick labels with a green bent 
as good as but not better than normal file folders 
Some nice features but too thin 
Easier to read labels easier to differentiate files COSTLY 
Love the colors... 
Gets the job done but doesn't inspire confidence 
It does its job 
A good functional sharpener 
Average Electric Pencil Sharpener 
Not as good as my Bostitch 
A decent sharpener 
our least favorite sharpener 
It's like sticking a  4 cylinder engine in a big old Caddy 
Not bad Low Use Sharpener 
Doesn't suit my needs - but may work well for you 
Just okay 
Lots of Colors~ 
Uncomfortable. 
Average quality chair | Still better than what you'd find at an office supply store 
Needs more magnet strength. 
Writing surface holds smudges 
Cute but needs stronger magnets 
Great for a cheapie whiteboard 
Yes it's okay.... 
Magnets are weak but board works great 
It's OK 
OK 
OK 
Beware HP Ink Claims/Messages 
Not what I had expected... 
Not as good as the bullet pen and feels kind of cheap 
Is not easy to write cleanly with this pen 
Cheap price cheap product. 
Works slightly better than traditional labels 
Useful but not essential 
Apply to clean flat paper surfaces only 
Very good phone system 
Generic brand labels differ depending on who you buy from. 
withholding final judgement 
Great printer (for a while) support not so great 
Avoid 8500 if you use Quicken 
Uses more ink than HP claims! 
adequate but unexciting 
The majority of the cost is due to the wireless - make sure you need it. 
Wireless Stopped Working 
Swingline Optima Handles the Big Stapling Jobs Most of the Time 
A little too complex for its capability 
It works but it's big heavy and expensive. 
Easily removed yet still stick good again and again 
Use this as a place to keep my gift cards 
It works. Not as well as my thirty-year-old sharpener but it works. 
HUGE loud and time consuming 
Had high hopes... 
Not your ordinary pen. 
Works well for temporarily holding things 
Works Well Only To A Point...Don't Reposition Too Many Times. 
It works 
A Fair Label but not realiable 
Impressive pencil sharpener but there are better ones out there for less money 
good sharpener 
awesome! except when a pencil gets stuck then it is useless 
Interesting Sharpener 
Works just fine a little louder than our current sharpener 
Can only recommend with great caution 
Task chair for normal folks a regular chair for us of greater stature

Sturdy Chair Poor Manufacturing 
Great Product 
Great printing low ink consumption but not reliable 
It's like a fidgety kid it may be demon possessed 
Good product but overpriced. 
Good quality filing tabs...Get it if you like florescent colors 
Not As Good As Another Named Brand Of Filing Tabs 
Tabs are somewhat see-through 
Reusable 
nice but not enough in package 
For Hanging Folders 
Useful within another file 
Dull colors made visual organization harder 
Thin cheap feeling cardboard folders 
Disappointed 
A clever idea however.... 
SLOOOWWWWW for home use only 
good personal use printer but not really good as an \office\ AIO 
Great machine for the money 
Mixed Feelings 
Freezer tape vs. labels 
Just OK 
It's been about 6 months

Great generic battery for price 
missing slot for headset 
Worst customer service 
Didn't connect

It's actually a good phone but... 
Extra Phone 
Lasted 5 months 
A little flimsy 
Standard security envelopes. Could be better

Very good if you need ledger printing. Not so good if you don't. 
Not too sticky.

Brother Toner... as good as the printer it goes in 
Decent dictionary not so good sound quality 
Handy little gadget! 
Handy but lacks documentation for all the features jammed into this device 
Workso Prettyo Goodo! 
Could be helpful in a pinch - but not as straightforward and simple to use as I'd like 
Good But could be a bit better. 
Good Dictionary - Good Sound - Bad Instructions 
Good printer with some deal breakers 
Not very easy to assemble but the boxes protect 
The standard bearer 
Kind of cheap quality for the price 
It's okay but nothing more 
Just right size 
Decent board good size but the pen is bad and it left the factory damaged 
Basic board. A bit too expensive. No mounting hardware. 
Functional 
Decent cleaner and eraser pens very nice narrow lines but ink hard to clean 
Not so great. Good color but lots of smears. 
Doesn't Work Like I'd Hoped 
No Problem with Writing or Erasing 
D 
Just Okay 
It looks cool but doesn't work as expected. 3.5 stars 
don't need one 
Pictures can be bit misleading 
Hard sell 
A bit uncomfortable...not seeing the need.... 
Doesn't act like a pencil and takes some getting used to... 
An ok mech. pencil but I'm happy with the cheap ones 
great pencil 
Really tough lead is that enough? 
Innovative but falls a bit short 
uni-ball Pencil 
Spongy and imprecise 
eh hype 
Neat idea but not for me 
Good but a little wobbly 
It's okay. 
Works well as a pencil but...... 
Not quite 
Good but needs improvement. 
Kuru Toga Mechanical Pencil Review 
Worst Epson I've owned 
Not a Great deal but Better than retail 
Bought this for a rather junky inkjet printer... 
Solid printer unreasonably expensive ink 
Compatible to the Brother cartridges but the colors were not true 
They do the job 
It will crack and fall apart in 6 months 
nice colors but 
a decent sharpener 
Did the job but not as strong as other boxes 
okay for most uses 
Good for Moving or Storage 
Average strength great design 
Storage boxes you may need 
Pricey But Useful Boxes 
Boxes are solid but questionable reusability 
A Good Moving Box But A Little Pricey 
Not really what I thought they were... 
Nice printer.  Frustrating and buggy software. 
Great product BUT 
Hook 'n Go 
Only recommended if you want to latch a notebook to a binder. 
A little expensive for the quality... 
Can be useful but some features are lacking 
a good idea 
Not necessarily suited for special needs kids... 
good tool for beginning penmanship 
Nothing amazing here 
My son couldn't get into this one. 
Interesting product but mixed on helpfulness 
Unnecessary 
Constrains beginning writers 
Fine product but over priced 
Good quality paper but one problem 
It works & it's the loudest home shredder ever.... 
works okay 
Nice Phone But No Live Person In Service To Help Me 
A bit watery don't love the color 
Too over-built and heavy although sturdy 
2nd attemp to write a review 
Disappointing 
Useful product small packet 
Useful Little Index Tabs Another Good Idea from Post-Its 
Needs Documentation 
Good pointer presenter but... 
Nice little product but $75 seems a little high 
Take 3 gadgets strip functionality and mold them into 1 piece. 
Good but way overpriced 
Handy laser pointer controller and USB storage for your Powerpoint presentations 
A bit pricey 
Comfortable to hold but a tad expensive and not very bright 
Where's the On Button? 
Good: Simple elegant ergonomic....Bad: Price 
Price point here is the death knell .. 
No Wow Factor Here 
Lexmark Wireless 3-in-1 Printer - updated 
Way overpriced sticky notes 
Neat idea and cute but still searching for practical applications 
Nothing Special - Won't Stick to Every Material Type 
Different from Post-It notes and mostly in good ways. 
Weak adhesive and average durability. 
Great product but way overpriced! 
Great little labels 
Easy to remove but doesn't always stay in place 
Not sticky enough 
Time will tell 
Temporary Not \Removable\ 
These are okay but not much to get excited about 
An Average Product 
Removable Label Pads 
Great idea but edges curl too much to be practical 
Truly Temporary! This limits the applications. 
They are labels and have color! 
Strong !! 
Work as stated but nothing special 
A label that is easy to remove 
Decent labels but not as sticky as I would want it 
Avery Label Pad is just like a post-it note pad 
It's no Post-It 
Better for removeable than reusable 
Good labels for Typing 
OK label but not a great Avery product 
Not sure what they're thinking but.... 
Nice quality paper - too small 
Self adhesive labels that's all. 
Decent shipping labels but could be better 
Small Labels 
A Little Pricey for a Basic Label Not Sure How Useful They'd Be for Most 
Permanent Labels for Hand Writing Only 
Perfectly acceptable item that could have more value for others than it did for me. 
Ok 
let me try to help everyone having trouble 
Printing Around The Edges 
I'm skeptical of all toners... 
Nice but not for serious photographer

A printer with many caveats... 
Wireless 2.4GHz Windows Keyboard with Trackball 
Not sure I like the thick hooks 
Ok but very bulky desktop unit. 
they work 
A good value 
After reading the reviews on this guy I had my doubts 
Stainless steel finish plastic :) 
Looks good but magnets are not strong enough 
Nice design with minor issues 
Pretty but weak magnets greatly lessen its value 
Just okay... 
Insufficient Magnets Make This Difficult To Use 
Functions well but looks very cheap 
Has some important limitations 
mounting magnets too weak otherwise ok 
an okay idea not well-executed 
Great for students and teachers 
Think it's leaving a residue 
Not too bad 
Easy to use but expensive 
Didn't realize this required a subscription 
A Nice Starter Package 
A Lot of Fine Print But It's Nice If You Need Lots of Postage. 
I like Stamps.Com...this is one way to get started. 
Not as Great as the White Label But Still Good 
Nice to clean up a box but not good for printing an address on 
Great for improving the look of a box but don't print postage etc. on them 
interesting but not sure about useful 
Works Great 
great labels but white are much easier to see and cheaper 
Good for reusing boxes; not great for address labels 
Great labels but worth the price? 
not intuitive at all 
why is it so big? 
Do the job 
Sometimes ok sometimes great 
Excellent adhesive.  Thin stock. 
Has some problems..... 
Might Be A Little Excessive 
3M Labels Are Fine But Instruction For Using The Templates Are Lacking 
Easy-remove 
See through! 
Holiday Mailing 
LABEL PADS 
Doesn't work on plastic totes! 
Full label is sticky but not super sticky 
These are so-so 
Basically A Post-In Note With Adhesive Across The Whole Thing 
not that different from regular post-its 
Good idea maybe needs a little tweaking ... 
Not lovin' them as much as I did at first.... 
Good but not great 
Good 
pricey 
Works well but has limited uses 
Sticky-back tags 
Great Idea Not a Great Product 
Good but quirky pricey.  Post-It Color Coding labels better option?... 
Mable Mable if you're able get a color coding label 
Bold 
Great product not sure why it's called \Super Sticky\ 
They certainly are bright! 
Not for use as postal mailing labels but good for organizing 
Great for easy identification 
Decent 
Love them - but paper width/thickness may pose problem for some printers 
Neat Idea 
Kinda so-so 
Not good for plastic bins 
3M Lables Are Fine But Lack instruction For Using Printing Template 
Compatible with Avery Standard labels 
Rather ordinary 
Does what it says! 
Not quite aligning right 
A bit thin and see-through 
Average labels -- not so thick 
only draw back is size 
Too small... 
A Nice Product But... 
Not great. 
A probably dying need done moderately well 
Meets my needs...slightly better than average performance 
What's So Great About Labels? 
Two lines only 
Sticky and small 
2000 teeny tiny labels 
They are ok but 
I prefer larger labels 
Return Address Labels 
not perfect 
3M Labels Are Fine But Instruction For Using The Templates Are Lacking 
Removable Adhesive File Folder Labels 
Temporary solution for filing needs 
Great way to reorganize your filing system but smudge with laser printing (inkjet fine) 
I'll probably stick with Avery (har har) 
We put these through a variety of tests - they work great for us but design flaw may cause printer jamming 
Pretty good product 
Stick Well but not the Brightest: Check Prices of Competitors 
Thin and see through... 
Holds back interior doors fine but isn't hard enough- difficult to put in place with just your foot 
Lots of options 
complicated 
2 year assessment (purchased this day 2 years ago) 
Not bad at all but not a great thing too 
Best Black ink for the Lexmark Pro901 printer 
Neat product but... 
Good for specialty labeling needs 
Questionable longevity 
Useful but Templates are PEST! 
Serviceable 
Slightly stickier than a Post-It made for a printer 
Not To Bad But Could Be A Bit Better 
Make Garage Sales Much Less Work 
Nice idea 
A Change of Opinion 8 Months Later. Originally a Beautiful High Resolution Photographics Eats Ink But a Great Step Up 
Slightly disappointed 
Good for Home Use 
Don't expect a perfect binding on your first try 
Useful and works okay 
OK for small quick jobs that don't have to look professional 
Good for at home use 
Good product for the design 
Love them - but we love Post-Its more 
good for a specific use 
Tab It: An Avery NoteTabs Review 
These are good but almost too thick 
A Bit Fuzzy but Otherwise an Okay Buy 
Good for some not for others 
They do what they should... and a bit more 
Seem Expensive For What They Are 
Nice product but flawed 
Depends on what you want them for. 
AVERY Note Tabs---Not Bad 
expensive for 20 numbered tabs 
handy 'pocket' for specialized use 
Convenient but too lightweight 
Not reliable or terribly useful 
Nice product but limited usefulness 
I wanted to like these... 
Handy for putting CDs in bound material 
Average at Best 
Innovative but not all that functional 
Avery CD Size PocketTabs- Great Idea but needs stronger adhesive! 
Okay nothing fabulous 
Easy to use 
Good basic label printer for price. 
Clunky and pricey but what is the alternative 
it is ok 
Good Scissors for learning to cut 
Germ free? But look dirty. 
not as good quality as a Fiskar or other brands like Scotch 
Pretty Sharp 
Great start: needs improvement! 
Great for very short-term but \become permanent with time\ 
Tab It: An Avery NoteTabs Review 
neat 
3 inches is too long for my purposes 
I don't quite get these! 
A Good *Idea* But Falls Short... 
good organizational tool 
Green notes 
Neat features but utility is questionable 
Weird size otherwise OK 
Don't care for the huge adhesive footprint of these tabs 
You get what you pay for for good and for bad 
Useful for those who frequently review hard copy content 
Good for the hyper-organized 
Best for thick-sheeted scrapbooks 
Terrific item for a limited set of users I think 
They are good for some 
Best for college students imho. 
Very nice product 
Good for organizing but could be better 
Avery NoteTabs (16336) 
Neat Item but Not Versatile 
ON THE FENCE 
Great idea for some applications 
Nice idea great functionality  might be trying to do too much 
Good for heavy duty books not for everything 
Good product but could be better. 
Good for the organized 
Helpful but other options might work better 
Useful but only for those who have a need 
Good but limited uses 
not very useful 
There are better alternatives 
Nice idea but... 
Does what it claims 
Seemed like a great idea at the time 
High Quality Product For a Unique Need 
does what it does at a steep price 
Nice but EXPENSIVE! 
Another fine product from Avery! 
Great but expensive! 
Labels work well way overpriced 
Great professional looking labels but may be cost ineffective 
Not cost effective 
Works Great Speeds Up Workflow but Quite Expensive 
Great quality labels at a high cost 
Nice Unit on second one.New Problems 
Very cute but not a workhorse 
Pretty But Cheap 
Nice color hard to use 
Lightweight multi-pocket filer tote with clasp and handle 
Decent carrier but I don't expect it to last too long 
sturdy 
Durable and lighweight 
Cheap 
Not Durable 
pretty small for us 
Mini Organizer 
Functions well 
Does the job but not customizable 
Great when it works 
EDITED: not so perfect hand-sized stapler for those with hand strength issues 
brand new and already sticks a bit 
Good stapler 
Not bad for light use but it has limitations 
An ok stapler 
It's okay. 
Good for home use 
Cheap ink wifi but..... 
Only OK - lack of dedicated photo tray and color ink requirement disappointing 
My Celebrity Apprentice printer is finally here! 
It's just OK but check out other printer before buying 
Adequate Performance no Fax function 
Glossy Kodak ESP 5250 Wi-Fi 
OK printer with a few shortcomings. 
Decent but not great... 
Prior model is better - Missing document feeder renders fax virtually useless - Touchsmart Web is a gimmic 
Nice Printer 
UPDATED REVIEW- BROKE FAST...Not perfection but fixed fast 
Solid easy to grip reinforced side gussets but too expensive 
Standard Issue + Plus 
A nice idea but needs to be more secure 
Fine for what I use it for 
Too flimsy for travel 
Flimsy 
Nice Idea but Too Pricey for the Quality 
Pricey but Works Well 
Not durable enough given the price 
Nice Idea but Flimsy 
Would Have Been Perfect If It had a Closure for the Larger Section 
Lightweight and handy but less effective than a sturdy binder 
Decent chair 
Decent but nothing special 
Post office mix up...item received 
Handy and doesn't sag 
nice little organizational tool 
3.5 Stars 
Not Revolutionary 
Ended up returning it but may be good under certain conditions 
It Works 
Steep initial cost unusable caller id in basic plan 
Flimsy but it's okay 
Lock is kind of tricky. 
Doesn't last long at all 
Great printer...setup not so great 
Gives You Great Color Prints at an Affordable Price! 
Great all in one for the office! 
A reasonable choice unless you require duplex 
some good some not 
Good ink for a Lexmark Pro901 
Good for Small Projects 
For Impressing Clients 
Pendaflex Organize Project Management System 
It's a Presentation Portfolio 
Well made organizer 
$30?  Really?!?! 
Sturdy and Expandable to a Certain Extent 
Seemed overly complicated 
Looks slick not really any better than your average binder 
Trying to organize 
If you want luggage tags 
Disappointed 
I far prefer the LapGear DELUXE LapDesk over this LapGear Jumbo LapDesk. 
Could use a better surface or a ridge on the bottom. 
It's Okay But There Are Easier Ways To Get The Job Done 
Cool design 
Nice colors too easily smeared -- nothing special for the price 
A little messy 
Maybe I got a bad batch 
Brilliant colors- some ink flow issues 
Decent pens 
Neat for kids 
best for 4 to 5-year-olds 
I think they put the wrong age groups on the cover. 
Practice of Number Writing Made Easy 
Numbers yes; Stories no. 
May Work For Some Pre-Schoolers But Too Easy for Kindergardners 
Not sure where the number \stories\ comes into play 
Not a bad idea however.... 
Best for the summer between K & 1st grade 
How to build a sentence. 
Helpful to my daughter for her cursive letters 
I nice intro to creative writing but simplistic 
Nice concept 
Better suited for 1st and 2nd grade 
It's OK 
HELPFUL FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH WRITING 
If you work with 2nd graders...pass this by 
Colorful but... 
Basic Writing Prompts 
Another simple idea overpriced 
Basic building blocks for writing skills 
Very heavy duty. 
Decent board but make sure you buy some different pens 
HI 
All these scales are the same! 
Home-Brew 
Greenwashing ... 
Thick plastic tab attachments for folders 
Smead Easy Slide Tabs - Decent Innovation But Still A Work In Progress 
Not quite what I was expecting 
maybe a good product but not for universally for everyone 
These labels work great but cost too much 
Way Too Expensive 
Great quality labels at a high cost 
Ok but 
Good Quality but Too Big! 
Decent paper shredder but not so good for credit cards 
So So Shredder 
Works but too loud for small office! 
average  nothing sectacular nothing bad.  just a good price. 
Wish Someone Would Build a Better Lap Desk 
I've had blenders that work beter. 
Too bad 
Three Stars 
Bargus 
Sticky Notes with Not So Much Stick.. 
How come none in plain old white??????? 
Good in Some Situations 
Not as advertised but usable 
Keep tabs on your notes 
for the anal retentive but too expensive 
Quite Flimsy 
Beware! 
Not comfortable for me but a decent chair for a smaller frame that needs good support 
It Has Potential But Not for Husky Guys Like Me 
Some good some bad things with this chair 
Nice Office/Computer Chair 
Intek Refill Kit 
N700 Speaker Lapdesk - Imperfect But It Fills A Niche 
Is a great printer until....*don't buy it 
Excellent except for Ink Useage 
I LOVE this printer BUT. . . 
Concerns about color quality 
Great printing epic setup 
Ink Eater 
Frustrating... 
Decent footrest but weak fan. 
Could be much better 
OK as a footrest.. climate control not so much 
Low on the List of Necessary Products but It Helps My Back 
Five-star concept two-star execution. 
Noisy fan.  Footrest too thick for long legs in flat position. 
Maybe it's us but we can't seem to get it to work...? 
nice little office device 
Solid construction; I wish it were more adaptable 
Has some flaws but the wife seems to enjoy it. 
good support but fan stopped working. 
It's OK... 
Perfect for the office 
Great prints but no more Kodak 
Foot Rocker Needs Improvements.... 
Item will not go together as descibed. If you have enough room to get a good angle it is a comfortable rest 
Hmmm 
Needs more features and a wider range of adjustable options 
Can't get the wheels on 
Tough to assemble squeaky no manual 
Did Not Assemble Properly 
difficult to erase 
Not how I thought it would work  ~ 
Just your basic pen 
Not exactly what i am used to from Bic. 
Good sharpener with some drawbacks 
Weigh Your options carefully 
Bogs down easy but does well with re-sharpening 
Not Bad But Not Great 
Nice looking sharpener 
iPoint  Pencil Sharpener Does the Job But Lacks Visible Support 
Grinder 
Acceptable but not great 
Bit expensive for the power! 
Sharpens fine but user experience is less than ideal 
Not too terribly impressed 
Average pencil sharpener with great design 
Know of better sharpeners 
Takes too long; can't get a really sharp point 
Thoroughly Adequate 
Ok for low use but not meant for anything more 
Pretty good but not great - 3.5 stars 
Great Pencil Sharpener Except . . . 
You'll need the cleaner for sure 
BIC Dry Erase Marker Kit 
nice replaceable eraser! 
Great cleaning but... 
Limited Use--Must Have a Flat Wall 
Thin & rough velvet \velcro\ 
Still has the problem of attaching in a humid climate 
Roughly equivalent to mirror mounting tape in strength 
Not intended for use on windshield 
Strong fastener with inadequate adhesive 
Smooth writing but the barrel is friable 
Not the best pens for the price. 
wish the pen felt a little nicer 
'Professional Look' a 'Triumph' for BIC. Writes you know like Hemingway or Palin even. 
Not ideal for a lefty and a bit larger than \fine\ 
An acceptable writing implement 
The temperamental pen 
Good pen for those with carpal tunnel or arthritis 
Good Markers But... 
Rather clunky 
It works but is it necessary? 
Cute and handy but best for the true Post-It fan 
Small Convenience At A Small Cost 
Convenient but average product 
cute post-It despenser 
Uses non-standard post-it's and plastic dispenser is tacky 
It's OK but pricey for what it is 
Completely unnecessary little widget works well enough for clutter-freaks 
A Simple Holder for Post-It Notes; Entire Pad Comes Out Too Easily 
Typical post-it dispenser 
OK not miraculous 
Another option for Post-it lovers but not as good as expected 
Handy  but unnecessary Post-It holder 
Non-Essential But Handy In The Right Environment 
It Sounds Good In Theory 
Cute & Handy Pop Ups 
Another Plastic Gadget 
Pop-up works but velcro doesn't 
works wall-mount is a nice touch but do you need it? 
Post-it has let me down 
Handy but...Doesn't use regular post its! 
I'm iffy about Kodak in general 
Good Quality But. 
Good Price 
It's Okay......... 
Same Old Problems but probably the best of the lot 
very tiny but good 
acceptable 
Evil Necessity 
phones 
Nothing special about these 
The long cord is a problem for me 
Swingline Retractable Badge Reel 
Good on pocket or belt 
Colorful badge reels! 
About average 
decent but so many options out there 
No alligator clip limited ways to clip 
Good Idea 
Nice colors good price though spring is pretty weak... 
Not quite what I was hoping for 
Not that much of an upgrade 
A Functional Pad 
Inexpensive but Limited 
Hard to use 
Good printer/scanner 
Could be worse could be much better 
Crease machine overall very good 
Good OEM Ink but a poor combo 
Its heart is in the right place. 
Better than expected but a little pricy for cardboard I think 
Nice idea literally a bit rough around the edges 
Good idea but lacks in execution 
Very ROUGH binder 
so so 
Too Light in Weight. 
CUTE but Looks and Feels Cheap. 
Cool design but needs added weight too light and will fall over easily 
A fashion statement but not very useful 
Cute 
Cute but Flimsy 
Fun but Lacks Some Function 
Cute but needs improvement! 
Cute girly gift but a little top-heavy 
Cute item but too lightweight 
Only for 2 handed tape dispensing 
Cute but needs a lot more weight 
It's adorable but... 
Really cute. 
Darling but it IS too lightweight 
Good probably not worth the small downsides 
Convenient but unnecessary 
Good product but not as good as it could be (3 1/2 stars) 
Do I Really Need Another Gadget? 
gets the job done but 
Works very well but expensive to use. 
A pretty nice specialized product -but not for everyone. 
A better mousetrap. 
Underwhelmed 
Nice Concept But Not That Practical 
Nice Albeit Pricey Tape Dispenser. Functions as Advertised. Made for Gadget Fans or Those Who Like to Use Pre-Cut Tape Pieces. 
Handy but perhaps a bit overdesigned 
Still Can't Beat A Roll Of Scotch Tape But...... 
Not very practical or economical 
Cute little item but maybe not for a desk at work 
Just OK 
A Handy But Pricey Tape Dispenser 
just a gadget.. 
Am I not doing this right? 
Great idea but flawed 
It's a great idea but . . . 
OK But Not Great 
A once-a-year purchase 
Okay for specific purposes 
It sticks! 
OK The Lazy Person In Me 
Fun and kinda handy but a product few people need 
Once you how to set it up . . . 
Convienence at a cost. 
Interesting concept but hardly an improvement in tape dispensing 
Good for kids or the office but not for everything. 
fun but I'm not crazy about specialty refills 
more of a gimmick 
Good concept. ok execution 
Have to buy special tape packets for it 
Handy but it doesn't really stick to a desk 
Serves the purpose - nothing too special 
Good for Paper and really light stuff ... 
good but not as safe  as you might think 
Good but do you really need it? 
great way to hang items 
They are ok 
Nice for light stuff. 
Wow!  Sticky! 
Great if you only have posters to hang (Revised review) 
Couldn't handle a poster 
sticks to most things very well but doesn't remove from paper 
Useful in certain circumstances - 3-1/2 stars 
For Lightweight Mounting: A Scotch Reusable Tabs R100 Review 
pretty good for light weight objects 
good idea but? 
Useful for select applications 
So much more attractive than strips of tape 
Strongly recommended as a substitute for tacks (beware of painting removal from your walls) 
A Good Idea for Those Who Can Use Them 
Nice Idea But Limited Uses 
Sticky yes... perhaps too sticky 
cute but flimsy 
Cute but doesn't feel very sturdy 
flimsy 
Try harder next time 
Fine .. for kindergarten 
This tape is okay...... 
It's Tape 
The tape we have known for years in a slightly revised dispenser 
At the end of the day it's just tape 
Loch Ness Tape dispenser 
Better Than Glue?  In Some Ways Yes Others No 
Nice concept but adhesive not that strong 
Definitely useful for selective tasks but a bit expensive 
Not good not bad 
not what I expected 
Gadget; but is it a serious tool? 
Good For Scrapbooking 
great product but not environmentally friendly 
A great alternative to traditional tape & gluesticks but not so permanent... 
May be great for some purposes but not so great for mine. 
Good alternative to double-sided tape poster putty and tacks 
Great for light stuff 
Reusable Within Limits 
Fine for paper & cards but won't hold much else 
Work well but not very strong. 
A temporary solution but not a great one. 
Great product at first but... 
Not up to the task 
Not exactly \super sticky\ but convenient idea 
Neat Idea 
Doesn't stick how's that super sticky? 
Great concept but doesn't stick to EVERYTHING 
Great Idea! 
Not in love ~ 
Works but covers up a lot on the page 
I'm Rather Organized But Have Zero Use For These 
Good concept but not as practical as I'd like 
Over the top 
Labels are huge which is good for writing; too sticky though 
Useful in a fairly limited way. 
Thin glue can get messy. Dries white so don't use for clear products. 
BEST super glue and I'll tell ya why 
It is what it is 
Each Tube a Single Use 
Not For Free Endicia Postage Accounts 
good for now! 
Inadequate Word List In My Opinion 
Average to Good Gadget 
Good tool for elementary grades 
Great for kids. A little limited for adult needs. 
Not much better than the competitor... 
Decent scanner room for improvement 
Slow Time Consuming 
Messy 
Lots of Features but a Few Fell Short 
Very cute questionable dimensions of inner compartments 
Useful but not very deep 
Functional but pricey... 
I thought it would be sturdier 
Slightly Oversized 
Pretty Organization Sometimes Frustrating 
Narrower than it appears 
Expensive wherever you buy it & hard to use 
Narrow Tidy-Looking Has a Small Footprint 
As a standard cordless phone it's average 
Nice-looking commodious 
It's a pleather letter tray no more no less. 
BIC Great Erase Have their Use 
Just OK 
not dark enough 
Not so smelly but not so vivid - stick w/Black 
Good pens but a bit light. 
Colors are very light not what is shown 
Not as great as I had hoped 
Could be very handy but it isn't without flaws 
Handy but not that exciting 
Post-its in a paper dispenser 
It's fine but nothing special 
handy -- but is it really necessary? 
Don't really use it too much... 
Overrated 
Maybe for Post-It die-hard fans? 
Works ... but ... WHHYYY???? 
Fair To Middlin' 
Neat concept but... 
Does what it says 
Cute but hard to use 
Fun but not particularly practical 
Like the idea 
Just when you thought they had done all they can with sticky notes 
There's not much to say;  it's a post it note + dispenser 
Not that useful 
Fun product a million applications not enough post-its in a pack 
OK product 
It's OK. 
Nice post-its but I don't use them very often. Quite pointless in the electronic age 
Good idea not so great execution. 
Difficult delivery system 
Well-designed but could be more durable 
Hmmm....fairly flimsy and missed the mark 
It's Post-It Notes 
Great idea that loses value for mobile travelers and budget minded users 
Hard to refill horrible colors sticky residue 
Great notes but not necessary 
I Just Don't Get It 
Nothing to write home about 
...a great idea nonetheless 
Good for a cubicle 
Different but not better. 
Okay but get's used up real fast 
Not bad but a little disappointing 
Convenient but unnecessary 
They're Okay 
Just OK 
Maybe useful for somebody 
Just ok. 
Slightly Convenient but not worth the effort 
dispensing is nice limited applications 
I like the table top not the hand dispenser 
Useful and convenient in limited application 
Get the Refillable Deskgrip Dispenser -- Not This One 
I like the handband dispenser... 
I think I'll stick with my old desktop tape dispenser 
Very convenient for Christmas Eve. 
Kind of neat Kind of a pain... 
A tale of two tape dispensers: one I liked;  the other not so much 
Eh. Kind of awkward 
ingenious tabletop dispenser but wrist dispensers lacking 
good not great with too many flaws for me to buy again 
Good for quick jobs nice multi pack 
ok- doesn't roll 
I coulda' been a Five Star contender .... 
More like 792 Labels -- Good Quality Though... 
good labels 
Okay but not great. Too thin! 
Does the job 
Great product just over-priced 
Yes these are temporary labels 
Nice idea for more uses of the Post-It Notes. 
Hard to peel off the pad! 
Faint Praise From a Post-It Addict 
Fine for temporary labeling 
Great quick little labels but not a replacement for a label maker 
Worked great on some surfaces but not others 
Too sticky for me 
Good Labels 
Sticks 
Ok good inks 
Too Heavy for Road Warriors/Bad with Receipts 
disappointing 
Perfect for small messages. Packaging Issue 
Message & Note Board 
Serviceable gets the job done 
Milky pens cheap feel to it. 
Not the quality I was expecting 
It's good for attention-getting notes 
not as nice as expected 
Pretty colors pop on black background 
A little hard to read 
Kind of fun for a change of pace 
Better in Theory Than Practice [3.5 Stars] 
Good product but colors fade 
Mostly same old same old 
Average quality; nothing special 
A decent set. 
These work well enough 
More than I needed..... 
Brown is the New Green 
Kraft Paper Cover Stains Easily 
Very eco-friendly but not as functional or sturdy as I'd like ... 
Has Potential! 
Love the feel. 
Sturdy Brown Notebook Made of Mostly Recycled Materials; Can Not Be Customized; There are No Storage Pockets! 
Recycled goodness.  Basic functionality. 
Not a heavy duty cover 
Stripped Down But Stylish 
Over-priced and over-hyped - its a binder 
Recycled material and fun option for customization 
Ok binder good starting point. 
Nice But Pricey 
Nice that they are recycled 
Darling but thin 
Nice look but... 
One time use 
It's Ok for an HP 
Some intriguing new features but not everything you'd want; quality is fine for ordinary use but not professional 
Conflicts with Sony 
VERY NICE  FOR THE  PRICE ! 
Doesn't last as long as I'd like... 
Slightly Tight Fit 
Board good Pen bad. 
Mine won't stick :-( 
Get a different marker 
Awesome boards dud marker 
Convenient but there are flaws 
Only one sticks... 
Great concept 
Don't stick well small writing surface 
Great idea.  But there are a few small problems 
Not For Me 
Perfect for memos but one board can't be used out of the box 
Great Little Magnets Not So Good Marker 
Functional solidly built but marker will need to be replaced 
Ink is just too expensive. We are suckers buying these products but we don't have a choice. 
Very expensive 
ALL ink is outrageous! 
TOO DANG HIGH 
Portable 
eco friendly but skimpy 
Just Okay 
Seems expensive for what it is 
So-so notebook 
A bit too light for my tastes 
ku-jaku (Peacock) 
Gorgeous blue....extremely wet!  Test with your paper first! 
It tapes 
Good tape.  Holder sometimes doesn't hold. 
not superior to the usual 
Nothing really new 
Kind of average ink jet printer at this price range. 
Good scanner but why does scanning require ink?! 
Could have been better 
Good not great pencil sharpener 
Blast from the past 
Sharpens well but no instructions 
Just got 
A basic notebook 
It's paper. 
Very thin & flimsy cardboard front and back 
The Most Basic of Notebooks 
OK 
Not the usual Mead quality. 
Standard Notebooks Decently Priced 
Fine but nothing special. 
Good paper quality perforated pages fall out. 
Not as Good as the Older Ones 
So-So Spiral Notebooks 
Hefty notebook but poor paper quality 
Not sure who would use it. 
Lots of pages but week spiral 
Just too bulky for me 
The cloth accents and lack of a tri-fold design makes this NOT the Trapper Keeper I recall 
Same Simple Design From When I was a Kid 
Adequate at best 
but it's like after 30 years 
OK for medium-duty use 
Not all that secure 
Weak Binder Rings Overall Good Lightweight System 
Rings are awkward for me to use comes with paper graph paper dividers and handout & pen holders 
Useful 
Those rings gotta go 
Good files but bad closing mechanism. 
Nice Pocket File but with one major ergonomic issue (adding/removing documents) 
The actual product is fine 
Harder and more brittle than I was expecting 
Fine.  Sturdy.  Exactly what you'd expect. 
Nice file 
Limited Expansion 
Average Binder 
They'll slap on the 5-star onto anything anymore 
A Little Overpriced ... 
Asset is pocket cover the rest is nothing special 
I would trade the clearview cover for interior pockets 
Clunky spine design 
Versatile but Questionable Durability 
Eh I'm Not Feeling This One... 
Flexible 
Weak Binder Rings Overall Good Lightweight System 
An interesting idea that I didn't like in practice 
A Binder for Those Who Don't Like Binders 
Thoughts from a lefty 
HP satisfies again 
Not the Best purchase

Good but very expensive 
It does a good job.

Great product but the price is a gouge. Hence the 3 star review. 
Ink Prints Great! 
As advertised. 
Ink 
printer ink

Good product but outrageously priced. 
Incomplete 
Still too expensive 
Nice to have a value pack; not a better deal than the Sophia Global alternative ink cartridges. 
Works with MG8220 
Basic functionality but not basic pricing. 
Thin it works.

Mostly clean cut but no easy guides 
Only for basic needs

Works like a charm until it the wire breaks. 
Cheap and Slightly Useful 
It functions really well but some gripes 
I'll Stay Faithful to My Old-School Trimmer 
Solid standard small-business unit 
Good Hardware Suffers from Poor Software 
Good for basic stuff 
Typical Office Chair 
Expected More for the $ 
Sturdy heavy post-it dispenser 
LOVE IT! 
Somewhat helpful 
Not helpful unless you plan on carrying it with you throughout the day 
Good for people (especially children most likely) who benefit from visual aids 
Nice look probably not necessary though. 
Could be better... 
Too much board for one day 
A little advanced for my weight loss goals 
Limitations! 
... 
I like this meal planner 
Good visual workout journal 
Good for people (especially children most likely) who benefit from visual aids 
It does its job but it's nothing special 
Biggest Loser No There is Some Value Here 
Good idea but too big. 
I'm not that impressed 
It's a dry erase board 
Good as a Reminder 
Works for it's purpose but too disposable after that 
Expo White Board with a pre-printed chart 
Great for a workout! 
Not that motivating 
Good Printer - Freezes after long periods of time - No AirPrint 
Progress or regress? 
Slow But With Some Good Features. A BASIC Printer. 
Okay printer 
Basic Scanner. 
A reliable all in one printer 
Thicker not always the best. 
Thick not too sticky 
The roll is really small 
not save much 
No better than others I've used 
Looks good punches great stores well... but I hate to empty it 
Paperpro 3-Hole Punch 
My heart was moved the holes were not. 
Cuts well waste removal not so much 
Doesn't contain punched holes securely 
Lightweight 
Good 
disappointed 
so so with my mac 
Good but could be much better 
Disappointing right out of the box... 
Good printer but too long installation 
Average quality with poor software 
Capable but not well refined 
It's a toss up between this or the Canon MX870 
Excellent Value but Driver Issues 
It works 
keeps it cool but... 
Not opaque 
Hard to straighten out 
Good Quality 
Very Nice Matt but supplier needs to improve their packaging 
Go ahead and add $50 to the price tag. 
Not the greatest 
Not half bad.... 
Middle of the pack 
Great printer - if you have a PC 
a little expensive.  Compatibles work just as good. 
Good but over Priced 
can only load about 5 pages at a time 
Good cheap printer 
I agree...this printer uses a lot of ink..welcome surprise (see my 4/30 update) 
Summary for Mac Users only....good printer overall 
Wireless with touchscreen and apps but issues reduce its rating - UPDATED 2013 
Questionable for small business 
Strange Combination 
Meh 
Cheaper than ordering from warehouse stores 
Same taped together bags as reviewer logan 
Oh Well... 
Good product for the price 
ITS ALIVE ! 
Attractive but does not stand the test 
Good printer for the price 
You get what you pay for 
Bought it for the HP Reputation 
Not good for wireless printing 
The \Alien Creature\ printer... 
Wireless but not much more to offer 
Not recommended for Mac users 
Larger label area...but will you see it? 
Don't see the point of the gianormous tab; but nice for GTD 
A step down from my old office chair but for the price it's all right. 
Nice in photos but dissapointing in reality 
Really won't work well with mac wirelessly 
Great for home computer not so great for tablet 
Received this printer about three hours ago 
Three Stars 
IMPORTANT - Google Voice Support Ends May 15 2014

Small tabs 
Strong Smelling Plastic 
Avery Erasable Mini Tab Dividers 
Durability of Plastic

No more or less comfortable 
A few drawbacks..but otherwise ok 
Nice enough dividers the labeling process is a bit drawn out though 
Great Dividers Hard to Get Right Printer Labels 
Sturdy overcomplicated 
Sizing off for Covey planning systems 
good label maker 
Small and fast but poor print quality and limited tape size 
There Are Better Label Makers 
Easy to use cartridges pricey 
Dymo Label Problems 
It Makes Labels: Computer Required! 
MINI Binder.  Small size:  5 1/2 x 8 1/2  Just ok... 
Specialty sized which limits use. 
Ok as a binder pocket is impractical 
Nice Enough Odd Size 
Nice little binder but nothing special 
Hold It! 
Caution - filler paper is hard to find 
Nice useful item but doesn't close evenly. 
Decent Small Size Binder 
Odd size 
MATEIN-OFFICE 
Doesn't last very long. 
Not A Shred Of Evidence That This Is Up To Fellowes Quality 
Ummmm maybe my unit is broken?  But it has trouble doing 3+ pages... 
has limitations 
It Makes Labels: Difficult to Read Screen! 
How to measure your size for this chair. Not for someone very short or very tall. 
Average Low Cost Chair 
With a name like basyx... 
My LEAST Favorite Chair By Hon-But OK. 
Nice looking chair soft leather? affordable and easy assembly 
Overall Good Few Problems 
Love the screen hate the computer 
Nice features but frustrating to use 
For the money this is a good chair. 
Greedy for ink 
Bulky monochrome lacking features 
Does the Job 
uncomfortable to hold 
Not as good as other Jetstream pens 
Not as good as.... 
a nice pen overall but I prefer a thicker line a softer point 
You Have to Scribble on Scratch paper to Get it Going 
Nice pens but more of a ballpoint 
Not bad not great. 
Still smears and doesn't write on glass or sideways. 
Just Another Rollerball Pen 
What can you say about a pen? 
High points and low points 
They write ok 
Good But Nothing To WRITE Home About 
Longer 
Not as good as some of my other gel rollerball pens 
Needs a stronger suction cup 
Portable project helper 
good idea but 
Not really one-handed 
Limited use and awful mac software. 
Mixed Review 
Great at first 
Do not judge the chair on the first day alone. 
Okay office chair 
All the bells and whistles but still like my basic fellows P600C better 
I personally love to shred documents it might even be a fetish... 
convenience limited by small bin bad design slow speed 
Nice for letter-sized paper but struggles with non-standard sizes 
Not worth $200 but great concept otherwise 
Only good for flat non-stapled paper 
Frequent jams 
Swingline Stack & Shred Hands Free Shredder 
Good at What it Does but Plenty it Doesn't Do 
Handles 60 sheets at a go (sometimes depends) 
Interesting - clever idea not sold on the execution 
Has Quirks 
When it works it's great... 
Shredder works as advertised but temperamental 
Doesn't work as promised .. 
ok 
I prefer the Staples Springloader 
Arrived not assembled properly. 
Doesn't staple flat 
lookwise is good 
Useful but has some design flaws 
Super-light touch light-duty stapler best for anyone who can't use a normal stapler 
Decent compact stapler 
A functional stapler with mediocre aesthetics. Some confusion about what staples it requires. 
Not quite as promised 
It came with no staples and I never could get the thing to work! 
Pretty but I prefer the classic Swingline 
ok stapler 
Swingline SmartTouch Stapler is so so 
A light use stapler that the students love to use 
I don't love it. 
I do not recommend this 
It's okay - My preference is a regular stapler 
A good idea with some flaws 
Weird highlighter. 
These are okay but I guess I'm a traditionalist highlighter user 
A Highlighter That Sure Is Different 
I'm not overly thrilled. 
Low-Lighters 
Like highlighting with a crayon 
Bright but thick 
Novel idea soft feel highlighter but not really much of a highlighter 
Nice but not great 
Gel Highlighters they aren't your parents' office tools 
Good Product - Limited Appeal 
It is fine but not as solid as I would like. 
Over Whelmed by the Keyboard Tray 
Heavy. Good length. Installation not as easy. 
keyboard tray 
Heavy duty to a fault 
Good but not great 
Decent product but value? Not so sure. 
Quick and Simple 
Happy Holidays 
Attractive convenient expensive 
Unimpressed 
Failed to Interest 
Decent but not as good as some of the other brands we've tried 
Not  bad but not my first choice in workbook for kids 
Didn't hold interest 
Currently doesn't compare on price or performance with the Fellowes W11-C 
High price reduces its value 
This shredder is an 'okay' product 
Not bad but missing the \auto on\ feature. 
Swingline Paper Shredder - Good quality but pricey 
A cut above...in some ways 
not so great 
Ok but not great. 
OK but 
Ink Takes Too Long To Dry And Smears Easily 
Smudgy and they bled over my hands 
Like the pen not the mess 
Worked well but I did have one blowout 
Nice but not as smooth as stated 
average quality 
writes very smoothly a little messy 
Writes smooth but is a bit gloopy. 
Nice Feel but Has a Few Problems 
Not my favorite BIC 
Sometimes a pen is just a pen 
Nothing special 
Too thin! 
Decorated Bic Pen 
Prefer regular BIC Cristal pens 
I couldn't resist... 
Works Fine But Is Just A Pen 
Just a pen. 
Seems to me it's just a thinner pen than the \regular\ version 
Too thin; plastic is cheap 
Prefer the Original 
What's the point? 
Decent pen 
skinny pens 
More specialty pens please Bic! 
Really Now We Have Separate Mens and Womens Pens! 
Slender pretty and smooth-writing 
But what are they? 
not bad 
Multi Part Review 
Great Idea But Not For Heavy Lamination 
Staples pages no good for bulletin boards hard to load staples 
Better Staplers Available... 
Light Weight Handy Little Stapler ! 
Just ok. 
As a vine reviewer 
Works well but has design flaws. 
Okay but not perfect 
50/50 !!! 
Too lazy to complain. 
Fellowes Bankers Box easy to put together 
Nothing Special 
Good for a gel pen but I'll stick with my Zebra ballpoint retractable. 
Not as mightier than a sword 
Writes well 
Nice Art/Testing Pencil..but some lose their grip with time.. 
Lovely line uncomfortable grip poor lead handling 
Great Pencil! Update: the lead constantly needs to be pushed down! 
Can't use headphones with these phones! 
Good but not great. Read Update 
Power supply problems... 
USB Cable Not Included 
Have a work around now.  (formerly Good for PCs Bad for Macs) 
Can be wired or wireless but not both:  wireless eliminates scanning 
Good for Windows users. Not so good for Mac users. 
Good all in one printer but not a photo printer 
Multi-Function With Some Malfunction 
OUTSTANDING functionality.  Not so stellar print quality. 
Some great features but some really annoying ones too 
Unimpressed 
Installation Was A Huge Headache But Not a Bad Printer Once Working 
Decent but not great basic inkjet printer 
Persnickety little machine 
Great idea that just doesn't hold up... 
Great Idea in Theory But of Limited Use in Practice. 
Overpriced 
Just okay 
Repositionable and strong 
Very handy for clearing up paper clutter 
flat 
Good with flaws 
So far so good... but anticipating problems 
sturdy 
Need more room! 
could be really useful but doesn't store much 
Interesting Idea 
Nice Idea But Flawed Design Makes For Limited Use - Sometimes Bigger IS Better... 
Useful but no help for the organizationally-challenged 
OK 
Durable but pricey 
cheaper options for your printer 
Acceptable Not Great 
Great Printer -- Rip-off on Ink Supplies 
Good but some problems especially with a Mac 
A word of warning 
Horrible set up.  Meh quality. 
Lovely Colors and Patterns 
Divided Fancy But Not Especially Sturdy 
Beautiful Design But Flimsy 
Lovely but Somewhat Thin 
Surprisingly Thin Index Dividers with Psychedelic Vibrating Colors that Hurt My Eyes 
Only if you love the design and need not touch them often are these a good option 
Pretty patterns but very thin 
Attractive but flimsy. 
A little thin 
Cute Not Top Quality 
Pricey for paper 
pretty but very flimsy 
Pretty But Far Flimsier than Expected 
Useless Pocket 
Very stylish but not particularly functional ... 
No Pockets - Bummer 
Pretty but sadly flawed... 
Eco friendly 
A Nice Looking Reasonably Priced Binder With Several Flaws 
5 star if you have large desk 
Not a standout but not too bad either 
Will Love it If you don't need the interior pockets... 
Its okay 
Looks can be deceiving 
A little pricey 
Pretty for home use. 
Understated Binder For Work But Comes With Warning 
3.5*  \It was the Best of Binders; It was the So-So of Binders.\ (with apologies to Dickens) 
Seems pricy but it's quite nice 
Flimsy 
Sturdy. Lightweight. Potentially Toxic. 
Looks good but some quality control issues and seems a bit pricey for what you get.  Not sure about that Prop 65 warning... 
Wilson Jones Recycled Bliss Binder 1\ 
Okay but No choice in Design 
Cute but Extremely Stiff 
Could be improved 
Pretty binder 
This is an adequate binder of its type 
Nice Enough But Not Worth 8.00 
Love the style but the execution is subpar 
nice but... 
Lovely binder 
Cute cheap binder 
Some Nice Qualities Some Less So [3.5 Stars] 
Pretty but stiff 
Not what I expected 
Definitely easier to use but requires special staples 
Heavy duty could not use with regular staples 
Five-star stapler handicapped by an inability to use regular staples! 
Not the best not the worst 
Laser pointer works great but wireless remote isn't compatible with Windows 8.1 
It's okay 
does it have to be this big? 
It's not too terrible... 
Quiet easy to use 
I'm Trying to be Fair Here but... 
A good quality that must meet market pricing 
Strong folders but the sliding tab??? 
Motorized Sharpener requires 2 AA batteries 
Works but not with confidence 
Cute little doodad gizmo thing but not as good as it should be. 
Manual vs. Battery Powered 
With a little effort it does the job 
Grip is nice but pen is nothing special 
For portability and quick easy scans a bit pricy. 
Cute Yet Heavy 
need LOTS of room on your desk for this good for teens 
Love Notes 
Cute but pretty big! 
Not really sure this has much use 
writes excellent erases okay! 
Best erasable pens on the market BUT ... 
Nice pens but thought they were refillable.  Will probably not buy again. 
Small and cheap 
Random frame color is ridiculous 
Servicable but cheap 
Handy little whiteboard for the office home school etc... 
Not a big fan 
Nothing special 
Inexpensive lightweight and functional. 
okay 
What you see 
Quartet Magnetic Whiteboard 
Fine but nothing special 
Weak magnets hurt an otherwise decent product 
General advice is to lubricate shredder cutters from time to time 
Nice product but not economical 
Brother TN 450 compatible 
Out with the old in with the new... 
HP creates massive confusion with their numbering system 
good ink 
Be sure you understand what \magnetic\ means . . . 
Desktop Realestate or mouse pad? 
Massively massive mousepad 
The Dually of Mouse Pads 
For Decoration More Than for Practical Use 
Too small to be very useful 
Works well but has limited applications. 
Limited Use 
Mediocre 
Okay but they stick together (minor curling too) 
Can't do much better or the price 
A mix of great and not so great. 
Returned Second Set 
Good 
Two Out Of Five Handsets Defective After Less Than Two Years 
Busted speakerphone great range uses standard AAA NiMH batteries outstanding audio quality 
Works well but a really a bit out of date already. 
Phone review 
Needs More Space 
Not so useful for keeping track of schoolwork 
Well made cramped for space 
Love this calculator.... I loved it until 
Uniden Quality Has Dropped 
Cool designed product that will look great on your desk although not completely functional... 
Too big too shiny too bulky--but it works just fine 
Just OK 
Watch the weight limits and the old paint! 
Not Strong Enough 
Could have been awesome if they had done it right. 
Too Much...And Too Little 
Nice phone but no easy way to screen calls 
Just Average 
These are ok... 
Works Well does Not Dry Out 
Great applicator but glue dries a bit cloudy and white 
Not Really Crazy About the New Packaging 
Does what you want it to do - with greater ease due to the applicator 
Designed for convenient reuse while sacrificing strength 
Handy for sequins and flatbacks 
Great idea but they could use some improvements 
Lots of colors and handy brush tips 
Regular Sharpies work Much Better! 
Easy to use but watch what you use it on! 
Disappointing results 
Good product but it was the wrong model # 
Nice design and features; good sound quality (at low volumes) poor range 
Okay \Sticky\ keys 
OK but Panasonic equivalent is better 
Nice Cordless Phone But 
Good Phone System. Excellent Sound Quality. 
looking for a cheap phone 
Decent pencil but not the best choice. 
Good Chair But Leatherette Material Cracked Badly After 16 Months 
WARNING: BUY A USB CABLE FIRST! 
Constantly having trouble with Mac 
The printer is excellent the supplies are expensive 
Very nice with some flaws 
Beautifully made but one major flaw - the safetly lock makes Repetition difficult! 
A little bouncy but useful 
Works well and looks nice 
bouncy. 
Not sturdy enough except for a tablet 
Office printer?  Yah right. 
Great for teen & kids 
Fairly handy... not very strong or reusable 
Works better for smaller paper products 
Nice alternative to sticky tak 
Sticky stickups 
Good for notes and postcards but not anything substantial. 
Alternate for magnets and tape 
Only work for small light objects 
Good and Cute When Used Wisely 
Sticky and good 
Works fine but needs better usage instructions 
ink cartridge 
If you can find them cheap get this one. 
Nice smooth writing pens but a little light in the hand. 
Write nicely but watch your fingers.... 
You Get What You Pay For 
Smears 
Decent pen but not top shelf 
Penned 
Fussy click mechanism good for leftys 
The ink skips! 
4 stars is maybe a little generous....maybe 3 is also too generous 
Satisfaction varies with your specific needs and expectations 
Great colors! 
Mixed feelings. 
What's the big fuzz? I don't get it 
Cute... but not really for me. 
Nice pens cool colors! 
\SMOOTH\ INK AND CONSISTENT COLORS 
Just like any normal papermate pen 
these pens write the color they are 
Great price great colors - if you like ballpoints! 
Bright colors cheap looking body 
It's a set of pens 
Light colors are always just too light 
nice 
good ink lousy pen 
Liked it serves its purpose well! 
The quality is questionable but it functions fine 
Ok post it notes but prefer the original 3M Post-Its 
These are fine - but nothing unique/innovative 
Not as good as Post It Notes 
Not sure of its usefulness has some issues 
Plastic is not good + smears with gel pens 
Good idea but be careful 
A different look and feel 
Not Sure These are Worth the Switch 
Plastic-y texture makes many pens run on this sticky note 
A teacher / graduate student review 
Great for ballpoints -- not for gel pens 
an innovation you can do without 
I can see clearly ...sorta 
Abit too transparent... needs work 
Paper vs Plastic 
Nice Idea but Not That New 
Cute accessory..but not necessary! 
Cool idea but not perfect... 
Okay depending on what you need 
Kind of a mixed bag 
Underwhelming 
By now a bit of a comodity product. 
Need better adhesive 
nice but with built-in shorts 
comparable to POST -It flags 
They're adequate. 
COULD BE STICKIER 
They just don't Stick Around 
These are Sticky Notes . . . 
Bargain basement stickies 
Works as well as Post-It Notes 
Recycled makes a good product eco friendly 
Good product but there are better ones out there 
Acceptable sticky notes but I prefer Post-Its 
Not so Sticky 
Good sticky pads but wasteful 
See-Through Sticky Notes 
Perforated Sticky Notes 
Perforated Sticky Notes 
Decent sticky notes but don't give me a reason to leave Post Its 
Up to the job 
Average 
Not Quite as Good as Post-it Notes 
Hey It's a Sticky Note OK 
Post It's a Better Value 
Fine.  Small differences from post-it notes. 
O.K. product not priced competitively 
Not To Bad But Could Be A Bit Better 
Basic 
Maybe slightly better than Post-Its 
Quite Colorful - But Not Very Sticky 
Great for Writing on 
Unnecessarily useful... 
Disappointing 
Not what I expected 
A comparison 
Fine & Useful... but nothing truly innovative 
ok for what it is 
Could be better designed... 
Product works well enough 
OK if you write tiny; otherwise too small 
Great size & paper quality but... 
Cute 
Useful for organizing shelves and files and stuff like that 
Great Idea. Not Great Material. 
Really Get Your Attention 
Limited usefulness; writing smears -- Post-it brand is better 
Clever idea but not as versatile as I would like 
Nice product but has some limitations. 
Bright but maybe see-through not such a great idea? 
Good not great 
Handy note pads but better? 
New Twist on old favorite 
Nifty idea 
OK but not my personal preference..... 
Ridges in the paper 
Ordered the wrong one 
It's paper 
Pink Pen 
I Like It But... 
Are you a printer paper aficionado? Me neither. 
Good buy 
cheap paper 
OK But No Savings. 
Decent paper grabs sometimes 
Too expensive 
Worth A Shot (and doesn't include gray) 
some work some don't 
Cheap but sticky. 
Do not purchase. 
Blazingly fast but not as user-friendly as the Fujitsu ScanSnap 
If I could figure out how to use it..... 
It Dispenses 
Compact but takes getting used to. 
Fine but not a significant improvement 
Prefer standard stickies 
Great in concept poor in execution 
Bottom adhesive is too far away from edge 
COULD BE STICKIER 
The Bottom tends to Fan Out 
Could use more or better-placed sticky 
Good concept but flawed 
Good idea just not executed well.... 
Not as cool as I thought 
Doesn't work as well as you'd think 
weak adhesive but hard to peel from the pad 
Not So Helpful Sticky Notes 
A bit too strong for regular sheets of paper 
Great for Papers Not so Good for Posting 
Nice but still needs some work 
Useful but needs more sticky 
not worth the premium in price 
A good old post-it but with a few quirks 
not quite 
If you need it - it might help but... 
LIKE my 3M Post-It Notes BETTER because they STAY FLAT ... 
Almost Lie Flat 
About as good as regular sticky notes 
The notes will curl up as soon as you take them from the pack. 
Hard to Use 
Apples to apples to sticky paper... 
cute but best for a gift 
A cute desk ornament but not for real frequent usage. 
Good but... 
Not worth the effort. 
Curling edges are a hassle but the price is right 
Pencil Sharpener a bit Small 
Decent pencil sharpener. 
Nothing Special 
Nice hand feel but lines could be cleaner. 
Looks nice feels cheap 
Okay not great not bad... 
Average 
Found myself looking for excuses to write 
Good not great 
This product doesn't age gracefully 
Half and half... 
It is a gel ink pen 
Didn't Work As Described 
A new development in book marking/note taking 
OK But Kind of Odd 
Handy all-in-one packet 
I'm Not Quite Sure What The Point Is 
Not as handy as you'd think 
Colorful! 
Rainbow of color and sizes 
Like the concept but they don't hold their \stick\ as well as Post-It Notes 
notes that stick 
EPSON R2000 / CANON PRO-10 / PRO-100 FACE OFF! 
Good overall function but no cross-shredding!!! 
Just your basic calculator 
Nice little calculator 
Easy to read numbers but just OK 
Decent 
Be Careful of the Clip 
Nice report cover but pricey 
Useful and unusual but not great. 
The clips are too hard 
Does the job but not likely for long 
Really good if keeping inside a briefcase 
Useful Design but Too Flimsy 
Decent product nothing special but it will do the job 
Useful Folders! 
Thin and to easy to bend 
Good but way too delicate. 
Great results for a low price if you can wait for the ink to dry 
It's fine but only for specific uses 
Effective enough. 
A relic from the 1960s? 
Works fine 
It works but limited usefulness 
Not so sure... 
Sharp but not as safe as others 
Safety Over Functionality 
Safer maybe but not easier 
Safe but not as effective as a utility knife or sturdy scissors... 
Works great on thin plastics terrible on durable blister packs 
Time will tell 
Where was this when my kids were little? 
Pretty cool tool... 
OK for Small Jobs 
poor version of a box cutter 
Too Lightweight 
Needs a bigger blade. 
So-so 
Almost Better Than a Razor Blade 
Ooh a Box Cutter 
Pretty good for the price 
Quality label but not the normal ease of use that I am used to with Avery. 
Labels are good Avery templates so-so 
Cuts well but exposed cutting edge could slice little fingers 
Decent printer quirky. 
Too Bulky 
Attractive yes but a bit awkward 
Cute by not easy to load 
Design is superb but removes functionality. 
Colors off on photo printing 
So far so good but... 
not good for art pencils 
Stylish pretty comfortable with some reservations 
HON Abandons Quality 
not so impressed.. it's okay 
Elegant look...  disappointing features 
Looks Great But Lacks Quality 
thin padding and oddly proportioned 
Make sure this is what you want before you get it 
Sleek and firm but it is not leather. 
Would be much better on casters 
Good phone but dated design 
Expensive and not that great 
Better than the tab markers 
not what i thought 
Works well but will drain your wallet with ink costs 
Does everything really well but the ink use is highway robbery 
Scanner died within months 
Not overly impressed but they work for my purposes 
colors are off 
Not what I expected. 
Works As Described but Not Reusable or Permanent 
Easy to Use 
Product is so-so design and print online service is great 
Read the small print... Tips for use & a couple recommendations that work better for you 
Not as expected 
It's a basic label sheet with adhesive back/border 
Nice looking little signs but don't print to edge on all printers 
Would like to see bigger shelf tags 
my fault 
A good little copier/printer with one hesitation 
Great for pictures but not the printer to use for routine office work 
This printer is a bad mamma jamma! 
Good fast prints not so good interface 
Couldn't Get It To Work On My Network 
Not bad but has design flaws. 
The software drives me crazy 
Quiet Fast All-in -One 
Be Careful Mac Users 
Great quality and easy to use! 
Do you copy? 
A bit too big for an inkjet machine 
Great printer! - UPDATED 3 YEARS LATER - LEAKS INK 
Look great alignment is problematic 
Okay hard at first 
Something like greeting cards meet stickers 
good labels but templates may be an issue for some people 
Okay but.... 
Avery 
nice labels but templates only work with Microsoft Word 
Some tricks to using... 
Product itself is great but creating labels can be a challenge 
Great idea challenging to produce 
Ok not great. 
sort of flimsy 
Not as easy as I thought it would be to use 
About what I expected 
Can be a challenge to attach labels to bags 
Fantastic for small food businesses bake sales and avid cooks 
Prints nicely but has some limitations 
Not impressed 
Anticipation.... 
Great labels but awful Mac software support 
Templates Need Work 
Good Product Needs Better Templates 
Round stickers are brown 
Decent Lables But Nothing Special 
Another Good Avery Product But Could Be Improved On 
Nice albeit small arched and textured labels but the template support could be better 
A decent all-in-one for the home office 
Epson WorkForce 845 Wireless Color Printer 
A firmware update improved this printer.  :-) 
Nice not great. 
Just An Ok Printer. You Wont Be Impressed 
Glaring problems prevent the Epson 645 from being recommended 
Epson WorkForce 645 Wireless Printer with Scanner Copier and Fax (C11CB86201) 
Thirsty as a sailor on shore leave slower than molasses in January 
The price clinches it for me 
Not a bad inkjet printer but don't believe the high print volume hype. 
Hits the basics but I expected more 
Excellent Quality Fast Printing - UPDATED 
No bad but not great 
So many features so many options... maybe too many & printing subpar 
Easy labels iffy fonts 
Lots of features Still not a P-Touch 
Nice product but no thanks on the expense 
Better than Brother PT1290 
A good labeler but not great. 
OK 
More complex isn't always better 
Efficient but the UI could use some work.. 
Works well enough 
Decent label maker; when it is working 
Fine for a Presentation BUT Not Particularly Durable & NO VELCRO 
Protection of documents on travel 
Flimsy Like The Paper You Put In; No Velcro 
Nice for Documents But Not Very Sturdy 
Pretty flimsy 
Decent product but should come reinforced in some areas.

Thin/Flimsy But Acceptable 
Standard Manila files 
Helpful but not unusual 
It's just what it looks like - 9 regular file folders and a sheet of blank labels 
Eight dollars for nine file folders? 
It's OK 
You are paying for the look not the quantity. 
Really?  It's simply a marketing ploy save your hard earned dollars. 
The glass is either half-empty or half-full depending on your perspective.

Smead MO Filing Starter Kit... MO = my organizer 
Good for basic file keeping

Nothing special... 
Nine folders labels tips 
Better than your everyday standard file folder! 
GOOD PROS BUT CONS AS WELL 
Good Organizer does not stand up on its own 
Inexpensive light weight 12 pocket organizer. 
Good product but an organizer is only as organized as its owner 
Clear window broke within a week 
Neat folder not exceptional 
Well designed could be better a bit expensive. 
Not For Me 
insanely bright blue instead of navy as pictured but otherwise an okay folder

Limited usefulness and inconsistent results... 
Nice idea but doesn't work as well as it should. 
Cute little gadget 
Great design idea less effective practical tool 
Sometimes Works Great Others Frustrating 
Overall nice...but not quite what I expected 
It's ok 
Definitely a uni-tasker but does its job well 
New Westcott Scissors Mouse Is Useful !! 
Not for lightweight paper 
Bit of a learning curve on this one!

Good idea but not that useful for me 
Great concept but too hard to learn 
Best For The Kids 
Works Under Some Conditions 
Takes some getting used to 
Great idea but be careful 
It works but you have to know how to use it 
Good for only a small subset of what plain ol' scissors can do 
A product that works but is not as convenient as scissors 
Cuts well but (perhaps) limited use 
Its good but does add bulk to your wallet 
Average product 
Not much \higher\ capacity 
Nice printer not completely wireless

Curled up on edges 
Could be better 
Great Idea. Disappointing Product. 
OK but Kind of Gimicky 
A little disappointing 
Handy 
Nice but not necessarily necessary 
Good concept but falls short 
Love the idea--but it's got limitations! 
does what you expect but $5 seems very expensive for what you get

Not quite perfect 
Windows Only Alternative To Fujitsu S1300i 
Some minor inconveniences but still a decent scanner 
Not Quite Ready For Primetime 
An interesting alternative to the Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300i 
Looks nice so-so quality 
Quality is fine but the black border really cuts down on the usable space and the picture is misleading. 
Don't expect 
Love it 
Arrived warped 
DON'T TRUST THE PICTURE.  Usable cork surface only about 13\ x 8\ 
Too Small 
This a nice lightweight cork board that is in a convenient ... 
Too small to be functional 
smaller than advertised 
Looks nice but large frame makes it less functional 
Smaller than you probably want 
Great as a Memory Board! 
Frame is larger than it appears in the picture 
Stylish stapler but not the usual swingline quality 
Cheap 
Functional Stapler 
fun color but definitely only good for the occasional user 
Waste of money 
Works fine but not ideal for a frequent stapler. 
Functional light weight stapler for personal use - BUT! no starter staples included 
A fine light duty inexpensive stapler (if you don't pay list price). 
Not sturdy but stands out 
Not that impressed 
Not Your Grandma's Swingline 
It's okay looks good feels flimsy 
Decent compact stapler 
Very Dissapointing 
Reasonably Good 
Ok for a small printer I still prefer Epson's WorkForce brand 
Can be realllllly slow 
Pretty good 
A very basic multi-function printer. 
It's an Epson. If you like them you'll like this one.

ink loves to bleed even with fast writing. 
Not overly impressed 
Comfortable pen but drags on paper 
Nothing to Write Home About 
Dark & Mysterious Colors Poor Ink Coverage

OK for minimal shredding volume 
BASIC PAPER CLIPS

Price blows avery out of the water but watch out for printer compatibility

It doesn't work on my network nice scanning claims about touch and cost 
Nice printer flawed scan capabilities expensive ink 
Works great on the network BUT...

Runs out of black ink way too fast 
THIS THING IS MADE TO WASTE INK!! 
EXTREMELY user friendly interface but not perfect 
It's decent but not sure of value for price...

There is better for the same cost. 
Overall pretty good printer with a few quirks

Ink is very costly

Interesting But  . . . 
Odd Chair ... Mixed Results ... 
Quirky chair 
Cute and easy to assemble 
Comfortable and stable. 
As advertised and easy to put together with one problematic design flaw 
Meh 
More expensive reliable 
This is not the photo black cartridge plus it's an okay price. 
How Am I Using Ink This Fast!?!? 
Like I have a lot of choices... 
It runs out quickly. 
Not seller's fault but............

Sturdy and functional but not perfect 
A Few Improvements Over Its Predecessor (The MA220MB) But Not As Aesthetically Appealing And Has Durability Issues 
Good quality but \easy adjust\ is a bit of a stretch 
Very very well made...but get the other one 
It's a good idea 
Interesting organizing concept - good paper from a well-known company 
Useful but not incredibly convenient 
It's okay 
Better than I expected 
Grossly overpriced 
Not sure of the advantage 
Amazing But Expensive 
Good idea poor execution 
Quality just OK nice idea but .... 
Works a little too well paper is very thin 
You are paying for convenience 
More of a pad of paper than a clipboard 
A regular old clipboard is much better 
Interesting Idea With Flaws 
Just OK 
They are not Cannon ink. They are not bad though and they are soooo cheap! 
So - So Price is Right 
They're pens... 
Pilot Work Force Retractable Pen 
Large sturdy pen 
It's okay. Kind of a novelty thing. 
Just a little too big... 
Not impressed - cheap feel ugly clip slippery grip 
OK 
OK pen in terms of function 
Good if this is your kind of pen expensive if it isn't 
Not sure how practical this is 
Pen works 
Good pen but design could be better 
Clunky 
So Close but Not Quite 
It doesn't live  up to the claim 
the colors aren't particularly bright or vibrant 
OK But I Would Prefer a Softer Grip! 
more water resistant than Pilot G2 but writes less smoothly 
Just okay 
Not as smooth as I'd hope. 
Flimsy and easily bent 
Large and Economic 
Works OK but maybe not enough ink? 
Good printer no wifi built-in and expensive toner 
It's Okay 
Several things draw the rating down here... 
Positive first impression so far but \return imaging unit\ a little worrisome 
Not as many features as the competition but still a solid basic printer 
Very good not great 
110 negatives. 
VERY easy method to convert your old photos to digital 
Average Stapler in Pretty Wrapping. 
Nice appearance works fine. 
Attractive 
Looks good but doesn't staple any better

Does as promised 
Might Have a Dud-Keep Receipt for 10 yr. Warranty 
Works pretty well 
Made In China - Poorly 
Nice but with some annoying flaws 
No AirPrint 
Good Choice if You Don't Have to Have Color 
Still not Laser 
Won't Replace my laser printer but makes a great standard printer 
Good printer but 
Is this REALLY an affordable alternative to a laser printer? 
The tray sucks but it prints nice 
Good quality photos but a monochrome laser might be more suitable if you print mostly text. 
For the price good value but lacks the bells and whistle. 
Good printer but please Epson make OSX installation easy 
Monochrome Printer with a HUGE Ink Cartridge 
There are better Epson products 
Compact single-purpose black ink inkjet printer 
Fine but nothing special 
Can't Get the Wi-Fi Working 
Am I missing an important point? 
I'm not sure what these are for I thought they were binders for letters. 
Just plastic sheets 
Just plain 8 1/2 x 11 (7mil) Polyethylene (PET) sheets. 
Pictures can be deceiving&#8230; but still a great plastic cover for your docs 
pictures are misleading 
Not entirely as advertised 
Not Bad 
Easy to use . . . 
Sharpens great but you're going to have to hold it down 
Ok 
Works OK for a portable 
I am on the fence - It does work 
Compact Size with a few problems 
Westcott iPoint Ball Pencil Sharpener (15570) 
It works 
Interesting product...plenty of uses just don't use too many 
Interesting Novelty but Expensive 
Its big in size but not on stick 
Good for limited use; not sticky enough. 
OK not sure there's any practical use for this product 
Great product that I've been finding a ton of uses for but the adhesive isn't quite strong enough. 
Great except for one thing 
Be Sure you Need Only Single Function! Choose carefully. 
Bend Over When Buying Ink 
Paper get Messed Up 
SLOW not always user-friendly one-trick pony w pricey consumables per unit print costs 
Good product recommended for photo printing very slow. 
Excellent prints but Set-up was frustrating for me 
Lot of plastic pricey (Canon only) ink noisy and limited features 
Op System Problems. 
Not Vanilla Manila 
A nice idea to help you relabel and reuse manila folders needs improvement 
Well... 
Read the small print 
can only use specific pens and erasers 
Great idea 
Not so erasable... 
For the environmentally conscious - reuse reuse reuse 
Very easy set up quite handy for documents image quality lacking compared to other scanners on photographs however. 
Comparison of the P-208 with the Cannon P-215 
It doesn't fare well when compared to my Doxie GO personal scanner... 
Great Quality (But Expensive) 
great tape at a really high price but some care can help 
Odd \Tape\ 
Not as good as competing products 
cool red tape for packing or marking things red. 
Works ok 
Watch where you stick it! 
mainly good for resealing easy opening and closing 
Decent deterrent if you apply more tape over the top of it 
Most of the Manufacturer claims for this security tape for lightweight envelopes and mailers tested true but one did not 
not for sealing 
Helps to supplement heavy duty long lasting packing tape 
With Reservations 
This message tape works best if used UNDER the clear thick packing tape. 
It would be ok if the description didn't say high adhesion and holding power 
Easy to Realign 
not very sticky 
Barely sticks to a box.  Not good for security or anything else. --- Edited and upgraded from 1 to 3 stars 
Alert tape for tampered package - not useful as a packaging tape 
Adhesive is too light for box sealing 
Okay but Could Use Some Improvement 
Barely adequate for intended purpose when used alone 
A little fragile 
Not as strong as expected. 
Good for warning not for sealing. 
Thin Box Sealing Tape 
Thin easily tangled tape 
Ok 
great for labeling but NOT for your primary tape 
Could be thicker 
Truly a Label Not a Sealer 
To Enhance Your Taping Not for Primary Taping 
Sticky 
Did I get a bad batch? 
Doesn't last long 
Could be much better 
Did Not Impress This Pen Snob 
Your Favorite Black Ink Pen With A Colored Squiggly Line Case 
Black pens 
Great picture quality but questionable security 
the mystery pooper remains at large 
Not the most sensible product. 
Great quality OK with my printer 
I wanted to like this more.... 
This product solves a problem that I don't have but if I did... 
Notepad for iPhone 
Wish both sides had been lined would have been a better value 
Moderately functional but nothing special 
You are paying for convenience 
Really? 
Neat idea 
nothing special but good size notepad for a purse. 
Noteworthy Note Taking 
Okay...Whatever 
Nice idea needs improvement 
Good idea buggy app 
Worked fine for me but not worth the cost. 
It is a note pad 
Does what I need it to do but there is no iPad app... 
It' ok.. 
Don't last too long 
Be careful when opening or ink will get on you 
Smead Organized UP Heavyweight File Folders: Things are looking UP 
Good... useful... but not as great as expected 
Good Concept Needs Some Changes 
Don't put them in a backpack! 
Very odd file folders... 
Nice images but missing something. 
decent printer but a real pain to set up 
good product for an ALL in ONE 
Some good; some bad 
my first disapointment from Canon 
Prints and scans well but won't print without a power cycle after it goes to sleep 
Great price you get what you pay for watch the wording of the product features they may lead you to wrong conclusions 
I was hoping for more. 
Good enough but I liked the MX 850 better 
Solid Printer with Good Features but Some Negatives 
Lift 'Em High 
Learning to leave a fingerprint 
Not what I thought it was from the picture 
Difficult to dispense works just fine 
Works fine in some cases 
Not as easy to use as flat sheets not sure why you would choose this instead. 
Great hardware 
Pen-o-holic's Perspective: Poor Man's Gelly Rolls (Almost) [3.5 Stars] 
Not as good as Sakura but some are ok 
3+ is more realistic 
Not the best 
So.... 
Okay Pens 
Every color you can think of. 
Rainbow on a stand patience required 
Nice set of gel pens often takes extended time for ink to dry. 
Perfectly good gel pens 
Great pen holder great color variety not that great pens 
The Price is Right. 
Everyday paper 
Nice white and bright 
Works OK in very dark room 
Panasonic Answering Machine will ONLY work with Land Line 
A Sharp(ie) Disappointment 
Dull Colors under room lights 
Not the best for art projects 
Good for black lights not sure about anything else 
Most colors were great - easy to use 
Useful for marking on white backgrounds 
These Are Okay 
neon but not opaque 
Not as bright as I hoped 
Arrived broken 
corners break easily 
Adequate 
For the price it's fine 
Good quality but not perfect 
Quartet Dry Erase Board (23 x 17) 
Good enough for a cheap price 
I've had better 
Good enough 
Adequate small magnetic erasable board 
Love the idea not the reality 
Disappointing but you get what you pay for. 
Nice idea but picture quality isn't great 
I was expecting more 
Left with a case of buyer's remorse 
OK - sharpener. Weak motor good warranty 
Decent unit for the home or small office... 
Great except for one thing 
Good for home use but not for office/school 
speakerphone is horrible 
No problem but its not like having built a better mousetrap. 
Comfy but no anti-slip coating on the bottom makes it slide around on your desk 
Didn't make life easier 
Decent wrist support not good for gaming 
Looks cheap makes a LOT of noise when you slide the mouse 
Wrist support is fine but the scraping noise is annoying! 
Too Slippery For My Tastes 
Some may like it 
Product Didn't Meet Expectations Because My Use Was Not Right 
Good mouse pad. Less good wrist rest. 
It feels wierd 
Works but kind of ugly 
Ok mouse pad 
Good but not great 
Wrist Rocker 
Fellowes wrist rocker 
Not that special... 
Not for all users 
Okay but needs exact table ergonomics to work right. 
A plastic sheet 
A bit of buyer's remorse... 
Mediocre Laser Printer from Canon. 
A useful (but slow) color laser printer - that would make a decent printing scanning and copying tool for small or home offices 
Couldn't get any dry  marker to work legibly on the shiny calendar surface area 
Cheap construction and sub par marker. 
Mid-level quality of construction 
Good Board 
Good Basic Laminator (But You Better Know How To Use It!) 
Okay not great 
Is this worth the price? 
Good tape but nothing special 
Works just fine but not enough to justify the cost 
Easy to work with. 
Strong tape. Overkill for most jobs. 
OK Quality but PRICEY 
Use Sparingly It's Expensive But Good 
Seems good rather expensive 
Good Tape But Expensive 
Yowza that price! 
Pretty generic 
Decent Product ... 
Tape without dispenser 
Disappointing.  I'll stick with the Scotch or Duck.  They are both better values. 
Thicker and stronger but also a bit more expensive than average packing tapes 
Good but not great 
Nice tape but I see no reason for the high price premium. 
Spine quick to insert... but quick to fall out too. 
Spine Is Easy To Put In But Easy To Fall Out Too 
List price is extremely high costs less here 
Good product but a little pricey 
binders 
Fine But Pricey 
Just an ordinary binder 
Ok binders but I did not find the spine much better than any other 
Decent average binders 
Amazon Basics Thermal Laminating Pouches 
Works Good...But Not For Me 
Not very practical 
Practical & Hefty  but a little pricey 
Could be better 
This \lift\ should only be used as a \laptop riser stand\ with an external keyboard - never type with your wrists pivoted upward 
Great Idea Cool Design But Angle is Not Adjustable 
Watch your angle 
Awkward to use for my laptop. 
Didn't work for us at first 
Lift and tilt your laptop PC a simple yet pricey gadget 
Just so so 
It's Okay But Not Really  Helpful for Me. 
Would be perfect if the resting angle was adjustable 
Totally under-whelmed 
just OK 
Good height but flimsy 
useful stand - some limitations 
Somewhat wobbly... 
Ok but not outstanding monitor stand. 
My monitor's base is too wide. 
In many ways ideal for my needs... 
Should be stronger and needs adjustability 
Check the width of your monitor's base first 
so far it is good 
Cheap to buy - expensive to use 
Cheap price small footprint & good prints/scans but no Fax/Ethernet & costly ink makes XP-410 a dubious choice for many users 
There are better Epson options to choose from 
Slick Economic Printer 
Decent printer sucks up the ink 
Minimal but with a small footprint 
Versatile printer with a very good scanner 
Great Printer But So Far That's All It Does 
Nice footprint nice look but loud! 
Workable for home shipping 
Pros and cons 
Okay for light-duty sharpening. 
Makes pencils less dull 
Average Sharpener 
Meh. 
Start sharpening in the morning for an afternoon meeting - Ok it's not that bad 
Novelty Sharpening 
Nice USB feature but spend a bit more on something commercial. 
Works ok for sharpening an already sharpened pencil 
Works fairly well 
Satisfactory 
Cheaply made. Works but required fixing first. 
Sadly not for Prismacolors. Not very green. 
Meh...There Are Better Choices 
Convenient but not much power... not expecting it to last long 
A BIT UNDERPOWERED FOR EFFICIENT USE 
No Batteries Needed 
Pricey compared to more capable laminators 
Meh... 
3.5 stars 
Not All That Useful 
Didn't feel as comfortable using it as had expected 
Helpful pad but lacks some key features 
It's ok 
Could Be a Little Better 
Just ok 
Things To Do is ok 
A handy to-do pad for your desk or counter but not refillable 
Heavy smooth paper in disposable cover 
Nice Pad Could be Better 
It's Okay Large Line Space Large Footprint 
Better notepads available 
Simply OK 
Memo pad; hard cover is not useful on the one I received. Does not support pad up at an angle. 
Just a regular notepad! 
Wish it was smaller and that the stand was sturdier. 
A promising product but it's not quite there yet. 
It's alright for a notepad but there are some flaws 
Nice To-Do List Pad 
\Snap your move\ 
Not all features work consistently. 
Problems Putting it Together But Seemingly Ok Once Assembled 
One door warped; Apparent (slight!) water damage on the top surface. 
Big! 
Huge binder easy access pretty cover somewhat sturdy 
In which I sound like a grouchy old man. 
INSANELY Big!!! 
Design Could Be Improved 
Huge Binder Durability Questionable 
Large ... holds just about anything ... not sure it will last an entire school year 
Kind of flimsy but good size 
Really well designed but not perfect. 
Rugged But Also Bulky and Oddly Laid Out 
Good for an adult but not a child 
Great but needs more compartments. 
Bends easily 
nice storage features too wide 
Little bit too bulky 
decent for price 
a little underwhelmed 
Average binder 
Nice Features but Unattractive Bubbling 
basic sturdy a little pricey 
Not 4 pockets expensive easy to open 
Average binder 
Great For Kids Nice Bold Color Average- Quality... 
Good binder but wow it's expensive!! 
Good Features But Also Disappointing 
easy to open 
Not very heavy duty but rings are very good 
binder 
Nothing wondrous nothing abysmal 
Mine came ripped 
Edges are weak. 
love the pink 
No frills other than the vibrant color 
ok binder stiff rings 
Not really \heavy duty\ but okay 
Adequate 
Expensive for an average binder 
Not sure how Heavy Duty this is. 
ok but pricey 
great color 
Generic Binder Good Hinge 
Basic \no frills\ binder. 
Mediocre Quality 
Nice binder but could be more strong! 
Middle Of The Road 
Read the Fine Print 
Sturdy binder but flaw on sample 
Just Okay 
Ten bucks? It might be worth three. 
Functional binder but not as strong as another similar binder I have 
Decent binder but really nothing stellar - feels cheap and plastic cover already bubbling off cardboard 
These things have been too cheap for years. 
Not Terrible But Not Worth a Premium Price Tag 
It's...a binder 
Okay But Costly and Not as Reinforced as Expected 
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link 
High Cost Low Quality 
Solid Binder 
As good as any store brand binder 
Durable = quality? 
Serviceable but NOT Heavy Duty! 
Okay Binder  for School Children - Not for 'Client Use' 
Okay but looks and feels cheaply made 
edges are more durable 
Overpriced 
It's good but... 
Already Cracked but Holding Up 
Great for kids learning to write but only one piece of lead? 
Mixed Review 
USE ALOT OF PRESSURE WITH NO BREAKAGE!!! 
Nice if you tend to break leads 
good for what they are for 
Nice solid lead but pencil is hard and uncomfortable to hold 
These perform well and look nice... a good alternative to regular pencils 
I wanted to love them but... 
Good nor great machine 
Barebones I think 
Heavy Weight Physically But Light Weight Performer 
Monster size great for lots of office printing 
Falls apart too quickly 
Great for home files not so great for school. 
Nice but a little awkward.... 
BIG! and wide and deep 
nice but too big for school 
Sturdy 
It's huge and has a lot of single stitch spots 
Misses the Mark A Bit For Students 
Good Not Great Boxes 
Pretty good but I prefer Bankers Box brand 
Not high-end but decent 
Sturdy not self sealing includes side legend 
It's a box 
Smaller than the picture shows. $2.60 per box. 
A good size for some items 
Good quality and the biggest box you would probably want. 
Affordable no frills boxes 
Good if you need 20 
Okay I like other styles better. 
Nada the green plastic mount was off putting 
Solid cute trendy... but not worth the price for what you get! 
You can't write on it with artist pens (or pencil for that matter) 
Fun But Sort of Chintzy 
Fun product but pretty pricey 
Nice colors 
Not exactly washi tape 
Scotch Expressions Magic Tape 
Great for paper. 
Creative. 
Expensive colored Scotch tape 
Can't write on it.... 
A crafty twist on Scotch tape 
Great Look but Scratches Easily and Moderately Functional 
Good for books in lockers without crossbars; limited appeal otherwise. 
Good enough for an extra shelf..... 
Functional locker pocket 
pockets are pretty tight 
Major Fail 
a bit tall 
Not as cool as I thought it'd be... 
whole day isn't covered 
Inexpensive. 
Thin Cork Board 
It's just... ok 
Good quality dense cork board for reminders cards and photos for your office; mounting could be improved! 
Thin but sturdy 
Good price... but very cheap cork and poor packaging. 
Pretty much what it looks like.  Not bad for the price. 
Functional But Flimsy 
Pretty Cut & Dry 
With A Few Adjustments This Calendar Would Be Perfect 
Permanent mount smashed corners marker too big 
Comes with magnets but is not magnetic 
Flimsy and hard to erase 
Works ok pen is hard to erase after 2 weeks 
Bare bone but functional 
A large dry-erasable wall calendar that would work fine for both families and small offices 
Average Product 
it's OK... 
looks nice feels very flimsy 
Cute but mine fell down and busted after a few days 
Decent enough little board. 
Sort of flimsy but adequate when placed on a level surface. 
hangs with adhesive pads only 
Light weight item 
Large 
No chalk... 
Good looking but not heavy enough 
It's ok for the price 
A little disappointed. 
Inexpensive chalkboard but low quality 
Consider the actual writing surface size. 
Sturdy but very small writing surface 
Smaller than you think 
Small but still functional. 
Looks nice less filling 
Headaches on setup but the nice prints are worth the effort. 
A Tale of Two Printers 
Not heavy duty 
This Binder is great for occasional use did not find it to be heavy duty 3 ring binder. 
For a binder it's a darn fine product. 
These binders are fine but I certainly would not call them \heavy duty\. 
Not what I would call Heavy Duty 
Wilson Jones 363 Heavy Duty Round Ring View Binder 
Only for light or occasional use 
meh 
Wireless Issues 
Connected easily mediocre print quality 
Solid Nice Looking Small 
Small and thin but good for tight places. 
Great Concept poor execution 
Quality Product but Odd Value 
Not sure on home use of this 
Probably better for office use than home use 
Works for me 
OK for occasional use clean it constantly 
A heavy duty laminator that gives me pause 
Solid but cheap coloring. Corner punch/cutting doesn't work. 
Some parts great some parts not 
Teensy Items 
Low on Variety High on Distraction 
High Price for Convenience 
Buy it for reduced resistance when mousing 
Good for light duty work 
Decent value for the money 
Entry Level 
Lots of features but will it last? 
Works but only average print quality at best; an ok budget printer and scanner 
Small printer than print scan copy and fax BUT not the best quality print. 
Decent all around printer but for just a little more you can get the excellent Brother MFC-J870DW 
Mine's going back! 
Fine Pen and Stylus 
Presto Chango 
It's OK ... 
Good pen soft stylus tip 
Less clutter next to my chair 
Better pen than stylus 
As a stylus it's great but as a pen the ink flow is variable 
I'm going to stick with this prehensile thumb deal... 
Works as advertised 
Writes well but not comfortable to write with for any length of time.  Good for the stylus 
Decent combination item but a little high-priced 
Ball point with \squishy\ stylus 
Zebra shoots and sorta scores 
Not for Me But Maybe for You 
Sleek but a hassle to set up 
Not perfect but easy to use and sleek. EATS ink. 
PHOTOS are a Pain 
Light Duty Only 
Scans fast and wirelessly but unnecessarily complicated software installation and substandard TWAIN driver 
Easy Portability; Adequate Scans 
SO FAR CANT GET IT SET UP 
Oh Brother... 
\Laughter and tears... 
Not the scanner of choice (yet) due to urgent software matter 
Probably 4 Stars For PC 
Needs help 
A cheaper (but slower) alternative to the ScanSnap 
not as good as a Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500 for a Mac user 
Nice portable document scanner 
Not for me! 
Get's the job done. 
Good for on-the-go scanners but not for big jobs 
Software could be better 
It works it's handy 
If price is your primary concern then this scanner may be for you. 
If clouds had scanners... 
Too Big 
Easy setup as a network printer but slow and expensive for a multi-function printer. OK for photo printing. 
Epson XP-950 vs Canon Pixma Pro-100 vs Canon iP4000 
Great for photos but not quite as a day to day printer 
sleek printer but not good at printing blacks 
Larger footprint but prints 11x17 
Limited amount of reasons to buy this printer 
frustratingly beautiful 
OK photo printer but I think it is not the leader of the pack 
Fair Printer 
Good Student/Casual User Printer 
Great little inexpensive printer with quality results 
Compact Unit Slightly More Limited Features 
Good Printer for Occasional Use 
Okay but not worth the hefty pricetag 
Excellent Ink 
Very decent but the XP-850 is better 
Good for a home office with great features for Mac users. 
Very good but some issues 
Disappointed 
A vast improvement 
mixed bag 
Pilot mr animal pen 
awkward design for what could have been a good pen 
Writes great but has other issues 
Affordable Bauble I Mean Pen 
Heavy thick pen nice ink 
Hefty feel hefty tag 
Adequate but not special. 
Why the animals? 
Not as smooth as the Pilot Axiom Ballpoint 
Ricoh Multifunction Laser Printer 
No WI-FI but good color scanner good printing. 
Good printer 
Decent board dried out pen highish price for quality 
Pretty good deal at this price..... 
pen is very poor board is fine 
Notes to Self 
The best thing about this whiteboard is that is is narrow and will fit in smaller spots. 
Just O.K. 
Not a bad printer but not a good choice 
Works but has jamming issues and expensive toner 
Heavy somewhat confusing set up No Mac drivers 
broken? 
Value-priced ergonomic chair. 
For big people no lumbar adjustment 
Solid chair with a few drawbacks 
Could use stronger lower back support. 
Cute bit of bling but how long will it last? 
Not Exactly What I Thought 
Cute and will keep the guys from borrowing my stapler 
It's just ok 
bling stapler 
Nice Swingline Stapler But I Don't Know About The Bling 
Good 
Bling out the stapler 
A fine inexpensive stapler. The bling feature is silly. 
okay stapler with bling 
cute 
Decent enough 
Good basic stapler with customization! 
Swingline Bling Fashion Stapler 
Cheap light stapler no staples 
Not for the artistically challenged 
There are other options to consider before you buy 
A middle of the road shredder 
Confusing - manual says not to shred more than 10 sheets of paper in one pass and to remove staples/paperclips etc 
This is a good shredder for minimal shredding functions 
Less speed more grunt. 
Good for what it is intended for but don't take the 12 page rating too seriously 
Glides Easily But Not Good for Arthritic Hands 
OK I like it 
Good Board Bad Marker 
Usable but nothing special 
Would be better if a wall hook were included as a hanging option. 
Cheap and basic for a kid 
Functional Dry-Erase Board 
Inexpensive marker board good for small spaces 
Very cheap dry-erase board 
Nothing of note in any regard 
Just okay... 
Perfect Size For The Refrigerator 
Convenient but not quite out of the pack 
Good but not great 
Arrived Bent 
Cheap cheap materials and not the best choice out there... but it gets the job done. 
Duo Action: A Quartet Magnetic Combination Cork And Dry-Erase Board Review 
Works but I would not want to 'permanently' hang this on a wall! 
Handy to have ... 
Nice Magnetic List Maker 
Basic with not enough room for writing... 
Over priced for what it is. 
Works better than the Real Estate Freebies 
Handy. 
A Little Expensive Serves its Purpose ... 
Stays in Place! 
It's ok 
Very small sections to write in. 
Three Perforated Writing Blocks Per Page 
It's OK... 
Cute but not as functional as it could be. 
Good Idea But Needs Improvements 
Just ok 
Don't like it 
Well thought out design but could be better 
When you need one you need one 
Could use a stronger magnet 
Stronger magnets & fewer labels would be nice 
Decent For Small Lists Poor Design Not as Pictured... 
I don't like the perforations.  Magnets could be a little stronger. 
Not as tall as it appears... 
Held all I could put into it but easy to dislodge (magnet could be stronger) 
It's okay 
I know office products are pricey but...... 
Like it 
Very sizeable - unfortunately the magnet isn't very strong 
Quartet Magnetic Combination Board 11x14 
A Decent Board 
Its cute and functional but the magnets are really weak. 
Decent whiteboard but better are available 
OK for seven bucks 
Cheaply made but does the job 
Acceptable combination board 
Simply Okay 
The board itself isn't bad but buy some different pens. 
Meh. 
Average Quality 
Weak magnets again 
Good idea not sure how well executed 
Not overly impressed. 
I Can't Recommend Using the Magnet Strips for Hanging It 
Quartet Magnetic Mail Organizer Storage Pouch Review 
Good magnet 
Just OK... 
It works but not too impressed 
open at the sides 
It Works 
Works but magnet requires a large surface area 
Works well but dull 
This Would Be Best for a Locker 
Okay. 
ink powders off these quickly 
Not horrible probably best suited for a tween/teen. 
Arrived mangled 
When Magnetic doesn't mean Magnetic 
Sharper looking than an ordinary white board but arrived with dents and a scratch 
Looks like stainless 
Its OKAAAY 
Requires a little more effort 
A flimsy but functional cork board 
Well yeah...it gets the job done and no more.... 
pretty flimsy product 
No wall hooks just tape - Hope you like it exactly where you put it. 
Flimsy Average Corkboard 
Mostly functional very unimpressive 
Functional but may not last the long run 
It's Okay 
Not bad 
\Not flashy...\ is right.  Just a sub to mediocre cork board 
Nice little bulletin board but self-stick hangers are PERMANENT! 
Basic thin plastic cork board. 
Works 
Just okay. Nothing fancy nothing horrible. 
Fine 
\Cheap\ yet Functional. BASIC. BASIC. BASIC. 
Good idea...But... 
You get what's advertised but it's a bit useless. 
Week starts with Monday 
A little small for a busy work schedule / office 
Great price not so great quality 
Letter-sized memo board 
Quartet Magnetic Dry-Erase Board 
Ok but not the best 
Weak Magnets 
Inexpensive and made that way 
What is there to say? 
You Get What You Pay For 
It is adequate 
Pretty cheap but usefeul 
Protrudes magnets too weak to stick to fridge. 
Easy Open Binders 
It's a binder 
Probably not worth any extra money just to open easily. 
Bound 
Good Design But Cheap Materials Make This Undesirable 
Nondescript Binder 
Not My Favorite View-Binder 
Average quality binder at a higher cost.... 
Good enough 
Nothing super special 
For an \ultra duty\ binder this is looking mighty average 
Standard Binder 
Adequate 1\ binder no more no less. 
Problems with the quality of workmanship; but materials are good 
Considering the price and the puffery I expected better. 
Just an ordinary binder 
Great file for professionals or students alike 
It is a good binder. 
Could be better: feels weak when full 
Nice Binder - Prefer The D Ring Model 
Arrived with bubbles under the cover and several dents almost rips on the back cover. 
I like this size binder for use in storing my Family Heritage Reserach. 
What&#8217;s now &#8220;ultra&#8221; used to be industry standard. 
Nice enough a binder 
It has wrinkles! 
OK Binder- needs some better features 
Design Good But Quality Lacking 
It works but it's not heavy duty and feels like it should cost about two bucks. 
It's a binder made of polypropylene and it holds papers 
Basic notebooks for manuals and reference materials 
Basic binder - good for storing documents 
Just OK. 
Slightly Nicer Than The \Basic\ Line But You Can Still Do Better 
Useful to file documents 
Plastic 
Overpriced but well made 
Overpriced 
Not worth double what I pay for other binders 
Acceptable 
It looks like it was left out in the rain 
The Binder will do the job as it is strong! 
Would have been a good binder but covered in bubbles on the front and back. 
It's a mixed bag 
Hinge was singed 
Not the best binder I've used but also not the worst 
Several minor flaws throughout make this a bad choice for students 
Wrinkled bubbly cover but nice strong hinge 
Not as \heavy duty\ as expected 
Waiting to see.... 
2.5 Stars For An Otherwise Praiseworthy Product. 
Unnecessarily Complicated 
Just Post-It Notes with Advertising for the Evernote App 
Smooth Finish 
Decent laminating pouches - nothing special 
Wrinkles a little too easily 
Thin but good 
Middle of the pack pouches 
Good quality laminating pouches though not the best value if you shop around 
Excellent Pouches For Preserving Sensitive Documents Great For The Classroom... 
They'll Do 
Works great if you have the laminator tool. 
I don't have a laminater. 
decent pouches not the best value but not bad 
Average-ish? 
OK for lightweight storage; a bit pricey; some issues with assembly and a solution 
Good for my purpose 
light duty storage boxes not cheap 
Heavy quality but disaasembles easily. 
A little too big 
Like This Larger Size.  Very Handy! 
Looks Nice and is Fairly functional 
High quality but the spaces aren't very useful 
A Somewhat Perplexing Device ... 
101 Uses for That Little Slot on Your Organizer... Okay 5. 
Why not make the memo holder fit regular post it pads? 
It's pretty 
OK but not THAT impressive 
Better Than Wooden 
Clunky 
Disappointed 
Spaces are too small 
nice boxes and lines... 
OK Magnetic Notepad 
A thin sheet of paper with magnets glued to the back... 
Wish it was a little bigger 
Tear each sheet in two 
So it's a to-do list 
Love MEAD but... 
Nice Idea But Not Much Space To Write 
It's okay 
Nice idea with average implementation. 
Great Product Idea Not So Great Execution 
Neat Liitle Book - No way to \Organize\ 
stylistic yet one wonders for what use this is really intended. Smaller than imagined yet ample space for countless accounts. 
Not what I expected 
Nothing unusual 
No Real Reason To Purchase 
Good idea -- but needs a little tweaking 
GOOD BUT COULD BE BETTER 
Helpful idea hampered by small font and light print. 
Cute but not really necessary -- a plain piece of paper works just as well 
If you live in a world of FIVE DAYS a week! 
Mead Organizher Reminder Center 
Classy look awkward usage. 
Memo Board 
Helpful! 
There are SEVEN days in a week 
Disappointing 
Keeps you organized though not fashion-friendly 
Really good concept; not as great execution. 
6x10 is really small when split in two halves 
Excellent Solution but.... 
Mead Organizher Write 'N Wipe Weekly Undated Dry-Erase Calendar 
Weekly Organizer 
Not a bad idea but not very useful 
Nice idea but it's a bit too small to be practical 
Magnetic 
No storage for included marker 
Not easy to clean 
Prone to sabotage 
Monthly Dry Erase Board 
Grear for short notes; too small for much organization 
Just Ok 
good and bad 
Flawed 
A Dry Erase Calendar 
Family calendar 
Not what I'm looking for 
What's the point? 
Great Hanging Organizer Calendar 
Okay... not the best solution though 
Still On the Fence 
Not exactly what I'd hoped 
A little too large 
Best Part is that it's Purple.... 
Either you need it or you don't 
Easy way to keep track of spending 
Too cheap. 
Probably fine if you start when your child enters preschool but \compartments\ are small 
Nice But Could Be Much Better 
Only for the most severe cases of scrapbook-a-phobia 
First-rate Lamp: But is it Worth the Cost? 
Tightly Wrapped Will Pack a Punch but Has a Short Range 
Barely OK but it does fit the Mini pretty well. 
Nice idea if you have a small apartment or just getting your move started 
Neat idea poor quality boxes 
Okay for a VERY Small Move 
Bankers Box SmoothMove Moving Kit 8 Small Boxes 6 Medium Boxes 4 Rolls Bubble Wrap 1 Roll Packing Tape and 1 Marker (7716301 
Buy it for the medium duty boxes not the extras 
Nice Boxes Not Enough Bubble Wrap. 
Mediocre performance 
Expensive decent quailty 
Perfect size for moving... but 200% more expensive for the *exact* same box at Lowes or Home Depot! 
A large box with medium strength cardboard 
OK No More 
Get The Medium Boxes Similar Size But Better Built 
The website you have to go to order skins is very slow 
Cute Concept Otherwise Nothing Special 
Unique but not reliable 
Not the fun I expected 
Pretty stapler but it only includes a single skin and is mostly made of plastic. Is not a full sized stapler. 
Basic Stapler Not Heavy Duty 
Does not staple 20 sheets custom skin gimmick is... gimmicky. 
A substandard stapler with a gimmick and a inflated price. 
Kinda cool but unnecessary 
Swingline Stapler With An Optional \Skin\ 
Good fashion stapler 
Decent light-duty stapler 
Less useful than I thought although may be just right for some 
Okay for the Price 
Pockets are great - other features are iffy 
Good idea but too flimsy to be all that useful and what's with the single-position tabs 
Loved the trio of inside pockets but two important features are lacking whether used at home or on the fly. 
I like the extra inside pockets 
Functional and sturdy but does not inspire confidence. 
It works but doesn't seem sturdy 
Works for Me 
Moshi Stanza Duo Stylus Pen 
A Little Pricey for What It Is 
Not bad - Wish it had a slightly slimmer barrel 
Useful and pretty 
Handy But Not Phenomenal 
Marker Caddy 
A little bigger than it appears 
Over Priced 
Kind of cheap. 
Nice to have but not necessarily most convenient 
Quartet Prestige 2 Marker Caddy 
Markers are great the rest... not so much 
Idea is better than execution 
Good markers decent eraser 
Good dry-erase markets bad eraser cheap holder 
Limitless Comfort &#8211; Ergonomic Laptop Desk 
Prints beautifully and I found it quite difficult to set up wirelessly. 
Mostly Good 
Could use a large price reduction 
Good printer for kids college students and back up 
Deal Killers: (1) MANUAL Duplex Scanning and (2) Paper Jams 
No Color Screen 
Wireless Setup Doesn't Work/Wired Works OK 
Excellent Photos: Difficult Setup & Multiple Features Make it Very Complex to Use 
Big Bulky and not a fan 
Not bad for the price 
Ok but there are better Canon Printers out there! 
Big and Bold but not Smart 
Difficult to set up 
Decent printer but you can do better 
Really ultra-fine points on these. 
Very specific usage - for very small writing 
Good but not great 
It may be tough and durable but I had a few issues with it 
Decent Binder; Nothing Extraordinary 
More suited for gentle use and archiving 
Only Time Will Tell 
Great quality and paper handling. Setup is a nightmare 
Will burn through a pile of docs but complicated to set up and use 
There were a lot of little strips to remove from the scanner that are applied so it can be shipped easily. You're instructed to 
Wired good. Wireless fail. 
Get the Fujitsu iX500 instead 
Fast 2-sided scans but super awkward setup 
It will do the job but \WorkForce\ = \Forces you to work\ 
Ok doesn't compare to a Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500 
Complicated Setup Scanning OK 
OK but with some concerns 
Wonderful Hardware Software issues. 
Very easy to assemble but for me at least it isn't comfortable 
Comfortable but best for a somewhat wider and lighter body overall 
Good chair meh on the price. 
Nice Easy-to-Assemble Chair 
Works well once it is set up 
Excellent networking/connectivity otherwise not that impressive at the price 
Wireless printer that works but at a cost. I prefer Epson WorkForce 630. 
Maybe Not  . . . . 
Not intuitive to set up 
Not quite the pen for me 
Pen and Pencil 
I am a pen snob. This passes... almost. 
Good idea but it's got some flaws... 
Nice product BUT.... 
Template issues 
I'd like these much better if I could download a template. 
Not as easy as you might think. 
3.5 stars - great labels less-than-perfect software. 
Love the look and functionality but not the limited features. 
Prints from anywhere!  Otherwise meh. 
Adequate 
Not as Good as HP Usually Is 
No template in MSWord or Wordperfect 
Fine for teens and adults 
Red is Dull Color 
Clear customizable cover????  Where? 
So-so Binder 
Not so durable. 
It's a binder 
Mead Binder 
WiFi and NFC wireless printing 
A rock solid label maker weakened by stupid design flaws 
Good label makeras label makers go 
Interesting design but I don't care for the rings inside 
Ninder Better Notebook Than Binder 
Is It A Notebook? Is It A Binder? Identity Crises. 
Five Star Flex Hybrid 1-inch NoteBinder 
flexible light but rings are a pain to open and close 
Arg! Same item as item #72186. Darn. It's just okay then. 
Probably won't last 
Too bulky for the smaller arms of school kids and not enough electronic compartments for older kids 
For A Low-Tech Reality 
shape is a bit odd as it could fit a ... 
Okay light one really poor functional flaw. 
Okay but I don't except it to have a long shelf \life\ 
Great for lockers not for other uses. 
Took me a long time to figure out where batteries went and hard to open. 
Adequate light if you can install the batteries 
Serves its purpose BUT . 
Serves Its Purpose 
Just OK 
Where Do The Batteries Go? 
Small: strictly for note taking 
Smaller than I thought 
Perfectly Normal Notebook 
I'm not sure what niche this fills 
A bit expensive in my opinion 
good quality but poor value 
Not quite a five-star value 
Average 
A giant high-quality all-in-one office printer ... with a few bugs. 
Problems at initial setup took a star away from an otherwise nice printer 
Grabs chunks of paper ... repeatedly 
Like other Workforce Printers: Suitable for small home office/ home school use but can become expensive 
With reservations 
Horrible Wi-Fi/Connectivity. 
Excellent Features Are Overcome by Glitchy Software Ghostly Printing 
Defective upon arrival -- waiting for replacement 
Suitable for small home office/ home school use but can become expensive in very heavy use 
Seemingly decent product but poor Amazon/Sentry Description & Documentation!
