It isn't extra conditioning 
Hmmm no.. 
Didn't like the smell 
?? Not sure about this stuff yet 
Great scent but not a strong hold 
don't last for weeks 
Stayed on overnight but... 
OK since it doesn't sting but the bond doesn't last long

Not the best for naturally very curly hair types 
Stopped working after only a couple of uses. 
Awkward and  Heavy  to Handle 
I could not get it to work like the infomercials.

Moisturizing/Hydrating Overnight Mask but NOT For Sensitive Skin 
This is not as bright 
A little dull a little small a little less than expected 
Honestly 
Absolutely NOT for people of color :( 
Exact copy of cheaper cody sand and sable

A bit flowery at first doesn't last.

Really Wanted to Like This 
I prefer tinted moisturizer and separate sunscreen 
Not for me 
Don't think I'm going to use this. 
It did not work for my wife - Heavy waxy drying cream 
Ow. Irritated my eyes. 
Sensitive Eyes Be Careful 
I don't like it 
Very little results burning sensation when applied 
Doesn't absorb 
A lovely moisturizer but that's about it 
Too drying for my skin type

Watch Out!!!!

Difficult to use 
Not my favorite 
rather unpleasant smell 
Nah 
One size does not fit all 
Did not recieve correct item.

Very bright and blotchy. 
Good color hard to apply 
Oily 
I don't get it...? 
Blonde shade too light for medium to dark blonde hair 
Works Just OK if You Stay Completely Dry 
I thought it looked great but.... 
Not for me 
Smells great but doesn't work great 
Too perfumey I'd rather smell nutty argan oil 
Left my hair limp and frizzy 
disappointed 
Left hair dry and limp 
disappointed 
Not a fan 
Yummy Smell but... 
Not a fan 
messy and smelly 
Itchy! 
Good product but misleading name 
Not really for me 
Doesn't Do Anything 
'Morroccan Oil' Knockoff FAIL 
My hair looks no where near as model 
Left my hair with a residue but not softness 
very thin conditioner 
Better for Short Unprocessed Hair... like that of children 
Did not condition well 
Works for a Short Time 
Didn't do much 
Last Suave I'm trying 
very scented a bit drying on my hair. 
Didn't like! 
Weak hold but a nice smell and alcohol-free formula 
Not for my son's hair 
Dislike the smell 
Does not spike or hold well 
It doesn't control a whole lot... 
Fail! Not a pleasurable sensation 
Just not worth it 
Not smooth and stings eyes 
It Left Me \Chilly\ 
Not pleasurable at all; Like Bengay On Your Face 
It Dehydrated and Burned My Sensitive Skin! 
Leaves skin a bit tacky. 
cheap! 
Skip these or regret it later. 
Everything is pretty but only the buffers work - the files are junk 
You get what you pay for 
boo 
Hmmm 
To Thinnnnn!! 
These are cute but you get what you paid for ... 
looks so different 
just so so 
Very very hard to get the stars glitter etc on. 
I don't really like it. 
Not a fan of this polish 
wasnt my favorite 
Chalk from the art store is better. 
loved the idea - not the product 
Ehh 
cute but useless :( 
Try something else 
Not a winner 
Clever idea but not user-friendly 
Love it...if only it stayed up 
Way Too Expensive 
A few problems... 
Sort of a disappointment 
Fog free but at what price? 
Shockingly poor quality for the price. 
Overpriced and Overmatched 
Looks like something you might find in a prison cell 
Not really a \mirror\ but more of a plasticy foil. 
Definitely read reviews before purchase 
Not practical 
Zadro Z'Fogless LED Light Water Mirror 
Not the best 
Over-Engineered and Not Durable 
Faulty overpriced 
fogless but not necessarily a mirror 
Not great 
Save yourself some money find a different UV Lamp!!! 
Sticky Not Long-Lasting 
Sticky 
Sticky feel 
Not a good lip gloss 
more like lip paint 
Not My Favorite 
sticky pale 
Incredibly Over-Priced Hardly Any Color... 
Sticky barely any color. Way way overpriced. 
Didn't resolve my chapped or dry lips! 
Looks good but I dislike the texture and taste 
Just not a fan 
Very runny thin coverage 
Perhaps a sponge to clean up with but not a sponge for the face. 
Save Your Money!! 
not good for make-up application much too absorbent 
Not worth the 2 month wait
