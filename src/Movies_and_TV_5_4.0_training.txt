Shiny Christmas Memory! 
UnderDog succeeds 
Basics still good 
Good Basic Cookery 
I don't know what to say about this movie 
Powerful. 
A MOVIE THAT'LL GIVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME 
Jesus still evokes controversy after 2 millenia! 
Deeply moving cinema with epic feel 
Good but too much blood. 
Truth or Dare! 
The film about Jesus by which all others will compare... 
Passion of Christ 
Trying to Look at the Passion Dispassionately 
Necessarily brutal. 
A powerful revelation 
Not for the faint of heart! 
A film we should all see 
A True Icon 
A lot of apologies seem due to Mel Gibson 
Video 
why 
Painful Violent Heart wrenching but with a Purpose... 
Powerful & Thought-Provoking 
Interesting portrayal 
no special features 
Cinematic. Powerful. Flawed. 
Our Passion 
A gripping emotional film 
The Passion of the Christ- Painful and Intense 
The Passion: An Intense Depiction Unlike Any Other 
the passion and ressurection 
A worthwhile watch..... 
Almost a masterpiece( to me personally) 
The Most Powerful Film of 2004 
\...Passion...\ meets Controversy 
A graphic and respectful depiction of Christ's suffering 
Passion = Suffering? 
nice 
Preaching to the converted 
Held of on buying this and this is why... 
Amazing Film and Transfer 
The Greatest Movie of Christ Ever Made! Now Even Better In Blu-Ray! 
OK I'll admit... I liked it but it's not as violent as Straw Dogs 
The Beating of the Christ 
I bought it but never ever watched it. 
A Religious Pageant without the Good Friday Spell 
Facts of History 
A Great Movie But Does It Go Too Far? 
....why lie? i saw it for the violence - and the languages 
Like/Dislike this film for what it is - a hollywood film 
very uneasy 
Not for the faint of heart or stomach 
It is viloent 
Mel may have his issues but this movie is good! 
Very good dramatization 
Worth Renting would you watch it more than once? 
In defense of Mel Gibson 
It Is What It Is: The Blatant In-Your-Face Story Of Jesus' Crucifixion 
watched this artistic rendering 
Brutal and very violent 
High quality Blu-ray. High production values. Difficult to watch. 
A little too religious perhaps? 
A tough film to view objectively. Maybe that's okay. 
Well worth watching 
The Ultimate Torturing of Jesus Christ 
well done and well intentioned 
It will stick in your head. 
riveting cinematography 
Made Me Think- 
Powerful & Compelling Film but Climax Lacking 
Historically accurate but so what? 
Absolutely Stunning. A beautiful gut-wrenching epic. 
Artistically Brilliant though Not Always Accurate 
eye opening and inspiring 
PRETTY GOOD! 
Gibson's film is not perfect but it's a powerful rendering of the story nonetheless... 
Will be long remembered as the actual truth not just a film 
It's like being caught between two places... 
Impassioned 
Glad I saw it won't be buying it. 
Good Biblical Movie Reflecting the Life of Jesus Christ 
Mel Gibson's passion 
VIOLENT MOVIE  MAKES ITS  POINT THAT MURDERER GOES FREE CHRISTED IS CRUSIFIED 
It's one of the most intense movies i've ever seen. 
Mel's \Passion\ 
Great movie but will make you feel physically sick 
Forgive Us 
A &quot;Passion&quot; full of pain and power 
The Moose Hole - Gibson Shows His 'Passion' 
very powerful film 
The ultimate religious persecution now on celluloid. 
At Times \Passion\ate 
passion of the christ 
A Very Very Contraversial Religous Film Indeed! 
Easy to be a hater but... 
Amazing suffering for your salvation! 
unnecessary gore 
A passion for violence that's almost too intense 
Sunday school snuff film. 
Well polished 
Ultimately you have to make up your own mind... 
A reality check for complacent Christians. 
A Very Good Upgrade for your DVD edition 
The Last Hours Of The Masheeakh 
Powerful Cinema But . . . 
Cathartic and Moving 
Breathtaking 
HAPPY EASTER!!! 
Not as Good as the Hype 
The Passion for A.D. 2004 
DVD Details (since Amazon doesn't bother) 
Very well done. 
Mel's Passion but not exactly biblically correct. 
A graphic portrayal of Christ's last few hours on earth. 
Not simply a bloodfest 
Deeply moving and filled with emotion 
Brilliant film but brutality went a little too far. 
Very Good Jesus Movie 
the scourging alone would have killed him 
Sobering yet also disturbing 
Good God Y'all 
Never seen anything like it. 
Mel Gibson Delivers...... 
It's A Movie 
A most excellent historical depiction! 
Almost a Truly Great Film 
Watch this BEFORE you show the kids. 
Less a movie than moving vignettes of the Sorrowful Mysteries and Stations of the Cross 
Perhaps the Years Most Controversial Film 
Powerful moving depiction of Jesus' final hours 
both the negative and positive reviewers have valid points 
One of the best movies on the life of Christ 
One of the stronger films of the year. 
The Passion of The Christ 
The Passion of Mel Gibson 
Will Give You Pause To Think About The Reality Of The Crucifixion 
... come to know and respect as one of the great minds of our time 
Pretty accurate portrayal 
Gifted Hands 
Gifted Hands 
good for pelvic floor issues.

Disney for Adults

great 
Only Really Enjoyable if You Aren't a Heinlein Fanboy 
StarShip Troopers- The Cliff Note edtion 
Unsubtle? Au contraire: too subtle for its own good 
Another dollop of Verhoeven weirdness

Don't take too seriously.  Standard-setting effects. 
Underrated Science Fiction Classic 
Convincing yet disappointing adaptation to Heinleins novel. 
If you own a Sony BluRay Player Please Read- 
Starship Troopers 
DIDN'T EXPECT THIS FILM WOULD BECOME ICONIC

Film School in a Box form someone who created his own School

3.5 stars out of 4 
An Important Film From John Singleton 
Boys N The Hood - Excellent 
Sure It's a Great Movie but... 
Sad depiction of reality 
An excellent interpretation of a classic novel 
A good film but not as faithful as it pretends to be 
A Well-Done Period Picture. 
Unappreciated Classic! 
A SWEEPING EPIC 
A worth-while version 
Love it but Deniro? Good God man... get a clue. 
ILHM Reviews: Frankenstein 
Very Intense! Well done Mr. Branagh! 
Actually 4 and a 1/2 
The first movie treatment that's actually close to the book 
Not exactly like the book but still commendable. 
Frankenstein... 
Film Does Novel Justice 
The Art House Version Of Frankenstein 
Haunting Tale 
A classic 
The BEST Frankenstein ever made.... 
Monster Mash 
Realistic interpretation 
The definitive version of the book so far; recommended. 
Not an authentic adaptation of the book but still fun. 
The closest yet 
Frankenstein 
It is a tale that is still poignant to this day. 
OK 'almost' Mary Shelly's Frankenstein 
Stands high above the rest...but not totally perfect 
The powerful story told again 
Fantastic Interpretation 
A stylish horror movie 
Good adaptation 
Best Scene: 
Pretty Good Adaptation 
Outstanding interpretation 
You Can Find Romance With The Most Unlikeliest Person

Very Good Indeed 
Better than what we usually get 
A nice relaxed romantic-comedy-drama 
Natural 
Complement for a movie library 
The dog deserved an OSCAR too ! 
Great Show 
Steve Martin gives a shameful comedic performance 
Mamet's Best 
Good Steve Martin Role as consummate con man. Super Surprises 
The Spanish Prisoner 
A very different (and welcome) kind of suspense flick 
Very Enjoyable Mamet for The Whole Family! 
\Beware of all enterprises which require new clothes.\ 
A low-keyed spoof of the genre 
For those who like clever mind games. 
Like a Chippendale chair; more great Mamet craftsmanship 
Homage to Hitchcock 
Directing falls short 
The Spanish Prisoner Review 
Interesting. 
Great but one big goof 
A twisty thriller Mamet-style 
Wonderful plot-twisting film! 
Good movie 
The plot dragged me in 
Ingeniously plotted thriller which moves at breakneck speed. 
It's Mamet?  It's Hitchcock?  Stop -- You're both right. 
How can opinions vary so much? 
Starts off slow... 
Mamet's best study of con games 
OFFBEAT AND CAPTIVATING BUT SOME LOGIC MAY HAVE HELPED 
Mind-boggling plot!  Very good movie! 
Outstanding 
Nice although it tends to drag 
Romantics always wake up in the end. 
The sensuality of photography.... 
The fixation of memory and the essence of people 
3 stars for Minnie Driver; an extra star for Jonathan Rhys Meyers (who improves every film in which he appears)! 
Beautiful...some wonderful performances. Worth seeing! 
Get it for Meyers 
The Governess 
Better the second time around... a family in need of Freud 
Beautifully shot the story of a pre-Victorian feminist 
Minnie Driver provides a captivating and erotic performance 
LAVISH CINEMATOGRAPHY...INTRIGUING PERIOD DRAMA... 
Intriguing period piece 
Hal Hartley's Universe 
Weird but in a good way 
Pseudo/quasi/wanna-be...

As good today as when it was first released. 
\Great Carpenter Sci-Fi Film!\
