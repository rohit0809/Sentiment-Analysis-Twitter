Can't install 
unable to click on links! ! 
Works. 
App is ok 
OK.  Biggest need right now? Ability to create folders...like 'saved mail'. 
it still syncs even with it off 
decent but not great 
takes up more internal memory the more you use it  ... 
no manual download problem 
Nice client but missing some features 
Works 
Good but needs a decent help page 
Decent which is disappointing 
obviously based off k9 
Its a little buggy.

Fun application 
Ok if you NEED one.

no good on coby products: ( 
I love catalogues 
More season catalogs 
Almost all right 
Useful not stupendous 
Not for me 
good way to find products 
get more streamline catalogs 
This is an App &amp; a Widget Poorly Designed 
Good concept but needs work 
widget
