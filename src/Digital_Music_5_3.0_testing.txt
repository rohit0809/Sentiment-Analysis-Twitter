Styles P- Gangster & A Gentleman 
I Would've given it a 3.5 but I can't 
I'm a little disappointed 
This CD could be so much better 
Gangster &amp; A Gentleman 
An adequate if not essential release

Formative full on blast 
Just passable debut album from The Used 
Box full of sharp objects? More like a box full of MTV kids

Pretty Good 
Too preachy even for fans 
Call Me Insane but I Expected More. 
Maybe i'm missing something... 
Come on. 
it's ok 
Decent heavy-metal influenced rock album that could've been great - \Blackest Eyes\ is a CLASSIC! Not for everyone - 3.5 stars 
Too straight and narrow to often convey the full emotional extent

good pop cd 
Maybe It Seemed Better On Paper... 
What Happened? 
A Sleepy Albumyet Rock oriented 
Good but doesn't do much for me... 
Good pop-rock sound but married to uneven songwriting. 
Some steps forward but still way too glossy 
Slowly succumbing to the curse of formula

Should Be Better Than This 
Beautiful At Times Powerful But Most of the Time Just Slow and Average 
A missed opportunity 
We've been waiting 6 years for this?

A letdown from one of my favorite bands

|3.5| It's solid but can't touch Morning View. 
Good but...  (3 STARS) 
Just not my favorite side of Incubus 
2.5 stars a mediocre effort from a great band 
Not a weak album but leaves alot to be desired... 
Not bad but definitely nothing great.

Disappointing but good 
OLDER Version 2.0 
Another solid effort from Michael 
George returns.... but  is it worth it? 
GEORGE MICHAELS PATIENCE IS HIT AND MISS. 
Patience 
OK but not stunning 
Patience Pays Off-Somewhat (Nearly 3 Stars) 
An ordinary release from a media icon 
actually 3-1/2 stars........ 
Lacking in excitement 
I can only review one half of this album 
Mose Allison meets Mo Tucker 
Great lyricist! 
Very strange music by a musician with a crazy imagination. 
Get away get here 
Most of the time... good clean fun 
Nice idea; hard to listen to all the way through though

Makes a much better case for the band than the 1st album 
Are we listening to the same album? 
A Tolerance for Noise 
Good but not great 
Could be better

Great collection annoying editing... 
Pretty Good&kinda Overrated 
Not as legendary as I'd hoped 
Living Legends 
its ok i guess 
No 
I like it but a bit too much Bad Boy  influence 
One to buy until the next Fiona Apple CD 
Good Start 
Intelligent music vapid lyrics 
not his best but an ok addition to the collection 
Proof That Tisto Is Better At Mixing 
Great idea on paper but sadly misses on execution. 3+

The Cure \The Cure\ 
Mediocre effort 
Not great not awful just average 
A solid rocking release from &quot;The Cure&quot;. 
Average eclectic mix of Cure styles 
Good Songs...BAD Production 
The original pop act is back...but could've been stronger 
Another decent but not spectacular record by the Cure. 
it's okay 
Music as medication 
Tired and uninspired 
Musically fresh lyrically and vocally familiar 
Why do I keep buying this g-unit garbage. 
I didn't get quite enough 
Good enough 
Definitely not as good as Young Buck's or 50 Cent's album but it's decent - 3.5 stars

3 1/2 stars 
Crunchy. 
Bonafide Hit...

A Solid Addition to G-Unit 
Only If You Are a Steve Earle Fan 
Haphazard 
The First Steve Earle Album I have Doubts About 
Political Rants Obscure Some Excellent Songs and Great Music 
\What're you rebelling against?\ Whaddya got?\ 
A Master Of His Craft Earle Is Caught Trying Too Hard 
It grows and grows but never blooms....... 
Disappointing 
Joni compilation albums and Geffen Records

Hit or miss electro-rock with a punk vibe. 
Decadence is intended to not be taken too literal

Good production value wearisome vocals 
Not A Dance Album 
This Greek Goddess Should Stick With The Traditional Songs 
Not quite as good as the debut but still good 
At least turn on some kinda light.. 
Just not quite as good as 'Bright Lights' 
Good enough 
Good follow up but no Turn On The Bright Lights 
Interpol: \ANTICS\ 
Sophomore Slump for Interpol? 
I Like Antics 
The bright lights have sorely dimmed... 
hmmm...well......hmmmmm 
A little death a little art 
alright 
um...okay sure 
alright cd 
Average Metal 
I was expecting a bit more from a major label debut 
Solid Thrash Metal

Average. It could have been better. 
Pretty Good Set 
THE BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE................. 
Who is Jill Scott Again? 
Whew..

Pretty but boring 
Harmonium by Vanessa Carlton 
3-1/2 stars -- She's got a unique talent 
An amazing potential that has yet to be entirely fulfilled. 
Pleasant but nothing earth-shattering 
Harmony on Harmonium 
and a half... 
Off to a good start 
One song for the time capsule and a bunch of promise 
Average (at best) 
Promises of Promise 
Good Effort; Lots of Potential; Nalick shouldn't be afraid to move out of her Comfort Zone 
Good songs lots of potential terrible production 
Where is album no. 2? 
Something to look forward to

Juelz Santana ----- What the Game's Been Missing! 
Sophomore Jinxbut still good 
pretty good 
Quite Nice. 
3 1/2. Step ur lyrics up Juelz... 
This Sophmore effort is NOT that good 
Would they lie to you? 
I Was Thinking Of Something Sleek To Wrap Around My Tender Throat. 
Where Is Don't Ask Me Why? 
A quick but enjoyable look at their U.S. & U.K. hits respectively... 
+1/2 -- Modern country-pop from American Idol 
This was Good Not Great 
One of the strongest American Idol albums 
Good but lacking 
Oh There's Nothing Like Oklahoma 
Duets: The Final Chapter by The Notorious B.I.G. 
Forever King of New York 
(3.5 Stars) R.I.P. Biggie Smallz 
Biggie's Ready To Die but Puff won't let him 
let the man rest in peace 
my honest opinion 
Decent final chapter 
Biggie's Last Album Ends Up Very Limited 
Meh 
Nice Soothing Romantic Set 
A BIT SKIMPY & LACK OF VARIETY COMPARED TO 1ST CD 
Needs some work listen to the mixtape 
Fort Minor - The Rising Tied 
Nice concept and ideas 
An Album that Almost Gets it Right 
3-1/2 Stars -- Holding his own on his own 
Too Much Hype!!! 
(3.5 Stars) Good Effort....But Still Needs Some Fine Tuning. 
The real \baby\ of Cash Money 
Not badbut missing Manny Fresh

Average to me 
this album aint all that 
I ALL READY KNEW THIS WAS NOT GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS CATER VOL1...NO DISS TO WAYNEBUT HIS FLOW IS STARTING TO SOUND LIKE JAY-Z 
Not great but not that awful 
Don't belive the hype 
A crossroad at the height of their career 
Until The Breakthrough... 
Not as good as the rest 
MJB:doing Her Best Mariah 
The Breakthrough 
Mediocre 
Honestly...... 
More Mary: Not Broken (or Fixed) 
Impressive gets better with each listen! 
PLEASE put the pen down Shakira 
Catchy in its own way 
Need To Wash & Dried In The Laundromatic!! 
I didn't develop a 'Fixation' for this album...... 
Nothing to be fixated about 
Volume 1 gets the prize. 
HOW DOES SHE DOES? 
It just kills me to write this... 
A Step Back 
Uncle Woody meets R.Kelly 
They're great...Which means they're not (see title of CD please) 
Unfair Expectations 
A Lesser Imitation... 
Keeps rock'n' roll going along fairly well 
A good first effort (but interesting to see if they grow) 
Not All That Great 
A Greatest Hits That Needs Improvement..... 
Barely gives me a buzz. 
A Good Starter Set but not Definitive-- 
good but not what I expected 
Luda & DTP 
(3.5 Stars) Better Than The 1st DTP Album But Still Room To Improve! 
Decent CD from an okay group. 
Not Luda 
pretty good Isley's album 
Solid collection with some very notable omissions 
pretty good Hits package 
Rock and roll is built on shopping. 
Madonna is still the master 
One more item of your OCD 
Not quite all of Oates and Hall. 
DRS said \This Is For...MY HOMIES!\  That's About All This CD Is For! 
Scarface should have left some of his \Homies\ at home this time around 
A Good Album from Scarface 
Strong Cd i wish there was more scarface on it 3.5 
Definitely not an album with general appeal 
new good and old still good 
yeah yeah 
YES ! (but only for die hard fans or as starting point) 
3-1/2 stars -- An improvement but he's still got some evolving to do 
It's Not Raw Enough (2.5 Stars) 
Robin Thicke's Got A Love Jones 
3 1/2 stars. Nice. 
A Pleasant Suprise But 'Deluxe Edition' ? NO WAY! 
Music in the Genes! 
3-1/2 stars -- Not quite purr-fect but still good 
The Don sounds a little tired. Some of the songs do too. 
Three stars is like dancing with your sister 
Whatever Happened to the H gang? 
Still Undecided. 
Good value but still missing many rare remixes?! 
Where's The Extended Versions Of \Erotic City\\Head\\Sexy Dancer\ and \Party Up\?? 
A DISSERVICE 
Ultimate Prince...? 
His royal badness 
Everytime I Hear This! 
the mainstreaming and death of vocal trance 
Not What I Expected! 
It's a good album but... 
trim the songs back 50% next time 
Where are the melodies? 
At War with the Mystics 
they might be human after all.... 
Less lingering 
Every Time You State Your Case 
What exactly does he want to do? 
LL 
Still Solid After All These Years.... 
UNCLE L 
You Need To Control Yourself! 
(3.5 Stars) 'Todd Smith' Gives Us An Okay Album....AGAIN!!! 
Is it a comeback for LL? 
A good effort for the veteran original \Prince of Rap\ 
Commercial But Got it's Fair Share of Good Songs 
A LOT of Filler 
Probably the only good cd out there. 
The CD has grown on me 
pretty cool elo album 
Good compilation of hits and history of the band 
Not the best of their stuff 
A Better Album Than Their First 
The potential is still there... 
THIS album should have been called Amerika'z Nightmare 
Its aight...need to get used to some of these songs. 
Mobb Deep - Blood Money 
Party's over tell the rest of the crew 
Slightly dissapointed... 
Mobb Deep took 50 Cent's \Blood Money\ so don't expect \The Infamous\ or \Murda Muzik\ anymore. 
Not Really that Bad Not Really that Good 
Dissapointing and weak for an MD joint not totally horrible. 
Dissapointment 
Actually it's a 3.5 effort... 
RED HOTS Fade to GREY 
Mainstream fare and overrated 
Here's my two cents. 
Not As Good As I Hoped It Would Be 
Pink Warm Cherry Tomatoes 
Twice as many winners twice as much junk 
There's a great single album in here. 
Would Be Much Better As A Single Disc 
Homogeneous Production Stifles Virtues 
As VIBE Magazine said \Not on THESE streets\ 
Not Bad I hoped that it would've been better 
very good 
(Rating 6 Out Of 10): It's A Good Experimental Album Just Not For Me... 
They Say I'm CRAAAAYYYZZAAAAYYY! 
I hate when record companies do this 
Nothing Fits Quite Like Polyester. 
Not Quite An MVP 
Why only three stars? Well... 
Not an equal partnership 
'Pimpalation' Doesn't Live Up To The UGK Name. 
This is gonna be a real killa for himself! 
3.5 Stars not bad but not too good either 
5th Time Arround 
TIMING CAN BE A KILLA...... 
KILLA! 
Yes this is a departure 
Pretty good for a freshman album. 
Between two extremes. 
Good first album from Yung Joc 
20/20 hearing with unnecessary corrective surgery 
rapping and good production 
What? Someone actually cares about a Field Mob album? 
(3.5 Stars) Field Mob Getting Better With Time 
its the new mob 
Beneath The Field Mob Standard  {3 Stars}

Liking It - 3.5 stars 
Could've been so much more... 
Just saw Nellie Furtado at the halftime of 94th Grey Cup in Winnipeg Canada. Folklure Loose ain't...

LeToya 
Just okay 
Unfortunately 2006 Doesn't Belong To Dmx! :( 
Same ol' s*it 
Why have the definitive when the Ultimate is coming?? 
not  bad for the New Steely Dan Fan or Casual 
The collection earns four stars but this re-release concept barely gets two stars. Why you ask? 
Waiting for 'Watley' 
Ridin' medium 
It's not \Living Legends\ but \Ridin' High\ is still worth checking out

Mediocrity runs in the family 
Good but not as hot as others claim.

The First Album of the Rest of Norah's Career

Not her best but still an interesting album to listen to 
Mediocre at best 
A gossamer grab-bag of European air. 
Flawed but brave project 
the bird and the bee mp3 
solid but a bit too sugary for my taste 
space puffs in my mind 
Decent But Not Their Best

A bit askew

Not quite a Nightmare; Hardly a Favourite 
great band but this one disapoints 
Breathe deeply . . . 
A bit of Test For Echo syndrome

If Regina Spektor Were Israeli... 
Some good moments at least no awful ones 
Elton-lite 
Not Elton's Worst Though Far From His &quot;Fantastic&quot; Years 
Some great music - pity about the lyrics 
Elton less Bernie 
Fans can never be objective... 
Solid Elton John album has its share of filler 
Not bad 
Downloaded it for free. Not sure I would pay for the whole album

Basically Jeff Lynne is ELO. 
Inspired to Tedious.  Exciting to Unaffecting. 
An ambitious bombastic whimper 
I hear... 
Pretty if somewhat monotonous 
Two Styles - One is Great 
a lot of money for lo-fi 
I kinda want to like it (or lick it?)

Some Stains on this Album 
Bright flashy beautiful but too unoriginal 
hmm not that good 
Department store tunes that occasionally shine 
One to watch but the cat's gotta go.

Pop Rock 
Vintage Alanis but... 
A Slight Return To Form

self-indulgent and flawed but fun

Funked up...

Review of Vinyl Version 
Okay! 
Overplayed 
I like 2 songs the album was cheap so I got it. 
I'm sitting on the fence about MUSE... 
It's not a good album or a bad album. It's just a Muse album. 
3 1/2 really good songs not much else 
Music for backgrounds 
Centipedal to the Metal 
Not up to par 
Free 
Not Their Best Work But Still Enjoyed It 
Unfortunately not more of the same 
Not all i thought this would be 
+1/2 - A country legend's farewell studio session 
A handful of solid tracks but a loudness wars disaster and weaker songwriting than on Tame Impala's debut 
Maybe a Sophmore flop 
A few catchy songs but it did not blow me away 
Trying to like this band 
Try and buy the few songs you like 
Breathing Fire 
Not near as enjoyable as their last CD unfortunately... 
Nearly ruined by lyrical laziness... 
Has some good qualities but not for me. 
Not bad 
How Do You Ruin Me? 
Odd but you might like it if you like odd. 
between two and three stars
