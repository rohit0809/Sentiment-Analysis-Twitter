OKAY for Price 
hello sugar rush! 
So gross tasting! 
Sorry Panda Puffs my kids didn't like 
I can barely taste any Peanut Butter 
too much sugar 
Arrived Broken and Crushed/Powder 
peppermint stick candy 
Eh... I don't know 
unhappy babyboomer 
not the best tasting stuff 
Major side effect is an issue for me 
I know it's not a soda 
Sorry I \Switched\ back! 
An OK flavor but not as great as I expected 
Cherry - Really? 
The Switch...but from what? 
Too sweet for me 
Belch juice 
Reading this description you would think... 
Taste like fermented cherry 
Taste is only fair not worth the money 
Very Cherry 
Tastes like cherry syrup. 
Not bad yet nothing great -- way overpriced 
Kiddy Soda POP 
Healthy Alternative to Soda - But Tastes Terrible! 
I liked another Switch but not THIS one 
Not worth 130 calories 
Expensive Bubbling Fruit Juice 
don't get this flavor 
This tastes more like apples than cherries! 
Not for me 
Syrupy... 
carbonated marachino cherry juice 
Carbonated juice 
weird 
Only a little bit more good for you than sodas 
not bad but not great either 
Carbonated Black cherry juice in a can 
Okay not great 
Another great concept with not-as-great execution. 
Better with a splash of vodka 
Not really the best of either world 
If you're into Black Cherry or Cherry Coke 
Why? 
Too sweet 
Blah 
Disappointing Grape Flavor Not As Tasty as Other Switch Flavors 
I tried these to replace my Mt. Dew habit. 
Confused as to what it wants to be 
tinged with vitamin C 
Bubble liquid 
Pricey sugar okay taste 
Decent tasting but too small and overpriced 
Nothing like they promise rather nasty tasting 
Some Things Were Not Meant to be Carbonated 
It was - Ok... 
A Muddy Orange Flavor 
Switch?  Ummm ... no. 
Very harsh too-sweet flavor. 
Not So Bold Soda Alternative 
Well it's better than the black cherry anyway 
Would Not Switch 
I had high hopes am a bit disappointed 
It is tart! 
Tastes like an energy drink 
High Sugar + Acidic Taste =  Not Ready to Make the Switch 
Didn't like the flavor aftertaste or quantity 
Not a fan has an odd taste - Carbonation in minimal 
My least favorite of the four I tried 
Carbonated orange juice in a can 
only so-so.... 
Strange... 
Not as tasty as it could be 
Not so good 
cloying 
Meh... 
No. 
Too Sweet - Too Late

Not my favorite 
Didn't Taste Great! 
small size and mediocre taste 
Not Bad but Not Great 
unwholesome 
Too sweet for my tastes. 
Strike Three... you're out! 
Not Up to Par Taste-wise 
Not enough Kiwi or Berry and too much filler juices 
Technically drinkable. 
Too sweet high calories. 
Not a huge enough difference over regular juice or soda 
Tasty But Gimmicky 
Sweet sugary soda 
Not quite my cup of tea 
Left Me Thirsty But Not For This...

Couldn't really find the Kiwi's or the Strawberries 
Overly Sweet candy flavor 
Lots of calories and carbs 
Where's the flavor? 
Way too tart for my taste 
Not a fan of flavored carbonated water 
way too sweet 
Still too much carbonation 
Tastes like bubblegum 
Crisp taste but high in carbs/sugars 
No sugar but awfully sweet-and not in a good way 
Different 
Tastes like Carbonated Plastic.... 
Tastes pretty good BUT.... 
Syrupy 
Not impressed

Too acidic 
Too Syrupy Sweet for Adult Pallettes Think Jolly Rancher 
Way too sweet! 
Not what I expected 
no switching to this drink 
Extremely SWEET is not a good thing! 
Not for me 
Tasty?. . . Yes. . . Worth the price? . . . No 
We won't be making the Switch 
Tastes like a fizzy Jolly Rancher 
too sweet for me 
Tasty for the kiddies I guess. 
Syrupy sweet taste 
Yuck 
Shouldn't Watermelon or Strawberry be the first ingredients? 
Read the label carefully 
Very sweet and sugary but full of calories 
Costs Like an Organic Tastes Like a Generic (Another Redneck Perspective) 
Not what I expected (and not in a good way) 
Tastes like carbonated apple juice! 
Not a low calorie drink 
Like Liquid Candy! Yum? Not so much. 
Tasty but a Little Too Sweet 
Weak watery taste. 
Yuck! 
Sweet and Metallic 
Needs more work 
Expensive product that tastes cheap and cady-like. 
Too Strongly Flavored & \Watermelon\ is the LAST Ingredient! 
Not overly sweet but not great tasting either 
Sounds better than it actually taste. 
Waste of money 
Not in boxes and not fresh 
So so 
Made in China 
won't order again 
Thought it would be better

Not the same oatmeal I grew up with 
Where's the brown sugar?  Not here! 
What happened??? 
Stick to the original 
Very sweet

Corn Syrup Formula 
Not so gentle... 
Contains corn syrup i.e. fructose linked to addiction & liver damage 
Number one ingredient is corn syrup solids 
First Ingredient is Corn Syrup Solids 
Decent nutrition but refused multiple times by breastfed toddler 
remove the corn syrup and try again 
Why? 
Contains corn syrup solids i.e. fructose linked to addiction & liver damage 
Completely unnecessary but moms always want to do what's \best...\ 
Refuses most of the time 
Yummy and easy but expensive.

Sucralose Inside! 
More Tea Than Lemonade...Let Alone Berries

Yes I prefer brewed iced tea but this just tastes nasty 
Bad taste 
Iced - Not so hot

Gummie-like candy with corn syrup and sugar as the first two ingredients ... where's the fruit? 
No strawberries were harmed in the making of this product 
Healthy Packaging Hiding Same Old Sugar 
20% Fruit (Sort of) and Not Vegetarian 
Poor packaging to food ratio 
Pretty \meh\ for a fruit snack 
A little disappointed in Kellogg's 
With a name like \Harvest Acres\ it should be organic.. 
There are better fruit-flavored snacks if they don't have to be strawberry 
There are better \natural\ fruit snacks on the market 
What's sweeter than any sweetener?  THESE! 
No berries were harmed in the making of these *fruit snacks 
Welch's and Target Marketplace fruit snacks are better

Good Though The Olive Oil Is A Bit Overwhelming 
Tasteless 
Yummy but VERY mild 
Can't recommend it 
too much oil 
Just Okay

A misleading way to sell oily tuna 
It may have Omega-3 but that's all 
Not Tasty 
dry low on Omega-3 
Overbearing flavorings not balanced or mild 
Artificial 
Had high hopes but...

Requires far too much to really be noticed 
Not worth the price

Sorry no Cigar for this one........ 
Not horrible but not great 
LET'S GET WEIRD FLAVOR: Not so good to me 
Do you really want your coffee roasted by a cable comedy channel? 
A failed experiment in my house 
Similar to canned vegetables 
A pretty expensive way to get a small amount of vegetables 
Good idea but so far this isn't for me. 
Half the box gone and I can sort of see the novelty... 
a waste. 
Doesn't taste like coconut 
Too weak for me
