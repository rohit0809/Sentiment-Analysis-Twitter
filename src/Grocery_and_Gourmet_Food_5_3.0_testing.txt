Too strong for this household 
Just like the gas stations serve 
fair not very espresso like 
Not bad not great... 
The regular flavor is superior 
Just O.K.

Meh 
Satisfy your sweet tooth with these 
Smooth creamy and just a little bland

Okay but not great 
Taste great but worth the price?!? 
Slightly better than average chocolate 
Smooth creamy rich 
Good but not great 
If you already like Werther's you might like these 
Pretty good but a little TOO sweet with a corn-syrupy chocolate taste... 
Soft Milk Chocolate with Caramel; Not the Werther's I Know I Love 
Could have been a bit better! 3 stars. 
Decently tasty a little expensive

I want the original hard candy instead 
Not bad but not my favorite

Not What I Expected 
Better than plain chocolate

Good but not great... 
Not the greatest... 
Is there such a thing as BAD chocolate? 
Everyday chocolates 
Caramel doesn't stick to bad teeth 
Tasty but not quite creamy or rich...and high in fat 
Not too bad 
Definitely not the Werther's I grew up with... 
Great tasting candy but lacking much of the original Werther's flavor

Hoping for more of a wow factor.. 
Don't go by what I think of this product because I purchased the wrong product and never used it. 
Three Stars

Boost Kid Essentials 
Very nutritious my kids not thrilled with the taste 
NOT ON BOARD.................... 
Somewhat tasty chocolatey packed with nutrients; also unfortunately packed with sugars

Tastes like Nesquik not sure it is worth it 
Out of all the flavors I liked this one the least. 
It's tuna... 
Disappointed

Loved The Concept 
Really Strange 
True apple taste 
Great Package Mediocre Taste/Texture ... 
Good but an apple is better 
Pretty good apples 
Taste great not filling 
So-so - Seems to have been overly sweetened 
Meh... 
Core included? 
Texture might be an issue for some 
Convenient but not a great value 
I Was Looking For a PG Tips Replacement 
The tea is ok... 
Fantastic price; there is some impurity 
not sure yet 
Sweet smell 
not organic but smells and tastes good 
Just like what it said 
unpleasantly surprised 
Weak flavor boasts a great impression though. 
Okay nothing outstanding 
Country of origin? 
Yep its hot!!  What is the country of origin??? 
I bought it. Now what am I supposed to ... 
Jerky 2 
This is not ground. It's powder

I hope you like mint a LOT 
I was disappointed with this 
Not bad but a little weak in taste and smell. 
Delicious smoky flavor--but claim of \organic\ is untrue 
NO directions 
Not for cooking just for drinks 
Lifetime supply 
These are good quality at a good price... 
Only cream colored maca 
Decent Vanilla Taste #1 Ingredient is water #2 Ingredient is SUGAR

A mix of positive and negative 
Essentially a Drink

HARD TO COME UP WITH TITLE 
Not very sweet and expensive. 
Super Sugar 
Good addition to a salad 
Probably not worth the price 
Better than white; not as good as wheat 
Serviceable pasta; need to comparison shop for price 
Okay not as healthy as you'd think 
Not Exactly White Taste 
Tasty but there are healthier choices 
;0) 
mixed feelings 
Stays chewy not grainy 
I prefer the thinner noodles version of this pasta since they come out more tender 
Strong whole wheat taste 
Only 51% Whole Wheat..... 
Not up to snuff 
Wasn't bad but it wasn't good either... 
Hard to find locally but overpriced online. 
Not what we expected 
Tastes like oily fish 
Sold down the river 
Hotter than I Expected (due to added \chili flavor\) 
Heat but not much taste 
Interesting But Not For Fish Tacos! 
Too spicy for easy work 
Decent but nothing out of the ordinary overall 
Okay 
Nothing Special...Just Okay 
I love King Oscar but I like to control the heat 
funky taste - maybe from the olive oil ? 
Hot & spicy 
Like a time-bomb for the tastebuds 
Hmmm 
Delicious 
Nice treat 
Good tasting good value high sodium and fat tasty noodles

Nice flavor of ginger but it's a light tea. 
Not much flavor prefer yerba mate for similar results

Nice taste but the smell! 
3.5 Stars for me 
You might like this for chai - not my cup of tea 
Don't Steep Too Long The First Time You Try It 
The ginger is rather weak... 
weak cardamom flavor 
Try the cardamom flavor instead; this one's a bit blah 
Nothing Special Not Very Gingery 
Not as good as the cardamon 
Just Okay 
Smell of cardamom almost masks the funky odor of the tea 
Where's the Cardamom? 
Perhaps a good tea but better options for Ginger lovers 
A Connoisseur's Tea 
Great black tea with a hint of ginger. 
Pu-Erh is a unique and complex flavor - I like it but ginger just doesn't work here 
Tasted more of dried ginger than pu'er 
NUMI pushing the Pu'erhs these days 
Tastes OK but not good enough for me 
Not very ginger-y 
Not Quite My Cup of Tea (Pun Intended)! 
Strong And Earthy: The Ginger Is Somewhat Subdued In The More Pronounced Pu'ehr Flavor 
3.5 Stars Better Iced 
Not Enough Pu'erh 
Strange tea conditional praise 
Where's The Cardamom? 
Very mild muted flavors with little ginger taste 
Not bad but not something I'll buy again 
Cardamom Pu'erh Tea Bags 
NOT WHAT I EXPECTED 
Good Tea 
I wanted to like this. 
If you need a kick this will get ya 
Needs more ginger! 
Nice ginger overtones 
Very Strong but Good 
Not for me - Strong and earthy 
Cardamon seems weak 
Not my favorite 
An interesting change from \regular\ tea 
I like that it's organic but flavor too mild for me 
Strong tea... Consider adding cream! 
Just okay 
I wish the ginger flavor was stronger 
Meh.... 
Great Company Ethics Mediocre Tea 
Smells delicious. Tastes like water. 
Acquired taste.. 
It's A Lot Better Than The Cardamom Pu'erh Tea 
Unique Flavor &#9679; Pricey &#9679; NOTE: \HIGHER CAFFEINE\ 
A little too much 
bland 
Woody flavor with barely a hint of cardamom 
I don't think I liked it 
Numi seems just ok to me a bit overpriced and odd fish smell 
mildly pleasant cuppa 
Health benefits vs. taste 
Mild hint of ginger 
better price at costco... 
Dilute and runny 
Great price not so great product. 
Hesitated because it was Grade B

Good idea but too much rice syrup for a nutrition bar and too dry as a dessert

They seem to go stale FAST! 
Good Nutritional Value but Taste Like Stale Cookies. 
not as great as I'd imagined 
flavor was not for me but some people may like these quite a bit 
I really like these; nutty snacks 
Good except for added ingredients 
tastes pretty disgusting but works 
Weaker than Regular Sleepytime 
Seems to work but it's hard to rinse 
3 stars for convenience little else 
important to know the size 
Picture looks better than the actual item. 
It looks a lot nicer in the picture than in actuality! 
Check the ingredients and compare... 
Too sweet for me..Not as crunchy as I'd like.

A little better than the Caffe flavor....maybe it's the cocoa.

Not A Product I Would Go Out OF My Way To Buy

very \coffee\ 
OK coffee drink 
Good but price is way too high 
Too sweet 
Tastes...Ok 
it's coffee. in a can. it's illy issimo. 
It's ok for a quick hit of iced espresso

Okay.  I like the strong mint. 
Not really minty but very spicy 
Not really my cup of tea... 
Another Take on Mint 
Robust European Style Tea 
It's average... 
mint tea 
The taste is very mild - and it was only so so on the energizing 
Delicious but expensive 
Okay taste just not for me. 
Not enough energy... 
A matter of taste 
Nothing special 
Too Mild 
Won't Kill My Coffee Habit But It's Alright 
Good taste Energy? Not so sure 
Great flavor helps me focus but still leaves me with jitters 
The perfect energy might be coming from the caffeine boost instead of the herbs!  It also doesn't have much flavor. 
Great Product Great Price! 
Army brat food.. 
Shipping takes it's toll 
A gift for someone who lives far away and you don't think about that much?

Different textures makes this buyer weary. 
A bunch of different cereals in one box 
This Will Not Be Making It Into My Breakfast Rotation 
Could be worse should be better 
Almost great but a little too sweet and a little too much vanilla

Better if it were just the curry paste and not a kit 
Not for everyone 
Good to add to soup 
For Skilled Chefs Only. 
A product in need of a better label 
OK 
instructions were wrong 
As Expected 
Peacock Brown Rice

No unpleasant buzz but not as much boost as I like. 
Not as effective as 5-hr Energy

Comparatively not bad... 
The Red Rain Energy Shot tasted good but the drink did not give me a shot of energy.

I'm not sure who this would be for 
This is nothing to get too terribly excited about.

More of a \Kid\ Cereal 
Super crunchy. Get out your magnifying glass to see a nut. 
Maybe better as a mix 
Reminds me of corn bran... 
Crunchy but not nutty... 
Very sugary and probably not the most healthful cereal

Tasty questionable texture chocolate was melted 
There are better choices out there. 
Not a bad tea cookie 
Bland 
Interesting Taste But With A Few Problems 
Soft and Melted 
Good flavor but needs improvement - chocolate melted 
Bland granola 
Okay Granola 
Ultra Crunchy and Sweet Granola 
Not The Best 
Just fine tasty but unremarkable and a little stingy with the almonds 
Average except for the Agave 
Just OK. 
Healthier than many other granolas but kind of blah 
tastes good but not for vegans 
OK granola but lacking in vanilla and almonds 
Good Flavor 
Pack of 6 is too much 
No crunch 
disappointing because it doesn't taste like tea 
Create a tea 
Awesome tasting convenient tastes great but... 
Great product poor flavor 
Peachy but not peachy keen. 
Not the best of the flavors 
Unpleasant After Taste 
Artificial Taste no Nutritional Value and Questionable Ingredients..Are You Ready to Try? 
So portable! 
interesting... 
Not Their Best Flavor 
Good but I'll stick to my CL flavors 
a little too tart..... 
Another pretty good drink mix from MIO 
It's not too bad 
Tastes good and is easy to take with you cost is slightly high 
Just okay 
Not your mother's peach tea 
Peach Tea MiO 
Needs a little more tea and a little less peach 
Convenient green not bad tasting but nutritionally questionable 
Decent But Not Really Special... 
Not bad not great 
Makes ordinary water easier to swallow 
Peach yes. Tea? 
It's Okay 
Pretty Good... 
BETTER THAN PLAIN   NOT AS GOOD AS MANGO PEACH 
weird taste 
Blah 
Tastes ok but.. 
Good but Too Sweet for My Taste 
Great concept but peach flavor is underwhelming 
MIo Peach Tea 
It's ok... 
Could be peachier. 
convenient slight hospital taste alcohol based sugars 
Good Idea 
Not the best 
Better than Mango/Peach and Sweet Tea in my opinion 
Not bad but not good either 
Make your own flavored water 
Tasty 
Nice idea for a product but I don't like this flavor 
Concentrated flavor 
Watch out! 
Not bad taste but really fake coloring 
Delicious at first but leaves a stale after-taste 
Great concept but odd artificial peach taste... 
Taste is very subjective but for me this makes water taste worse than it does out of the tap. 
A Little Goes a Long Way 
Peach in an artificial sort of way also super sweet 
Yummy but some concern over ingredients 
Okay in Small Amounts 
Great Concept Handy and Portable but Very Sweet 
Great idea ok taste 
Decent product good tasting but doesn't seem that cost effective 
A Bit TOO Sweet 
Sweet and sweet... no mango with a hint of peach for me 
OK 
I hated it. My roommate loved it. 
Tastes OK but leaves a strange feeling in back of throat 
Great tasting diet tea... sometimes 
The most I taste it the less I like it 
It Is OK 
taste is OK and it is sweet 
Not our favorite 
Not terrible but I wouldn't buy again 
Not really to my taste 
Tastes great but too artificial for my tastes. 
2% natural = 98% chemical 
An alternative to Crystal Light 
It's Okay 
Cheaper to Buy Flavored Water 
It's okay 
Expensive - but tasty 
HANDY PACKAGING  TASTE OKAY 
Good stuff but not worth the price 
too expensive 
Rather insipid flavor but easy to use 
tasty but not worth it 
Tastes okay . . . for a glassful of chemicals 
Better than the tea! 
No thank you.... 
Not Bad Flavor for Water 
Serving Size = 1/2 tsp. 
Tastes Good. Not Sure If Worth the Money. 
Expensive and Mediocre 
Product arrived spilled. 
Tasty but with an artificial aftertaste. 
It's Ok 
Adult Kool Aid 
I hate it when my water looks like wine 
Beats MiO Sweet Tea 
Pretty good 
portable but difficult to measure 
Concoct your own flavored water 
It's OK but I think I like my water un-enhanced. 
Good taste but a messy travel companion 
Way too sweet if you slavishly follow instructions 
Yeah adds some nice flavor but chemical after-taste... 
Can't taste the mango. 
Tastes good but leaves an after-taste 
Like the taste ... not the packaging 
MIO...How sweet it is.... 
Tea for 24 
Peach flavor tastes artificial.... 
Not bad... 
Not So Peachy 
Well-designed container OK nondescript flavor not too keen about the ingredients 
Careful when opening!  Mixed reviews from family on taste certainly can be useful. 
It's better when I mix it with something else 
It's OK if you like artificial sweeteners 
Expensive Maybe Not Worth the Price 
MIO Strawberry Watermelon 
A big disappointment 
Average at best 
Good to take while on the road traveling 
Better than plain water 
I don't get it..... 
Flavor fine user-friendliness fine 
Nothing special 
couldn't review this 
OK Flavor.  Mimics Sweet Tea But Not Quite the Same. 
Better than what I expected it to be 
My daughter loves it......and I don't. 
The packaging is ingenious the concept is great... but this flavor was not a hit in this house 
I have a hard time getting the right flavor for this. 
Useful but... 
Great For Athletic People/Gym Rats 
The Third MIO Flavor I've Tried... 
Just okay 
Easy tea ready to dress up as you see fit 
Not quite tea 
FLAVOR DOES NOT EQUAL THE CLEVER IDEA 
Fake tea flavor 
A Nice Surprise! 
Not bad but I wouldn't carry it in my pocket 
Oh Mio Myo You. Whatever Shall We Do? 
Great Idea but Too Much Aftertaste 
Tastes OK and handy but prefer real H2O or tea 
Tastes good & convenient - but hard to judge amount 
It Tastes Better Than Water But..... 
A Nice Treat 
1/2 tsp = a serving; use within a month of opening; no refrigeration required 
Almost did not try this 
It's ok but not a great substitute for the real thing 
Cool design great idea not great flavor. 
Better than plain water but not great 
A good idea 
OK kind of a funny taste 
Concoct your own flavored water 
Not quite Sweet Tea but good! 
Not a fan of the Sweet Tea flavor.. 
Tastes too artificial for me 
I've Had Better Water Enhancers 
Great packaging/idea but mediocre flavor 
Sweet Tea by the drop 
So-So 
A little bit too sweet for my taste but tastes exactly like it says 
Not bad...even though it doesn't taste like sweet tea 
It's OK 
An Alternative to Carbonated Beverages 
Absolutely artificial. But it tastes good.

Spicey Eggnog coffee 
Not much Eggnog flavor 
Nice strong spicy egg nog flavor 
I was expecting x-mas 
Funky aftertaste 
Cute basket with lots of nice chocolates but the truffles didn't look right. 
Quality and Convenience vs. Quantity and Time 
Nice chocolate way too expensive 
5 for flavor; 1 for price. If price is not a factor... 
Fair 
Tea is OK 
Very mild not my cup of tea 
premium fresh stacks 
Tasty review? Not really. Necessary product? Not really either. 
Right-Size Packaging Needs Right-Size Pricing 
Taste fine but trans fat and small package premium 
New concept on an already great product 
Just different packaging 
Did Nabisco change their recipe? 
Interesting 
Not a cookie - more like a digestive biscuit 
newtons tries something different 
Not really a huge fan of these 
Light but sticky 
A Crunchy Cookie with Mixed Results 
Tasty cookie from trusted Nabisco but too fragile for shipping 
Not bad but not great either. 
Very tasty snack 
Tasty but Those Troublesome Dried Fruit 
I like these but the kids are not sure... 
C+ Concensus on Crispy Cranberry Cookie 
Crispy crunchy hearty. 
One out of two in my family like these 
Not a terribly healthy choice 
Pretty good with hot coffee 
Decent Healthy Cookie But Needs More Cranberry 
Okay taste. 
An Adult Treat 
Pretty good 
Mostly Harmless 
Not bad but what's the point when fig bars are so yummy? 
Not very figgy 
Okay taste for whole grain snack but 47 calories per cookie 
Not a big hit.... 
Newtons Fruit Thins 
Mediocre 
not bad... 
Not as good as the original 
Taste peaks so does the price

Addicted to original so why change? 
Just OK

Bland Entry in a Crowded Market 
Kind of dry.... 
Crunchy biscuit no obvious fig or honey flavor

Meh 
A tasty snack with one small caveat. 
A little bland but good with coffee... 
Nothing Special 
Reasonable Cookie - Palm Oil is a Concern 
Da Better Flavor but still I've eaten better 
Smelled better than they tasted 
They were just ok for me. 
Decent cookie but horrible aftertaste 
Tastes like a digestive biscuit with vestiges of fig 
mediocre cookies 
Like a graham cracker with fruit 
Tasty but Not as Good as Original Newtons 
Do not think \cookie\ 
Call it a Cinnamon 'Thin' with fig bits for a more accurate name. 
Good but not the best for dieters 
Nothing Special 
Not an exciting product. 
Just okay 
A British Tea Biscuit? Really? 
A bit too sweet 
Misleading name but good anyway

natural flavor? 
Good for peanut butter & jelly sandwiches

You Can Really Smell The Blueberry 
A bit too dry and crunchy

Probably 3 1/2 stars 
if you want healthier these are good 
Good taste but be aware  of the packaging unless you want \cookie pieces\ 
Good snack food 
Good compromise for kids snacking 
Tastes like a graham cracker with bits of blueberry... 
flavor vs aftertaste 
Honey Maid Fresh Stacks 
Stack-a-licious! 
Familiar taste new packaging worth the price? 
Not Impressed 
Gimmicky packaging 
Ah...Graham Crackers 
too much packaging for me 
Nice Packaging 
Convenient but lacking taste 
A half honey graham cracker is still a honey graham cracker 
Fresh Stack Honey Grahams 
Still got stale easily but a nice thought 
Same Cracker Different Package 
Same treat... a little better package 
Good For On The Go 
Fresh and yummy but was delivered as mostly crumbs 
Great Idea for Freshness But Execution Suffers 
Honey maid... 
less product more money 
Great for travel and snack not anything special for regular eating. 
Same great grahams not much improvement on packaging 
Not for the Health Conscious 
not quite what I was looking for 
Not the best. 
Organic at twice the cost of regular raisins 
An OK shortbread 
Coconut Dream 
A good nut milk 
watery but tasty 
Guayusa is for stoics.

No refrigeration needed 
It's Okay 
TOO MUCH 
An OK Rice Pasta but Don't Overcook 
just ok 
Organic Pure Honey... 
Curious Flavor and Aftertaste 
Tasty but canned in \vegetable oil\ 
Not exactly what I expected

Looks great - Tasted odd 
Sugar Overload! 
Tasty not entirely unhealthy VERY sweet 
not much healthier than \regular\ caramel popcorn 
totally delicious BUT.... 
Tasty But Not Necessarily Worth the Calories/Price 
Caramel Corn = YUM! (fudge drizzle = meh.) 
I would pass 
Cracker Jacks without the Nuts! 
what ain't good for ya is good to ya 
Okay 
Delicious but diminutive 
It's all sugar baby! 
Salty & Sweet But Not Healthier 
Pretty Good but still using corn syrup 
Smartly packaged...but painfully sweet 
Sweet treat 
Decent but would be better without the cheap \fudge\ 
An OK treat 
Sweet and Crunchy 
More fudge-y than carame-ly! 
Over priced for the product 
Depends on What You're Looking For... 
Very very sweet not diet food 
A Bit On The Sweet Side 
Eh What more can I say? 
Chocolate & Popcorn 
Portion control and taste! 
Popcorn Caramel & Chocolate Fix all in one 
Good calorie count but perhaps too sweet 
Good size but just too sweet 
*Extremely* sweet! 
A quick sweet tooth fix 
just your average caramel popcorn 
Be Careful... They are Deliciously Sweet and Yummy 
You can't snack \well\ with corn syrup 
Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is too sweet for my taste 
Good Caramel Weak Chocolate 
A nice low calorie snack option 
a light snack but very sweet and high in sugar 
3-1/2 stars: mixed reviews from a single family 
All Sugared Up With Noplace To Go 
Not that great.  Shouldn't be labeled oreos as they really aren't. 
Ok - sweet but lacking in a distinctive flavor March 24 2011 
Lots of calories and sweetness (not a proper Oreo) 
Not what I expected. 
So... rich... 
Tasty but probably not something to order via Amazon 
If I'm going to pay this much for a cookie I'm going to buy it from a little girl in uniform 
average - not as good as expected 
Not Quite as Good As I Dreamed 
Yes But Is It Still An Oreo? 
Girl Scouts \Tagalong\ by a different name. 
Like a Reese 
Not much Oreo flavor slight artificial aftertaste 
Tagalongs! 
Not enough oreo! 
Thin sweet cookies 
An interesting take on Oreo Cookies 
Greasy but addictive. 
Consider your shipping location carefully! 
Pretty Good Cookie but Not Great 
Not what I expected. 
Different but not as good as just-plain Oreoes 
OK but not the best buy 
Tastes good to me but probably not great for health 
Not the best Oreo 
more of candy treat vs a cookie- MESSY ! 
Not overwhelmed. 
Where's the Peanut Butter? 
Good not great. 
Friend liked'em I did not 
In Search of The Peanut Butter Oreo... 
More Candy Than Cookie and Oh So Sweet! 
Better than the Mint ones still lacking 
Not that great.  Shouldn't be labeled as Oreos. 
Falls short of Oreo perfection. 
Half an Oreo covered in melty fudge 
Cookie Crunch Lost in Peanut Butter and Fudge Creme 
Peanut Butter Oreos...blech 
Good not great 
Peanut Butter Creme.... 
No really an Oreo. 
Nice idea but bitter aftertaste 
Where is the peanut butter or the fudginess? 
Not As Yummy As I Had Hoped 
Pretty generic cookie all told 
High Goo to Cookie Ratio 
Tasty cookies one star off for outrageous price 
This is for the peanut butter creme not golden variety... 
Continuing with the Girl Scout Cookie Theme Mint are Better 
I'll Stick with the Original Oreos 
SUPER CUTE VERRRYY Sweet smell amazing..a weird review... 
Oreo in name only. 
I would not buy them myself 
Very chocolately but offputting texture. 
Somewhat tastier that what I expected for a somewhat healthier snack 
Not my thing but the kids ate them all 
Snackwell Brownie Bites: Dry but Acceptable 
Good in a pinch.

Mixed Reviews 
Good and bad points 
Okay snack but not as good as the real thing... 
State of the Artificial 
Split decision 
Just like mother used to bake...almost 
didn't love these 
Perfectly Portioned Imperfection 
Disappointed at the composition of these \Brownie Bites\ 
Lacking Something 
Lunchbox friendly chocolate snack 
Eh... 
Weird Texture (in a good way) but Not Enough for a Real Snack 
Not so much... 
Not worth the calories carbs and fat 
Not as good as expected 
Dry and Disappointing 
Okay 
Other Products Pack More in 150 Calories 
Just alright. 
Pretty good but... 
Mixed opinions on fudge creme brownie bite 
They're OK. They taste like tiny brownies. 
Needs more chocolate 
Ersatz product with the hint of brownie 
Not my favorite... 
It was OK not amazing 
Doesn't win an \eat this...not that\ contest 
Neat But Not Moist 
A ho-hum confection 
Not bad but Snackwell has other tastier options 
It's okay 
okay 
Probably not the healthiest. 
Great taste Not healthy enough 
Weird sweet 
blah 
Not My Cup of Tea 
Don't like them but kids like these 
A bit too punchy 
crispy snack 
better than candy 
Lior Tahini All Natural 100% Pure Sesame 17.6 Oz (Pack of 4) 
Much better than their spicy ranchero sauce 
Its alright 
Good flavor but doesn't stand out 
Decent flavor for a quick fix 
It Tastes Like Spicy Catalina Dressing 
Not for me 
I'm From New Jersey what do I know about Chipotle? 
Not as good as the other Taco Bell sauces 
Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce 
Better than the Ranchero sauce 
Not spectacular but pretty good 
Just like the restaurant 
Not bad but not something I'd rush out and buy.... 
Tastes Like Spicy Salad Dressing 
Yummy - Expires too Soon 
A nice dip 
very strong with a powdery taste 
Not bad not great just okay 
That's Some Spicy Sauce! 
Great tasting but way too fatty! 
Yum! (maybe) 
All right but not extraordinary 
Not craving it 
Fast Food salad dressing 
Heavy on Smoke and Vinegar 
Okay 
About what you'd expect.  S'okay. 
If you are hungering for some Taco Bell - this is the sauce for you! 
Well they got half of it right ... 
Tricky to meld with my summertime harvest 
Ehhh 
Kind of an interesting taste but nothing I crave 
Just spicy enough - not overwhelming 
Bold and Creamy Chipotle 
Very mild! 
Neither Bold Nor Spicy 
Pretty good but not sure what to do with it yet 
False advertising but tasty
