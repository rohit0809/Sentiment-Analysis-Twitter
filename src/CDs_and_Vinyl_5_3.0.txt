Misfortune of virtue again. 
Handel vs. Sellars 
A voice teacher and early music fan 
To err is Sellars although the singing is divine...

Good 
Should have been better! 
STOMP 
Less than expected 
Not for operatic fans.

too short and too long.... 
An odd experience -- 
I love Woodstock but . . . 
Ultimate Collector's Edition not worth the added expense 
Either the end or the beginning of a dream... 
Less Would Be More 
Da Woodstock Nation Whatever..... 
Woodstock - Blu-ray Info

Conservative performance lacklustre video production 
Classical Music on DVD - like CD's twenty years ago! 
THIS GUY THINKS HE'S BIGGER THAN BEETHOVEN!!!!!  Not! 
Not the best one from Karajan! 
Interesting 
Excellent performance poor video

Pleasant but be forewarned: this is about Sesame Street NOT Elmo! 
Wasn't he always unplugged? 
Love Tony but... 
WHERES THE COMPLETE FOOTAGE? 
Where is the rest of the concert? 
The music too-often takes a back seat to the promoters. 
Great Festival Bad Film 
Good concert footage -- but its a rocumentary first 
the last the largest it could be better 
Controversy? Yes... Music? Not enough 
A True picture of the love and peace era.

Sound Quality 
Disappointed 
Get God Is In The Tv Instead 
Dead to the Viewer 
Marilyn Manson is NOT a normal person 
It's okay 
Great Movie - Mixed Feelings on this edition 
For TON fans but probably not for vampire/movie buffs 
ok 
odd  new Lou Reed.c.d. 
Blondie are doing it for themselves 
Fancy that fancy this. 
Foot at an angle 
Good CD 
Pretty much what you would expect 
This Won't Last 
Its OK but nothing special  with nothing resembling VH 
That's a little more like it..... 
Pitch-correction and mediocre songs - still better than most. 
Not as good as the first one! 
Alright Alright 
Nice Try 
Van Halen rejects don't add up to Van Halen 
Its Slash... 
its ok  not great the singer sounds the same on every song! 
To Be Honest... 
Decent enough follow-up to a brilliant debut 
not my favorite 
a decent album from slash 
Not up to the last Slash album 
Decent Album 
Good album 
Probably my Least Favorite Rush Album 
PLEASE remaster this fine record!! 
After 5 Years of Waiting a Big Disappointment 
It is another Rush Jam Album 
...they just keep powering on - more power to em' 
Starts strong a little repetitive in the middle an uplifting end and a nicely illustrated digital booklet 
Bring back Terry Brown! 
No philosophy consoles me in a clockwork universe. 
Oh if only Terry Brown could get his fingers on this sonic mess 
louder-Louder-LOUDER!!!!! 
Some good songs but mostly ordinary and repetitive 
It is fair to criticize 
Poor mixing/mastering damaged one of their better albums 
Dissapointed a bit 
Not a favorite but not a skeet target either. 
An ambitious work marred by suffocating homogenizing production 
Hmm.... 
I was so ready to love this but... 
They Tried Too Hard 
Geddy Lee just doesnt have it together anymore... Vocal - wise. 
Five stars? Really? Please be sincere! 
SOME GOOD MOMENTS..... 
They are no angels but work like a clock 
Concept lost. This ain't no Hemispheres 
Hmmm! 
A challenging listen..... 
Time to dump Nick Raskulinecz 
I love this album and the new Lovari album 
sick of digital 
Great by today's standards but not one of Rush's best 
Great Rush album damaged by what sounds like poor mastering 
Meh... 
I expected more but it's ok 
Hope Is What Remains to be Seen 
disappointed

Not a bad start for an up-and-coming band 
Good singer- okay music 
A Strong Debut 
Not as good as there EP

Well... After Reading All The Reviews... 
Skillet is alright but not the most solid album ever 
More like two and a half but I'm being nice.... 
Just can't beat Collide this time.. 
I really wanted this album to be as good as Arriving but: 
Progressive Rock with a Heavy Edge 
6.5/10 
Not as good as I remembered 
Reminiscences gone astray 
Not Bad for a White Boy! 
Radical Changes 
too harsh for my taste 
I'll rate it 3 stars for now!! 
WRONGHEADED...This is so greatly BAD 
When questionable intentions go wrong-You have to hear this!!! 
3 stars for being hilarious; 0 for musical talent 
It is what it is 
Total is significantly less than the sum of the parts 
Admirable - As \Swan Lake\ Goes. . . 
I recommend the DVD of the Swedish Ballet as First Choice 
Sing it&#8230; 
Laziness to release this on DVD speaks volumes 
Three and-a-half really. Good but not as good as 'Tales from Margaritavision'. But get both while you can! 
Much more available footage that wasn't given to us.... 
There's nothing like a Grateful Dead concert... 
Mostly unobjectionable 
WHAT?!!  No bonus features?! 
Vintage clips are great - the rest is well.... 
Exposed 
Decent video but had most on other KISS DVDs

Unintentionally Hilarious! 
Dancing Days are hear again! 
Remastering is Great Bonus DVD is Great...but the PACKAGING SUCKS! 
It's unfortunate that this is all we have... 
It's a concert  \CLIP\ 
Not bad at the time 
Great music but. . . 
Good for Zep fanatics. Loses its charm for others. 
Heavily edited 
Better off with the 2003 set 
Led Zeppelin 
Led Zeppelin: The Song Remains The Same - Blu-ray Info

I'd like to say this movie was great but..... 
Inaccurate but highly entertaining and bizarre film best taken as a cult curiosity.  Mediocre DVD treatment though 
A punk classic...you might as well see it.

Good show but can we get a more current one? 
could be better 
Good except for Tannhauser himself 
Well almost.... 
It Grows On You 
ok onli 
Well-crafted but can be quickly tiring 
By far their worst. 
Not as great as it should have been 
Who are we kidding?!! 
20 years later not much has changed 
Not essential but very solid Steely Dan 
Not like the first ones 
Jazz Funkelastic White Boys still Rock! 
Great concept disappointingly executed 
Two Against ...any interest at all. 
Fine CD...But Lacks Great Songs 
babylon brothers 
Steely Dan needs rhythm energy 
Reeling in the Years......... 
Middle of the Road..... 
Yeah the 70's are over but the albums endure 
Way Deep Into Nothing Special 
This is just good enough to buy 
Good Concert  With Engineering Mishap 
where's the centre channel?? 
Pretty Good until She fades 
DTS with no center channel 
Great production cast despite vocal problems of Pendatchanska 
Feelin' so good or not? 
A bit boring in the beginning 
Solid Performance but Disc Exhibits Playback Problems 
Il manque Wakeman! 
psssss 
A brave set full of new songs 
Great visuals but where's the bass? 
You don't really need it 
One new episode doesn't quailfy for a new tape 
end summer revisit 
Misunderstood but not the masterpiece it's made out to be... 
A man is born lives and dies 
The Wall 
To much of roger waters is not a good thing 
An overrated album.... 
WARNING-NO YOUNG LUST! 
A flawed but compelling look at rock stardom 
the most overrated pf album 
The deal's been made.... 
You missed the point. 
Good concept suffers from band loss 
Slick bombastic -- but not a lot of substance 
Definitely a mixed bag 
Does not require buy-in. 
Waters dominated effort hurtling toward a dark and dreary place 
This review is just Another Brick In The Wall... 
Over-rated and unremarkable 
Is it the best or worst Pink Floyd? 
Too much \concept\ not enough \album\. 
I'll go on record and say this.. 
Uneven Wildlly Overrated 
Dissapointing 
Only a few good bricks... 
you have to be in the mood 
Don't  believe the fans...... 
Uncomfortably Numb 
The Wanking Wall 
This is not Pink Floyd!! 
Not as good as original 
The ultimate High School Album and Skating Song 
Average Pink Floyd (3 and a half stars) 
The Wall 
Overrated and self-indulgent 
Overrated 
One of Floyd's Most Popular (and Annoying) Albums 
Overrated but very good... 
Excellent album but constantly blown out of porportion 
Commercial success - Ego inflation - Loss of Floyd sound. 
Heating Up Christian Rock 
Get the cd The book is an acquired taste I suppose. 
Actually I give it 2 and 1/2 stars 
Lovely but can get a bit monotonous 
Melodically Interesting Sonically Dated 
Yanni mix 
A paradoxical bump in the rapid slide into mediocrity. 
Going... going....nearly gone! 
Not my favorite but still good 
Life After Love 
Quarter collaboration 
A Mediocre Effort 
Latte Music 
Is this a new take on Melrose or simply a re-release on another label? 
Good yes.  Great no. 
DISAPPOINTING 
Very Lovely A Little Morose 
What the Hell? 
Not Her Best 
Good Not Great 
\Dare to Dream\- Yanni 
Good Not Great 
A few fun numbers for fans. 
Same old schmaltz 
A gratifying compilation 
not Etta at her best but good if you are an Etta James fan 
Expectation Much Greater Than Reality 
I've Tried Oh How I've tried 
Disappointing 2 and a half stars maybe.... 
5 Stars for The Pokrovsky Singers/2 for Paul Winter 
A Good album 
\Can I stroke you up!\ 
Keep it slow ladies... 
The Kingz of Rock 
If It Ain't Broke... 
Not as tight as their first album 
Great voice that needs to be washed with soap 
Hard Core by Lil Kim (*Back in the Day Series*) 
Sorry y'all I just wasn't feeling it 
Lil' Kim?????? 
Is this the same woman who made Notorious K.I.M & LBM? 
One of the top modern female rappers 
Too much Kim!! 
Decent effort from DJ Pooh 
It's Ok 
Lightning in a bottle (3.5/5) 
Crush on you was my  cut 
3 and 1/2 star effort--aged well in some spots not in others 
PALE BY COMPARISON 
A Great Single A Wonderful First Album but... 
Two-fer of mid-60s UK vocal group's albums + bonus cuts 
Good quality sound but not up to par 
hard to find music 
the well is running dry 
Budgie's 2nd phase 
Okay... 
What's Good Is Cherce But.... 
Mixed deck 
Wouldn't pay too much for it 
Mid '70's return 
Best be your own judge 
It grows on you... 
A good start -- but only a start 
Uneven often strange with blasts of brilliance 
ian 
Amon Duul - 'Psychedelic Underground' (Repertoire) 3 1/2 stars 
Sehr seltsamer Sound 
This is a different band then Amon Duul 2 
Renaissance goes pop! 
Solid Solo Outing 
High Schmaltz 
Roger Daltrey - 'Daltrey' (Repertoire) 
Not the correct Procol harem format I wanted-my error 
cream of the crop 
For the Better Moments Worth the Price 
While the live portion captures the band's proficiency for long jams this is not up to the standard of the album before 
Thunder 
A great single CD's worth of material stretched to 2 CDs 
Disappointed withthe sound quality. 
They Hadn't Quite Figured Out How to Record Loud Bands Yet 
creams wheels of fire still burn somewhat! 
This is not what Cream deserves to be remembered for 
Fresh Cream 
Blues and bluesy rock'n'roll debut not their finest. 65/100 
good 
Just a dollop of Cream at their freshest!! 
Decent...Not a classic 
A Crazy Sound from a Crazy Band 
Opening The \Doors\ 
HiFi Buff 
This is a review of the mp3 download of THE DOORS 
Clean sound but a little disappointed with the surround treatment 
It's the rim-shot baby. 
They did get much higher... 
Don't Buy the MP3 Version if You Want the Full Remix! 
When the music's over rerelease reshuffle repackage remix and remaster it 
A normalized recording that sounds neither analog nor emotional 
radio edited! 
James \Jim\ Morrison was not \all that\ 
Should have purchased the non 40th anniversity edition 
The best and the worst 
Not bad... 
Another L.A. Woman 
DVD-Audio version is decent attempt 
An uneven but worthy finale 
Only for Hard Core Doors Fans 
Attempting the dignified exit 
Over-Rated 
I don't agree with the current conventional wisdom. 
5 Star Album 1 star for stereo remixing 
Nice album maybe if you were there at the time you might enjoy it more 
Not Impressed 
ohmygod! it's Pet Sounds. wuptifreakin'do 
A Bridge too Far 
Not a Beach Boys fan...but 
it's rated over  Revolver? 
NEW STEREO and MONO REMASTERS! Unfortunately a big disappointment.... : ( 
Over Hyped 
Looks like I'm swimming against the tide but whatever 
Nice beach music 
anticlimatic at best 
Not judging the music but the DVD Audio edition 
not even top 10 of 1966 
#2 on RS 500 ..its good but.. 
Disappointing release 
It's good but terribly overrated 
Album is 5 stars DVD-Audio is 1 Star DTS 5 STars 
Wouldn't It Be Nice...? 
Important yes great no. 
NO NO NO. 
why pet sounds REALLY isn't the best album of all time 
Pet Sounds 
I wish I could like this more 
You must be joking..... 
Unusually strong for 1966 but less so out of context 
&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; surround mix basically 4.0 
it wasn't a certified million seller in part because of 
Influential and important? Sure. Great? Not so much. 
In the Eye of the Beholder 
Dated 
Mastering just OK 
Sorry America..... 
Groundbreaking = Yes!  Masterpiece = No! 
Concept? 
Essential Jazz Album for Your Music Library! 
Gorgeously tired 
MP3 album problem! 
Good but not the original Endless Summer. 
Very Good Beach Boys Pre-Pet Sounds Compilation Now In MLPS Format! 
very good CD but it has its weak points 
Bad remastering but Brilliant album 
The follow up to Endless Summer 
A good album but not my favorite 
Some great songs/Some safe for the supermarket 
Time and The Nick of Time 
Her big breakthrough 
Pompous Flatulence Abounds 
Over-rated album from the BRILLIANT Jethro Tull 
Somewhat Inconsistent 
The memory 
I need to explain 
The sound is duller-- 
Aqualung Still Treading Water (for me) 
STEREO? 
The Zombies Greatest Hits 
The Theme gets the 3 stars! 
Should have read the reviews before I scooped this one up 
Oh The Thin Line Between Big Band and Elevator Music... 
Not So Firm 
Could Be Better 
If you like Dr John its OK 
High quality commercial jazz fusion 
Poor Sound Quality 
Glorified Elevator Music 
Bad Shape Vinyl 
Light Years.... 
Has Some Worthwhile Moments and KILLER Bonus Tracks 
Behold Other Chick First 
A mixed bag.... 
Good Instrumental Defintion But Middle of the Road Melodies 
Nice acoustic guitar smooth jazz duo 
Good Fun 
A review of Spyro Gyra's Three Wishes. 
Thankfully not \smooth jazz\ but could be edgier at times 
Well done perhaps but rather too \smooth\ for my taste 
no wes 
Run from Your Stereo 
Okay 
Old skool Rippingtons 
This Was a Gift 
Man has she improved! 
I recant - Ms Krall is a real artist 
An almost good record marred by marketing desire 
lesser than the sum of its parts 
A little too slick not enough composition 
Okay CD 
Best contemporary Benson in a long time but... 
So-so 
A review of The Rippingtons's The Best Of The Rippingtons.

Just Doesn't Fit 
Not One of My Favorite AKUS Albums but Still Laudable 
This has flaws yet with a gem or two or three... 
Didn't Connect.

All have done much better work; buy their solo work instead 
Tracy and Irma great combo. 
In search of the lost Arkestra 
Average Raffi Average Christmas song

A  Combination of the Two 
Good and a half 
Dated Movie 
A Few Good Songs On This Album 
1+2=3.5 
Interesting but can't hold a candle to Jimi Hendrix 
For those who like to be yelled at. A hardcore classic!! 
Good value for the money I spent 
A little tedious 
Half Good 
Live Set (LIVE) - Michael W. Smith 
nice Christmas cd 
What's Missing? 
This is not a 5 star album 
All songs sound the same 
Enjoyable from beginning to end. 
Solid but not remastered for whatever reason. 
80's pop female singers ruled! 
For The Fledgling Flock Fan a Fine **First** Listen! 
Well if this is all a fan can find... 
Sorry to admit this-I didn't give this CD a decent chance! 
A solid collection of material 
Haircuts and Attitudes 
If music be the food of love play on! 
Essential 80's Rap Music (3 Stars) 
Boring...

Good Songs but not a full album to me. 
old school 
Good 
Not as good as \Samantha Fox\ but probably better than most anything else that she did 
Wounded Bird does it again--which is not a good thing. 
Hasn't Aged Well 
Huh? 
kind of disappointing 
20th Anniversary Remaster But No Elephant Stone 
KRS already made an album called Blueprint first........... 
Not one of his bests 
With some missing tracks this cd would be outstanding 
More Jazzy Rap 
Mix bag 
The first half is good... 
She co-wrote a few of her own here 
Not bad but not good 
Old School 
Grits from Kid Rock 
Definitely Worthwhile

Promising 
Seems to revolve around one single but still pretty good. 
Wow It's actually listenable.

are y'all sure that THIS ALBUM isn't their DEBUT???? 
An Evolutionary Step for Short Dogg

Another Decent CD but a bit weaker 
THIS CD IS NOTHING SPECIAL. 
Weak but not worthless 
Album \#10\ maybe my least favorite of his 
A dope album if you haven't heard the first three 
The Fall off begins................ 
The end of an era 
This CD is OK. 
I feel like I'm re-writing my Hanson review. 
A group for today but not for posterity 
This is ok 
good pop album 
Could be better... 
One side of the story 
O.K.ALBUM BUT NOT AS BAD AS THEIR 2ND ALBUM.. 
Rapper's Ball 
Tight CD 
ENTERTAINING

Two great tracks 
Touches of levity Compelling love songs Dazzling guitar 
Solid supplements 
The last album.... 
I want to like this I really do. 
Has its moments but is easily surpassed elsewhere 
watered down Toure 
Pleasant but FAR from compelling collaboration 
10% Tibbetts 90% Choying Drolma... 
Contractual obligation? 
I like the title song the best. 
Packaging? A Greeting Card? 
Solid if uneven effort from the Thompsons 
FINE VOCALS BUT ORDINARY SONGS FROM SANDY DENNY 
Continuing a Tradition of British Folk-Rock

The recording or the performance? 
Great Performance but not what it advertises...... 
5 out of 6

Perhaps the first rock opera! 
My Least Favorite Zappa Material 
Sublime Guitar Solo 
Flo & Eddie #2  Is Still Entertaining But One Of The Weakest FZ Albums!! 
Strange.............but good. 
An O.K. Album 
Billy Eddie several vegetables bad breath and child molestation? 
Great!  ...if you are a teenage boy 
I was at the concert. 
Farewell Flo & Eddie....You Won't Be Missed.....Enough Is Enough 
Is anyone else having trouble with the CD 
A bit overdeveloped 
3 stars and 1/2 is righter...another classic!! 
Three out of Five... 
classic songs - mediocre album 
Not A Classic 
Need to work on providing a quicker response time to customer inquiries 
okay 
Some good stuff ... 
Not as good as it's made out to be. 
3 stars and 1/2 is righter.. such a remarkable tour!! 
a weak effort with some quality moments 
BUY THE VINYL!! 
Amazing varied Zappa guitar textures. Great Bozzio drums. 
mwah... 
good and a half 
A classic masterpiece BUT 
Soft/Hard/Hard/Hard...But the soft is 25 minutes of an LP! 
Who is making those new brown clouds? 
Great Demo Disc but... 
Annoying vocal makes this inferior to original but true to Zappa's vision 
Ruined by the vocals 
Another good late 70s 
No it's not 
For Zappa completists only (which isn't a bad thing)... 
Is this Frank Zappa mucking around a few good tracks... 
The best and worst of Zappa... 
Shlockingly good to shockingly good 
not essential 
Are you hardcore? 
Good But Also Points Out The Crux Of The Biscuit 
Bitter self-indulgence with some exceptional tracks 
Some good stuff here 
Reaction to previous reviews 
Too specialized for entertainment purposes 
The Music Is MUST HAVE ZAPPA - but the item was not in the shape described 
Compelling crossroads 
Not for Zappa music and composition fans 
Contains Zappa's insufferable \hit song\ but also some more substantive music 
none of the above 
Love and hate 
Not as bad as it's reputation suggests. 
Some great songs to fill in a 'Worst of Zappa' album 
Not his best 
non-essential but fun 
Not one of Zappa's best but worth 9 dollars 
For most people not essential 
My first exposure 
Get The Vinyl--the CD version blows. 
Kind of Suprising that the quality was not really there 
Music great; recording awful. 
What kind of FZ fan are you? 
hmm... 
A classic? 
A Good Zappa Instrumental Album....part orchestra/part synclavier 
I *love* Zappa but this is not his best work 
Contains some good stuff despite the in-organic sound 
Good Zappa though not great... 
By Zappa's standards it's actually a 1 star album (2012 remaster review) 
Synclaviered Classical 
This  was  a  joke  really 
Who really gets this one? 
A curiosity 
Good and a half 
synthetic 
A rather lackluster live Zappa compilation album from the 1980s 
Difficult..... 
CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION... 
Can't Wrap My Brain Around This One... 
Very clever - but almost no soul 
for fans only 
Some good stuff but mostly forgettable.... 
good and a half 
One of Zappa's few mixed bags.... 
Typical 1988 Zappa...not necessarily a good thing 
Ignore the lyrics and you have a good album 
For completists only 
Eccentrock 
A flashback to the 1970-71 Mothers 
Zappa's 62nd release - get the other 61 FIRST

TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT PERFORMANCES 
You Can't Do That on Stage does it better

Tracks 1-9 3 stars...The rest is 5 stars 
OK but not as good as the others 
Mixed blessing 
Strictly Commercial party-record edition 
Overrated 
GOOD BUT ALSO SLEEP INDUCING 
I dunno... 
Barry's always worthwhile but not one of his best. 
Okay 
Delux Rancho Delux 
+3/4 -- Long-lost country-styled soundtrack 
Sadly fades from \Wowza!\ to \What-th--?\ in too little time. 
Never meant for everyone 
I know it should be all about the MUSIC but... 
Scary Monsters 
We are the goon squad... 
David Bowie Meet The 80's...... 
Sorry but I can't stand it! Oh well I couldn't... 
The only good album from Bowie's 80s period 
Best Bowie Album? I don't think so... 
GOOD STARTER BUT................. 
A Fitting Title

Too much touring and booze! 
Looking Back 
Moments of Brilliance Hampered by Dated Production 
Like sex and pizza even bad E.C. is still pretty good 
Poor Napoleon's Waterloo 
Ugh... 
Great Release But Not So Great Bonus Material 
Better than you remember it 
Not EC's best but has its moments 
One Classic but all worth hearing 
Nice try but this doesn't cut it for Costello 
OK for starters  but somewhat one-dimmensional 
An absurd concept... 
The Best? 
For die hard fans 
For the casual fan. 
The problem with Zappa's stuff... 
A one-sided look at Zappa's career

Sad album

Should be 1000 x better 
Very Nice EP 
Ironing out kinks 
Becoming beautiful
