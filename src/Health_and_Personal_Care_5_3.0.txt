Caveat emptor 
close shave 
Doesn't work well if you shave infrequently 
Over-priced Over-bladed 
great 
Works great 
Great shave but way too costly 
Good product to add to your Amazon purchase.  Knocked off stars because of Gillette's confusing product system. 
I like it because it is cheaper than the same brand at the store... 
Ugh 
Expensive but good 
Save your money. These blades are a rip off! 
Blades Good 
Great product 
Fantastic but not in my &#34;club&#34; anymore

a neutral review for this one 
I LIKE OTHER SUPPLEMENTS MORE 
Don't buy this in bulk. 
I would suggest buying the 6 foot hose instead

Won't get the really big stuff off. 
Better to get whole seed & grind it yourself 
Didn't like purchased for price though 
So far so good 
Only a slight improvement... 
Great for leg cramps 
Ok for stainless not great does streak

Hoping For it to Taste Better 
High protein yet bland flavor aftertaste and dry cakey texture 
A little bitter not very peanut buttery but 20g of protein in 80 cal is great 
Meh. Tastes like nothing much. 
Higher in protein than most competitors 
Taste Could be Better.

Only if you need sugar free and gluten free 
It tastes okay but not very peanut butter-ish 
Love 'em but not the calories. 
Too dense 
Decent tasting a bit dry 
Texture and taste a bit off 
Protein filled pipe dream

Jarrow Formulas Resveratrol Synergy 
Like this product but worried that it has less resveratol 
Not much Resveratrol in this formula 
contains little Resveratrol 
how to check for results of this supplement? 
Should Be Called \Synergy\ 
Good combination but dosages are low 
I'm no nutritional expert but 20 mg of Resveratrol seems low 
Placebo? 
Has some decent antioxidants but label is a bit misleading 
No Harm in Trying 
Poor Name Choice 
Pass - the dose is too low for me 
Not Much Resveratrol - Some Green Tea Grape Skin and Grape Seeds 
Great for my circulation 
No Side Effects small dose though of actual Resveratrol..

not much resveratrol for a resveratrol product 
Gotta Love Jarrow! 
Seems OK 
never tried before 
Heard the Raves 
Name not necessarily accurate

Takes getting used to 
Different Scents Had Different Scent Strengths 
Nice gift for certain people; opinions will vary WIDELY on the scents; Not for budget minded 
It's okay... 
Easy and pleasant but not really aromatherapy 
About average in the 'home fragrance' line 
Lacking fragrence life... 
Neat product but these particular fragrances are not what I expected 
Better for use in small rooms 
Nice gift item 
Great scents not very strong though.

Not strong enough 
A nice alternative to heavier scented products.

Simple needs a wireless headset 
Decent

Okay Considering it's Inexpensive 
They do work 
Ouch. 
Good fit. One sorry box. 
I was sent polyurethane powdered gloves 
Fine 
Don't see any better results than other variations on the theme 
Not the good strips . . .

Nice but overpriced 
The same as my regular (and less expensive) Venus!

not the closest shave 
not the best of their selection 
Actually my wife's review if you must know. 
Not bad; but shaving takes twice as long 
The New Gillette Venus Embrace Provides Longer Lasting Shaves 
Ok But Not Great 
Not going to be Embraced by me.... 
Too Smooth 
OK Not Great 
Manual Shaver 
Gillette Venus Embrace Razor - Great Razor; Holder Aweful 
A few good improvements...until next year's replacement. 
Good product 
Another fine (if slightly unneccesary) addition to the Gillette lineup 
Not Sure 
More Mortal than Goddess.... 
I miss my Sensor Excel for Women but... 
Lots of Tricks But So So Shave 
Prilosec is more effective 
great for heartburn relief 
Too Big and Bulky 
Feels fine while wearing it 
Works well expensive. 
Too stiff for my tender plantar fasciitis feet :( 
Not so effective but convenient 
Make sure your hands are dry. 
It worked 
Arrived on time not sure how well this product works 
Does what it is supposed to. 
No magic cure 
Okay but basically ben gay

not as good as shamwow but they do the trick 
They're OK. Not great 
shrinks after washing

Butt protecting cushion seems squishy 
Good for freezing fell apart in the microwave.

Would have been great. 
I made another mistake 
Could be better 
Blank expiration date 
Nice 
Good nasal spray 
Very Average 
Soothing but... 
Minty! 
Thought it was 400 mg per capsule 
Probably Not a Weight Loss Magic Bullet 
Works for a while? 
Some change in weight 
Okay I think... 
400 mg of green coffee extract per serving to keep you energized 
Unsure as to how it works 
tastes okay but what is the hype? 
What does it do? 
Doesn't seem to work for me 
Quality product but had no impact on my hunger 
Good concept; results uncertain 
We will see 
Gave Me The Jitters.... 
Less Than Phenomenal 
It seems green coffee beans means less dreams 
No Quick Results 
Amazing results - for the first two weeks ... 
Gives a slight boost 
Too Early to Tell... (but Intriguing Enough to Keep Trying...) 
Didn't Work For Me 
Didn't really do anything for me 
No Difference 
No conclusive results 
Not for weight loss 
Hard to Say if it Has Any Effects or Not

Keeps me awake at night... 
Mixed Review 
Seems to work 
Far as I Can Tell This Will Be a Good Product 
Nothing happened 
Helpful but unsteady 
it's the taste 
Good formula a little too much sugar for my taste 
Great company... 
Works well on very minor pain 
Really About Average So Far 
Repeat Review 
Not quite up to par 
Compare cost to benefit 
OK pain relief 
Works for minor aches and pains but not major ones 
Moderate Pain Relief 
Not for my tendonitis 
Good but not great only short term pain relief 
Not a miracle but helps soften the pain 
Temporary relief 
synthetic 
Hard as heck to swallow
