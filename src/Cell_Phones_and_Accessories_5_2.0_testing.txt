Need to see how it goes 
Lack of quality control. 
Not so good. Not what I expected 
Alright Product ... 
Why are there so many 5 star reviews the only review ever given?

Most difficult application!

Bubbles 
Screen Protects aren't very good 
Not that good 
sturdy product but... 
Wouldn't recommend 
Would not purchase! 
Thick 
Would be a fine headset if it would stay connected 
If you don't care about style 
Cheesy only good for a back-up or temporary use 
White didn't stay white long. 
Starts out good then stains...Booo! 
not a good fit on iphone 5s 
Nice and light but makes the phone hard to use

Belkin missed the mark in this one 
Not so orange 
Camera cut out is too large 
Wife did not care for the way it fit over the phone. 
No grip 
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWN BUT NICE CASE 
Don't waste your time or money 
Use for Color Not Protection 
No value for money 
DesIGn is more like jelly beans and looks like cheap plastic. See my pic above. 
Not as expected 
Rubbery Grip 
no 
Cheap and you should buy something else... 
Big problem with scuffing on the back cover 
Nice Features Not So Nice Features 
Looks ok but difficult to put on scratches and doesn't feel good in your hand 
Traps dust like crazy 
Discolored quickly (WHITE Case) 
Received and sent back for refund the same day 
Good design but does not works with the same brand dock 
Great Idea Poor Execution

Nope...look elsewhere.. 
Too Thick and Hard to Use Buttons; Go With Belkin Grip Candy Instead

Not sleek and scratches too easily. 
Would have given it 5 stars but it doesn't fit the adapter and some headphone cables

Not a Fan of this Case 
Does not fit completely 
Doesn't fit iPhone 5 properly to be sweat-proof or moisture-proof 
Cheap Look and Feel 
Sides became separated after just a few days - returning it 
Not grippy! 
BUYER WARNING! 
Get what you pay for 
Kind of inconsistent on where it works. 
Works great with some devices 
Okay I guess 
May be all 3 in pkg i received are faulty.

Sound is not worthy of the price. 
Not recommended.

Fell apart :-( 
Too Bulky 
Quite Bulky 
Scratched on arrival

Honestly... 
Not worth it 
Nothing special 
Does not align with the shape of the device 
Worked fine for month

Love OtterBox Products but this one is questionable.... 
OtterBox Commuter Series for iPhone 5 - Frustration-Free Packaging... 
Not a fan of the Commuter 
Very slippery. Bottom hinges don't like to stay in place. 
Decent Case. Breaks a lot more than the old Commuter Case 
NO THANK 
what's the point 
Cute but Dirty 
Over rated 
Shop around 
case does not hold up to its quality 
Not worth my money 
Deformed Body 
I wanted to love it 
You've got ONE shot... 
I thought it was a must-buy...I was wrong 
Larger than Phone 
Service is great idea is cool - original and it's replacement did not work. 
love the kick stand 
Ehhh... 
Got the wrong colors. Twice. 
Not a very good replacement 
Screen has Blue hue to it and is not as sharp 
Does not with all iPad versions 
Don't Buy unless you have to 
Good sound poor fit 
The old ones fit so much better! 
not back-compatible; loose in the ears (fall out); quality sound is at par no better. 
Apple only no matter what other phone you have. 
Genuine Original??? 
Cheap 
You can get twice the quality for half the price elsewhere 
they gave me a refund and I would have gave them an excellent review if it wasn't for the fact that one ... 
replica 
Not authentic Apple EarPods 
Materials are ok but sloppily constructed. 
cute but... 
Don't get this for your Note 3 get better quality. 
Does NOT protect screen. Feels cheap. 
It is grippy but the \fake carbon fibre\ is tacky and it becomes brittle 
You get what you pay for! 
Still not even close to Samsung Galaxy S2 Price is way too High! 
It's a great phone but not worth upgrading from 4S 
Cute but not very protective 
Ugly cheap looking case. Yeah it is cheap but there are other better options. 
ALREADY RIPPED!! 
Updated review 
Look elsewhere 
Wow!  Size really does matter... 
No cover/protection for power port 
not woth the time 
BUYER BEWARE 
TOO CHEAP 
Nice Cover but not really a protection if phone is dropped 
Cheap 
comment rating 
Really depends on your use 
Not the Quality Expected from Incipio 
Thoroughly disappointed with this case. 
The concept is nice but the product not so much 
Plastic casing not what I expected 
Utterly useless storage compartment. 
Unsure 
not that great 
Did not like case 
Just not my cup of tea 
Color not as depicted 
Good NOT Great Protection and Gets too Dirty 
Incipio's business model is very temporary satisfaction matched with advertising. 
Rubber stretches easily 
Didn't last long 
Buttons Do Not Work Well 
Color is NOTHING as described 
cracked after 6 weeks 
comment 
Power button issues 
Hated It 
Perfect Case except one big flaw 
not as nice as iPhone 4 model 
Teal green is NOT TEAL! 
You can't press the power button 
Paint came off after one month 
Better products out there. 
flimsy kickstand wouldn't stay on wood table returned it 
Kind of Ugly with Flimsy Kickstand 
I loved it at first after a few months - not so much. 
Loose conections. 
Belt clip broke first day 
Ok Case. Holster unusable. 
Bad case/clip 
Not for me 
Not good quality 
Not the Case for Me 
Scratched with no pressure 
not bad but 
Not much protection. 
think twice before you buy 
Nice case but doesn't fit right. 
Not The Premium Hard Case I Expected 
A disappointment 
Would not buy. Ended up buying another case 
for the price it's ok 
SLIPPERY! 
Ok. Not great. 
Hmmmmm 
Not all that great 
Won't protect 
Avoid 
Too slippery too heavy too snug

Phone Case 
didn't work with my UNU iphone5 battery case 
Not for iPhone 4 and lifeproof cas 
sorry didnt like it 
You'll have to deal with Samsung's horrible customer service 
Not as nice as the iOttie smart tap 
Do Not buy the Flex 2 buy the One Touch 
Does not remain stuck to a perfectly flat dash 
Sorry can't share the enthusiasm for this product. 
iOttie Easy Flex2 was only okay... 
Too Sticky to Remove Easily 
Decent product but NOT for extended batteries or cases! 
It was fine in the beginning... 
Couldn't stand the test of time... 
I wish it had worked better 
Somewhat loose fit 
Returned 
Not a good value. 
Love the color! 
Good idea not a great product. 
Quantity over Quality 
White rubber on this case is a stain magnet 
While A Good Concept There Are Better Options Available 
It was a gift 
Not the Slider case of yore. 
Good idea bad execution 
Was great for two days and then my phone cracked 
Cheaply made 
A Generic Case Design 
Not so good 
Incorrectly titled iphone5 case 
great case 
Didn't fit my 5s well compared to several other cases. 
Doesnt fit snug 
eh.. 
I don't like the texture 
Ballistics are good. This model/type is not. 
too thin to really protect imho 
Wouldnt buy this again 
not so happy about it. 
Defective Screen Protector 
Would be decent -- if a 6 year old hadn't done the cutouts 
UPDATE: After 2 Months Was Too Dirty Would Not Clean - Had to Throw Away 
Ridiculously difficult to apply 
Don't like how this affects viewing quality ridiculously difficult to apply 
Anti-Glare screen protectors aren't crystal clear 
Not even close to as good as the older HBS-700 
Not for the long unruly hair among us or scarves 
Range sucks 
Disappointing for users of a previous model 
Not for Everyone 
Item returned 
Wanted to like them but sorry 
A disappointment 
LG says designed for bluetooth 3 or below - doesn't work well with google note 2 
Too cheaply constructed doesn't last 
Just got this doesn't seem right. 
I like but doesnt look new 
GREAT sound and comfort but a bad design flaw 
Bluetooth ear buds--NOT a headset. 
Unreliable bluetooth great sound when it worked. 
Pause does not work with iPhone 4S 
it's ok 
Very disappointed 
Disappointed 
Poor build quality and ergonomics 
Only Good for 6 Months 
Good ear buds - if they last. 
I was not happy with this device. 
Was an OK Product Until Something Better Came On The Market 
Two Stars 
Its ok... with some issues 
Better sound than HBS-700 but sucky at holding connection 
Connection issues 
TOO MUCH HYPE 
Privacy vs. Screen Quality? Not worth the trade-off! 
Not even a month later and it is covered in scratches 
Fits well but provides little privacy 
Good for portrait-orientation privacy but with serious caveats 
Two Stars 
Great Look Minimalist Protection 
Does the job but has something missing in the description 
Adapter for iPhone 5 
Only works for charging not docks or accessories 
Works for Hyundai vehicles but the design is poor 
High Price Does Not Ensure Compatbility 
it doesn't work with a case 
Not what I expected. 
Didnt work 
Crappy Design 
SEIDIO has poor quality control 
nice matte finish just didn't fit quite right 
Looks Good-Little protection 
Quality not very good 
Buttons are not accessible 
Get what you paid for 
Not a Samsung Note II Replacement Pen 
There are better options 
Wouldnt recommed this one 
This piece of garbage... 
A little off 
You Get What You Pay For! 
screen protector 
Eh 
Not what I expected 
Could still see everything 
Careful the color is not a true red - appears 80's electro-pink/red. 
Was SWEET; now: Don't TRY to take OFF! 
White gets dirty fast and can't be cleaned.  Flimsy bottom 
Is just ok... 
Black Amazon charge cord won't fit 
Silicone Great Poly not so much. 
Didn't fit properly! 
Cheap and wont last 
Lacking A Little 
Where's My Home Button and Why Is There So Much Lint? 
Not For Me 
Trade off protection vs clear view. This Iphone 5 screen protector is anti smudge but distorts the view. 
Textured not clearworks to prevent smudges 
Disappointed 
Questionably worth the money 
Too small for screen 
Not good for HTC One sv with case 
Very Flimsy case 
Terrible Fit 
I still had to use scissors after using this cutter 
Great speaker but missing USB charging. 
Fits but... 
Gets discolored and does not fit cable 
doesn't worth it prefer buying a $3 ebay one! 
Not a quality product 
Failed after a weekend of use 
Returned and got a 4 dollar case from an ebay chinese manufacturer that is similar but better than this! 
Complicated on the Bubble free promise 
Very Rubbery 
Not as stated 
Does not fit my well 
Good case....just not for me. 
the case for the 4 was better 
Seemed great but cracked open after a few week 
A so-so case 
Damaged when I got it 
Terrible 
Loose 
Does it's job kind of. 
Too slippery for me 
very tight with my iphone case i do not trust it very tight case 
Good for a bit 
Cheaply made 
Cheap and unfinished 
I stopped using it. 
Two Stars 
Sub Par 
Decent Film Covering but... 
Protects but scratches easy 
quality not great 
Not premium at all just regular clear screen protectors. 
Mediocre 
Good idea but cheap feel 
Broken 
Defective after 5 months 
Back covers not worth it. 
Ok 
Works for the money you pay 
:(((( 
cheap and not good. 
**UPDATED*** crap

Cons outweigh pros. I wouldn't recommend this. 
Arm Strap is Too Big 
Hard to get phone in and out 
I wouldn't recommend this armband... 
Too tight

Easy to apply matte finish 
Works but not a good fit 
Worse than the others that I had before this one...

Too dark to see the phone through 
Just tint not privacy

Not a sonic upgrade from the 730 
It is Over Priced

Emergency use only

The hard plastic cover is extremely hard to remove. 
You have to be an expert at placing screen protectors

Not for me. Much too slippery. 
Look Elsewhere

Does its job but.. 
It's a darn shame these dont last longer.

Kind of inconsistent on where it works.

Love OtterBox Products but this one is questionable.... 
OtterBox Commuter Series for iPhone 5 - Frustration-Free Packaging... 
Not a fan of the Commuter 
Very slippery. Bottom hinges don't like to stay in place. 
Decent Case. Breaks a lot more than the old Commuter Case 
NO THANK 
what's the point 
Cute but Dirty 
Over rated 
Shop around 
case does not hold up to its quality 
Not worth my money 
Deformed Body 
I wanted to love it 
You've got ONE shot... 
I thought it was a must-buy...I was wrong 
Larger than Phone 
Service is great idea is cool - original and it's replacement did not work. 
love the kick stand 
Ehhh... 
Got the wrong colors. Twice. 
Not a very good replacement 
Screen has Blue hue to it and is not as sharp 
Does not with all iPad versions 
Don't Buy unless you have to 
Good sound poor fit 
The old ones fit so much better! 
not back-compatible; loose in the ears (fall out); quality sound is at par no better. 
Apple only no matter what other phone you have. 
Genuine Original??? 
Cheap 
You can get twice the quality for half the price elsewhere 
they gave me a refund and I would have gave them an excellent review if it wasn't for the fact that one ... 
replica 
Not authentic Apple EarPods 
Materials are ok but sloppily constructed. 
cute but... 
Don't get this for your Note 3 get better quality. 
Does NOT protect screen. Feels cheap. 
It is grippy but the \fake carbon fibre\ is tacky and it becomes brittle 
You get what you pay for! 
Still not even close to Samsung Galaxy S2 Price is way too High! 
It's a great phone but not worth upgrading from 4S 
Cute but not very protective 
Ugly cheap looking case. Yeah it is cheap but there are other better options. 
ALREADY RIPPED!! 
Updated review 
Look elsewhere 
Wow!  Size really does matter... 
No cover/protection for power port

Nice Cover but not really a protection if phone is dropped 
Cheap 
comment rating 
Really depends on your use 
Not the Quality Expected from Incipio 
Thoroughly disappointed with this case. 
The concept is nice but the product not so much 
Plastic casing not what I expected 
Utterly useless storage compartment. 
Unsure 
not that great 
Did not like case 
Just not my cup of tea 
Color not as depicted 
Good NOT Great Protection and Gets too Dirty 
Incipio's business model is very temporary satisfaction matched with advertising. 
Rubber stretches easily 
Didn't last long 
Buttons Do Not Work Well 
Color is NOTHING as described 
cracked after 6 weeks 
comment 
Power button issues 
Hated It 
Perfect Case except one big flaw 
not as nice as iPhone 4 model 
Teal green is NOT TEAL! 
You can't press the power button 
Paint came off after one month 
Better products out there. 
flimsy kickstand wouldn't stay on wood table returned it 
Kind of Ugly with Flimsy Kickstand 
I loved it at first after a few months - not so much. 
Loose conections. 
Belt clip broke first day 
Ok Case. Holster unusable. 
Bad case/clip 
Not for me 
Not good quality 
Not the Case for Me 
Scratched with no pressure 
not bad but 
Not much protection. 
think twice before you buy 
Nice case but doesn't fit right. 
Not The Premium Hard Case I Expected 
A disappointment 
Would not buy. Ended up buying another case 
for the price it's ok 
SLIPPERY! 
Ok. Not great. 
Hmmmmm 
Not all that great 
Won't protect 
Avoid 
Too slippery too heavy too snug 
Nothing Great...

Phone Case 
didn't work with my UNU iphone5 battery case 
Not for iPhone 4 and lifeproof cas 
sorry didnt like it 
You'll have to deal with Samsung's horrible customer service 
Not as nice as the iOttie smart tap 
Do Not buy the Flex 2 buy the One Touch 
Does not remain stuck to a perfectly flat dash 
Sorry can't share the enthusiasm for this product. 
iOttie Easy Flex2 was only okay... 
Too Sticky to Remove Easily 
Decent product but NOT for extended batteries or cases! 
It was fine in the beginning... 
Couldn't stand the test of time... 
I wish it had worked better 
Somewhat loose fit 
Returned 
Not a good value. 
Love the color! 
Good idea not a great product. 
Quantity over Quality 
White rubber on this case is a stain magnet 
While A Good Concept There Are Better Options Available 
It was a gift 
Not the Slider case of yore. 
Good idea bad execution 
Was great for two days and then my phone cracked 
Cheaply made 
A Generic Case Design 
Not so good 
Incorrectly titled iphone5 case 
great case 
Didn't fit my 5s well compared to several other cases. 
Doesnt fit snug 
eh.. 
I don't like the texture 
Ballistics are good. This model/type is not. 
too thin to really protect imho 
Wouldnt buy this again 
not so happy about it. 
Defective Screen Protector 
Would be decent -- if a 6 year old hadn't done the cutouts 
UPDATE: After 2 Months Was Too Dirty Would Not Clean - Had to Throw Away 
Ridiculously difficult to apply 
Don't like how this affects viewing quality ridiculously difficult to apply 
Anti-Glare screen protectors aren't crystal clear 
Not even close to as good as the older HBS-700 
Not for the long unruly hair among us or scarves 
Range sucks 
Disappointing for users of a previous model 
Not for Everyone 
Item returned 
Wanted to like them but sorry 
A disappointment

Too cheaply constructed doesn't last

Two Stars 
Its ok... with some issues 
Better sound than HBS-700 but sucky at holding connection 
Connection issues

Not a sonic upgrade from the 730 
It is Over Priced

Be careful when ordering this product. 
Good idea but not very practical unless you have lots of CR123A batteries (or very low power devices) 
Not recommended. 
Why not make this rechargeable? 
Didn't work for me 
Emergency use only 
Okay in a Pinch

Bulky and awkward 
I don't like this. 
I was hoping for better. 
Case is nice but so far the smart functions have been hit or miss 
Too heavy and bulky 
The hard plastic cover is extremely hard to remove. 
You have to be an expert at placing screen protectors 
Installation issues which should be revised. 
Not for me. Much too slippery. 
Look Elsewhere

Not too durable. 
Does its job but.. 
It's a darn shame these dont last longer.

Great sound quality uncomfortable to wear. 
would be OK if I could stand wearing in-ear earbuds

Just doesn't fit and a couple of other complaints 
Needs improvement 
Just did not work for me.... 
Poor support for a lack luster product
