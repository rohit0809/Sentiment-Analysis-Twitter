Excellent RPG - complex enough to keep one entertained 
A nice refreshing break from hack and slash RPG's. 
Different game lots of fun

TR Chronicles 
Fun but you could get boared from it. 
Classic Kid's game 
Imagination comes to life 
Powerful but clunky 
Almost everything you could want 
Classic Still 
Once you learn exactly how everything fits together it's possible to make good games
