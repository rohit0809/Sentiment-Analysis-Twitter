Not up to the good mobster films 
Not Entirely Historically Accurate 
wouldnt we all have rather seen a movie about moe green? 
Average At Best 
visionary gangster 
Blu-ray: Not the 3-hour version not many special features and simply a film that is known greatly for its first five minutes.

Dated 
My opinion of this film. 
Crazy 56K action! 
Just a little dated 
A very average thriller 
Slow moving but Sandra Bullock looks hot using 90s technology! 
Reasonably Entertaining. Taps Into Real Fears of the Net. But a Bit Flat. 
The Lurking Fear 
Identity Crisis 
That's right we bad ... 
A good if uneven film 
Great movie potential...falls apart after one hour! 
Wilder + Pryor = Big Laughs

Good  but not good anouph . 
Interesting thought experiment. 
It gets off to a stellar start and then flatlines...
