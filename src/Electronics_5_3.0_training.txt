This is the oem charger you get with the nook hd+ 
$45 for a power cord? Good luck with that. 
Great for the price. 
for 25&#34; monitor it worked well 
Works but I don't trust it 
A little big for 24&#34; TV's 
Bought to mount 46\ LCD 
Didn't fit as I expected 
Much heavier than I expected 
Somewhat weak 
Too Heavy and Poor weld quality 
It's OK

It Works But Could Be Better 
Wall Mount

Decent Little Reader Poor Tablet 
Ok For What It Is 
Not for senior citizens 
It's a entry-level tablet for $250 
Initially liked but now.... 
Know What You're Buying 
A nice reader but don't expect tablet capabilities 
Cheap way to browse web and run android apps on a fast beautiful display 
Meh - Some buyer's remorse 
Good Hardware - terrible OS and App availability 
Could be better 
This Nook is Good but the new Nook Simple Touch is WAY Better 
Why Would You Want To Do That? 
Great device but why not ship it to Canada? 
PDF Issues 
certified refurbished nook color 
Good product.  HORRIBLE company. 
archos would be better 
One deal breaker 
Useless for internet 
Great color still not an iPad not for long trips without AC 
Good for casual reading. Not better than a Kindle as a true ereader device 
There's not much point in buying this 
It's passable once jail broken

Great device when it works 
A Plea on behalf of the Visually Impaired 
A Little Nook e

Kindle lover jumps ship for a few hours 
E-READERS ARE FOR NOVEL READERS ONLY?? 
Just an honest review 
Glitchy battery does not last long :( 
Dead in the water! 
A bit buggy 
is nice 
Good for what it can do. 
Not quite a Moleskine 
Fair at Best 
died just after warranty 
A Few Serious Problems 
It's okay and easy to use but feels a bit flimsy although I ... 
Just Okay 
BEWARE  _ This is not a CD writer/burner 
Unstable and exceed the Volt rating after charge... 
Okay in our High Output LED Flashlight but not Great 
Not a bad single-cell charger 
Okay for iPods unnecessary for iPhone 
Works fine 
wrond item 
Mini microphone 
Good for what it is 
Good but nothing special 
Connects my Canon camera to HDTVs. Could not connect to HDMI switch. 
10ft cable adaptation. 
Definitely not a Canon brand cable 
Good - But Won't Play High Bitrate Content Most 3D 
Not a Bad Little Charger 
Charger works great but Garmin stays in USP conneted mode. 
Does the job form factor is impractically small 
Adequate Adapter 
Works 
Didn't work for me but would probably work elsewhere. 
Did the Job 
Didn't work for me- but it works for many CD players 
okay 
Doubtful as to it's efficacy. 
Foldable but didn't last long 
I am not sure if it cleaned 
Clean the tape deck or it will be washed up fast! 
Probably good tape but not for my use. 
Dinosaurs do exist 
Hard to say...

Excellent Radio - Poor Clock 
Not what I'd hoped for. 
Ouch- but they sound nice 
Great product but fragile 
Good but BEWARE the streaks

Keeps cords organized but design is missing key feature 
They're alright 
colorful 
Cable ties 
Easy to use 
Paying for a brand name 
OK 
Where the heck did I put that original cord?

Belkin 7-ft RJ45 CAT 5E ethernet cable: Belkin doesn't understand -- don't kink electronic cables! 
Bellin Cat 5 patch Cable 
It works as Expected 
doesnt seem to fit 
Good cable. Not Dark gray like in picture. 
Slightly damaged but working perfectly 
Not bad for the price but not satisfying in the long haul. 
Disappointing 
Not so small to consider on a Palm Vx 
Won't fit in Palm Cradle 
Amazing.  It's great when obsolete technology saves the day! 
There are better Zip drives out there 
Handsome Case 
Lock and secure 
Good protection comes with a trade off 
Overpriced But Necessary 
These batteries are 1200 mAH 
Epoxy didn't bond well 
Poor build-quality but otherwise it does what it should 
Not shock resistant 
Great style but an important flaw 
I like the Palm IIIe 
Efficient Organizer; but low on features and memory 
This isn't glossy or semi-gloss 
So so 
Another Ersatz Insert Replacement - But Good for Custom CD's / Gifts 
Complicated Assembly 
Why not pay less for something that is going to &quot;just&quot; work? 
OK if your camera fits 
Solid unit...with a catch 
Bathtub 
Ok for the price and basic functions 
Good binoculars if you're not too close 
Bino's 
They're OK 
Not bad but could be better 
Lack of narrow interpupillary range could be a problem - think about Bushnell H2O's instead 
Install disk fail however manual install works great 
Worth the price with multiple rebates 
Good sound Weak quality Poor support 
Price is right and it works 
$50? Really? 
Nice Headset 
Not good for Motorcycles 
Come in Major Tom

Good but not great 
&quot;Hard&quot; tip -- Palm III stylus runs smoother 
Very useful for some tasks 
Still Going 
Not a smart charger but it has its uses and it is cheap. 
Good for the Price but Understand it ain't Smart 
Get the USB cradle instead...

Works Well...but at a price! 
Too pricey 
Okay for what it is -- but be sure to not underestimate your needs 
Flimsy but cheap

I think it is OK 
Good sound metal rusts... 
Not as good as KOSS Sparkplug 
hurt my ears 
Sound is good cables are horrid. 
Good Sound Poor Fit 
Excellent Isolation Terrible Cord 
For Big ears 
Like the Koss \Spark Plug\ better 
Nice idea could be better implimented. 
OK 
could not get plugs to fit 
Why you expect HIFI sound from $12 headphones? 
Great fit in the ear 
Stay away. Quality has declined. 
I dont like 
Good headphones wish they made a tougher version 
Three Stars 
does the job 
Decent for slightly controlling volume 
short working lifespan 
Works OK but the leads are way too long 
Handy item 
Hey it works. 
Works for a while but the only thing like it for non-iPhone products 
Average 
It loses two stars for how it crackled and had a poor connection almost as soon as I got it in ... 
it works the tiny volume control wheel  is a little difficult to turn 
Looks cheap. 
Functional but somewhat flawed 
Great till it stops working 
Decent Product 
Nice to have 
Lasted a while 
Works but cheap construction 
Koss VC20 Volume control... 
Meh... 
Snap Crackle Pop 
Great Product but wire length needs to be shortened

Not Impressed At All 
Good product but beware long term durability 
Good sound poor construction 
Not living up to the hype 
Okay.  Not spectacular. 
Good quality but very it's very large 
Sounds good but it is made of cheap plastic that breaks often 
These are adequate with faulty construction. 
R-80 could be so much more with a little work 
Hey it's $16 
Good but there are much better headphones in this price range. 
Not Bad But Underwhelming 
Ok sound poor fit on a smallish ladyhead 
They Are Ok 
Solid performer with early durability problems

I like it. 
Not very durable

Too quiet for their intended use 
A bit uncomfortable but OK sound quality loud 
Average Headphones 
Great on sound... but not great on the ears 
Sounds good but may not be what you want 
Cheap Closed Headphones 
Good headphones uncomfortable wearing for extended periods 
No the Sony MDR-V600 does not compare to the Sony MDR7506 model 
Sony MDR-V600 does not equal MDR-V6 
Good comfort sound -- falls apart later 
Decent sound but the new cord is too thin. 
Great Entry Level Fir the Money / But 
WHOA! Definitely NOT close to the MDR-7506 or MDR-V6!! 
OK for the price and I like the design and fit so I keep buying them 
Good replacement not much else. 
Broke before 6 months 
Will NOT work with iPhone 4 
works well but the connector eventually wears out 
Expected more for the price 
Plantronics Mobile Convertible Headset M 175C 
Disappointingly flat sterile lifeless :( 
Mid-range lacking; not comfortable for long time wearing. 
highly overrated 
Major issues with the cord. 
Nice Headphones but Lacking in Deep Bass 
Disappointed... 
Harsh For My Ears Maybe Not For Others 
hard to wear 
Avid Listener= Journeyman Audiophile 
Not for enjoyment listening 
Great sound ok comfort 
Not as comfortable as as the headphones that Sony formerly made 
Sony MDR-V6 -- Good but not as good as the 7506 
Great sound/crappy earpads 
Great headphones 
Descent sound for the price 
sorry to say I'm returning them 
Not that great! 
Too accurate not enough bass 
Pretty Good 
They are OK but don't last long. 
Where is the Bass? 
Breaks easy 
Beware of the extra expenses! 
Best thing since Sony CFS-W455 
Very weak capacity for full screen 
Good cable 
USB cables 
cheap enough not to worry about 
DID NOT LAST LONG 
USB 1.1 speeds ONLY 
Worked for a while 
Dated but good 
Good Radio 
Smaller than DT200V but less performance

A bit more than I needed 
OK flawed software 
Are you feeling lucky? 
Works 
Senor is suitable for the location where it is used 
Not much tape 
Light exposure turns the white labels yellow/brown 
Its label tape 
Replay on track but still has glitches 
READ THIS before you buy and SAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE! 
Great Idea Still Needs Work. 
too large 
linksys etherfast 10/100 auto-sensing hub 
ROUTER NEEDED 
different from the picture 
Outdated technology 
These are great... For the price. 
nice network adapter 
Oudated Technology. No Need to Buy it New. 
What's the next step? 
Quite a device - 20 years ago 
Excellent product but .... 
Wipes information when battery dies 
Holds a lot but.... 
Good for reducing the shelf space of your CDs and DVDs 
CD Album overpriced about 1000 percent 
A real world comparison 
Not all it is cracked up to be. 
used look ugly but working 
Good Feature Set But Easy To Break 
connnected 
Good Cable! 
Very Tight Connector will damage your equipment 
Good sounding cable but cheaply made connectors 
Great Cable! 
Optical is optical 
No complaints 
It is what it is... 
A bit dissapointing 
Just a standard powerstrip 
Does the job but would prefer the plugs to run the other way. 
Not so perfect 
Works Well long life. 
jury's still out 
Works okay; don't use the coax cable connector 
Provides plenty of connections but it is a bit bulky. 
Surge Protection and Power Noise Reduction 
What's your budget? 
Make no different with the two Dollars Splitter 
Probably overpriced; promised benefits are illusory if you have digital cable 
Monster splitter 
Problems? 
Problematic 
Once great now forget it. 
You May Not See Your Rebate 
Good value but watch out for compatibility 
SLOW NOW 
~ Wrong Tapes ~

Buy the next model up

Average But Suitable for Kids 
Don't expect the world 
Acceptable 
These are worth what you pay.

POOR RECEPTION ON BEACH 
Inexpensive But Bad AM 
Pocket AM/FM RADIO FROM PANASONIC 
probably a better one out there 
well constructed radio with great reception 
So-so little radio at great price 
Power Outages 
not as good as the sony s10mk2 directional static 
Wish I had looked more carefully... 
Did not have an erase head -- so adds parts over instead of replacing them. 
Doesn't  have features I want/need 
Good and decent but not for everything 
Oi 
Not a comfortable fit at all.  Sound is clear but quite weak compared to the JVC HAS160 
Good value for cheap headphones 
Good bargain but low quality 
OK 
For the kids 
Nice headset great price! 
Great for kids not for audiophiles 
Not as good as Sony

Not GREAT...But they will do in a pinch... 
Works well; uncomfortable; easily broken 
Adequate Headphones Get What You Pay For 
Jack doesn't fit with certain iPhone cases. 
Uncomfortable 
Rather tight 
Low Priced did the job and didn't last long 
They're $4 
Too basic 
Panasonic headphones 
Worth the low price but not a dime more. 
earphones 
Lightweight Panasonic headphones 
for $4.50 you can't get a better headphone than this but uncomfortable to wear. 
The price is good 
You get what you pay for - a good thing for the right price. 
Good cheapys. 
fine 
You get what you pay for 
Sound is nice but design is poor 
Super cheap and lightweight 
worth the low price; sound fine; not very comfortable 
If your search was \folding headphones\ in electronics relevance keep looking!  These DO NOT FOLD! 
Fits nice on the head 
ok 
A fair card 
They're OK 
You can't go wrong with Bushnell 
a little heavy 
The lens covers are loose and never stay in place! 
NOT SO INTUITIVE CAMERA WITH A BATTERY FETISH 
Pocket PCs and Palms Too Big 
Not for the faint-hearted..... 
A few things to consider vs. Palm IIIxe

A joy to use but a bit delicate for the task at hand 
Very good but... I ended up selling it! 
Not as nice as the Palm

Ok to use for fun 
Fun toy but... 
Quirkey but fun 
This is a real tiny battery 
Lithium Photo Battery 
Questionable 
Good 
Bulk packaging 
Good for some but not for me. 
A little tight but the leather smells good 
Excellent product once installed. 
Great Camera when it Decides to Work 
great quirky confusing 
Lens holds a special place in my heart 
Canon's EF 35-80mm f/4-5.6 III... 
Not really worth the money unless... 
Is this lens as bad as some people say it is? 
Can do without it 
get something else if you can 
Canon EF 75-300mm 
good quality missing and important feature 
You get what you pay for but that's not such a horrible thing. 
Entry level telephoto lens 
Nice Lens... 
t&eacute;rmino medio 
The Canon EF 75-300MM zoom lens 
not bad but clearly entry-level 
It' Ok 
EF 75-300mm F4-5.6 
Ok for the money but there are better options... 
Should have kept saving $$ 
Its a good starter lens 
Good for the price 
Good average telephoto zoom. 
move up one more small notch 
Slow lense 
it's ok 
useless without a tripod 
Meh (or in more technical terms cheap lens soft focus slow) 
Pay for cheap get cheap... 
A nice thrifty choice. 
Pretty slow. 
great value but you will desire more shortly 
Depends on your expertise and budget. 
Good Price - Fair Optics - Limited Performance 
Could be better 
Alright for the price 
Great for the price 
unsteady hand be aware 
Long Focal Length on the Cheap 
A good lens when limits are understood 
Not good for Aviation photos but might be ok for portraits 
Better options exist 
380ex is great as a fill flash 
Using 380EX with my Rebel XTi 
Missing Common Sense Parts 
The Eye Cups are TERRIBLE.... 
Canon EF80-200mm f4.5-5.6 II 
Sima Lens Pen not exactly what I expected 
Can't tell yet I guess. 
it works but you better be close 
Ok. 
40 feet maybe not 4 miles 
Good as long as it works 
Now what did I do with this camera 
Brother P-Touch Tape can be cranky 
Not very crisp... 
Nice flash warranty service a bit of a pain... 
The best price and performance for the money 
not packaged as I expected 
It worked 
Bad roll encountered 
Ok average or slightly below average photos 
USE THIS CHEAP CAMERA ON THE BEACH & IN WATER 
Pale washed out colors 
OK underwater shots but are very grainy 
decent all around temporary camera 
Worked well but when you factor in cost of processing might not be worth it 
Disappointing Picture Quality 
You get what you pay for 
OK if you only need to carry this camera. 
OK bag for camera with lens 
Ok but oversized 
Broke at 6 months. Service Email Box Full. 
Not  par with otrher case logic products 
Does the job but kind of a pain 
Could be better 
OK if you are not going to be taking the ties on and off 
Not quite what i expected. 
Equipment Tag 
Does not fit any of my cases 
Good performance at a decent price...not the best if you travel a lot. 
'Toy' factor not quite worth the price of admission. 
Good idea imperfectly executed 
Lie about 1 Mega Pixel photos 
Allright 
Get the Case Logic CPS50 
Great for the price 
Read Product Description and You will Know 
functional but a bad design 
No Microphone Volume? 
Nice camera but falls short on convenience 
Good but got some bugs 
average device for an above average price 
Cannot expect much - 1st generation product 
Eh... does the job but... 
Works ok with some quirks 
Decent Trackball Mouse with a Few Drawbacks 
Different strokes 
Logitech Got It Backwards 
Not Vista friendly 
It's ok.... 
TRACKBALL 
Total battery hog. I'd recommend the corded version of this--not the newer model :-\\ 
Great track ball with a limited two year life span 
Not for me. 
Short battery life 
Works OK but is out of date 
Works well but receiver is too big 
works ok small black speck in lens 
\This should be standard Meade!\ 
Not the T-RING I needed for my Canon T3i Camera 
What you need to take pictures with your 35mm SLR camera... 
tiny screen 
Yeah its OK 
Good entry level PDA 
Small screen little memory...take a pass 
The only great thing is the price 
Why the prices keep dropping... 
fair pda... 
Bike rail circumference matters mount might not fit your bike 
Half works perfect 
Probably OK for the devices it fits (Does NOT fit etrex 10/20/30) 
Works but cost is too high 
Holds well but a little shaky 
Doesn't work with eTrex Vista HCx 
the clamp does what it should 
Not for Vista Cx unless you have \that little plastic piece that came w/the gps\ 
does not work with newer eTrex GPS units 
Works well with a few reservations 
Bad tolerances 
Useful for protecting your GPS but not that great

Quality Case But Difficult to See-Through 
eTrex Case 
Okay case 
You don't need it 
It is a Crazy World 
good but a little unpredictable 
Nice and smooth but... 
Solid and stylish but a bit uncomfortable 
Good if cheap--otherwise look elsewhere 
Just average 
Too narrow to be comfortable unless you have small hands.

Only Okay 
Seems to work okay 
Not what I expected 
Not what I was looking for 
Was good 
Not the quality I had hoped for... 
Works pretty good but kind of unsticks a little 
Be careful of your paint 
As advertised.. 
Good but eh.... 
ITs what it says it is. 
The adhesive isn't what I expected 
Price is a putt-off 
Too Small For My Cables 
Does the job but with a few crucial flaws. 
Oops: almost useless to me

Good quality - but small... 
Just OK 
Great bag but misleading tag

Quality excellent; functionality limited/disappointing 
What you would expect 
wish the cord was longer. 
Good quality...but 
THE CORD IS TOO SHORT 
It works fine but... 
Typical Canon - over priced accessory. 
money for nothing chicks for free...so goes the song 
Did not last long. 
Not quite what I wanted

Decent leather but does make M100 bulky 
Over-priced! However... 
Caution for M100 owners!

Still Buggy After All This Time 
Does the job but.... 
Preview of what is to come

OK 
Monster Cable Standard 
Fine speaker wire not as easily hidden as I had hoped

Why? 
Buy a Palm 
An interesting products that needs some bugs ironed out 
Nice gear 
Decent camera for the price 
JamCam + Windows XP = NIGHTMARE! 
A Disposable Digital Camera 
The blue version's review may be helpful 
Okay for limited duty. 
It's better than I expected for the price 
MMC card readers DO NOT work with this camera! 
Good Price Okay Headphones 
acceptable sound in a comfortable headset 
Pricey but necessary! 
Casio E-125--  a super product badly documented

OK for the money 
Was expecting better from Sennheiser!

Good sound poor details ... 
Good sound quality but lacks Bass 
Terribly Uncomfortable 
Review for: Sennheiser MX500 Lightweight In-Ear Headphone (Blue) with Carrying Case 
Compared to other earbuds for the price these compete well. 
10 feet at best. Better to get a straight cable. 
Works well but heavy...pulls on headphones 
Not really 20 Useful Ft 
Headphone Cord. 
Good for listening to music not for microphone use 
No 1/4\ to 1/8\ adapter. 
Alright 
Easy to use cable but complicated process. 
Worked for the first 6 months I used it 
I need both hands 
The cheapest looking wrist strap ever 
Uncomfortable 
Holds firm! 
Suitable 
So so 
does the job 
flimsy 
Still don't know how this works 
best computer investment tool you can have 
I guess it works 
Works but... 
Good price don't like the design of the snagless ends 
Belkin A3L791 
Good product 
Not USB 3 
It does clean 
Works ok....doesnt last 
Hey it is a cord 
Yawn.  Essential if you need it however. 
Beware 
Good quality but not Ethernet 
Probably overkill...

Modem cable 
Ordered 3 cables at one time 
Flip Flop

Good cables

It works

Just OK. Works. Not Snagless!  Get \Snagless Boot\ Type! 
Make sure you know it is an Extension cable Not a Replacement cable 
Good finish works fine 
Not really what I was lookin for but nevertheless a useful item. 
Good value 
Fine for your old Polaroid but kind of overpriced 
It's a cable for god's sake... 
Better than your printer's reader 
Belkin Cables Are Of Expected Quality 
Inexpensive hub for non-powered devices 
Lasted about a year couldn't use all ports. 
So So hope it at least works 
It serves its purpose 
A decent assembly of tools. 
Fairly decent toolkit 
great multi purpose not the best for computers 
Functional with one problem. 
Bad design no instructions 
Does ok seems reliable but annoyingly tips 
No size adjustment??? 
Really quiet but not built to last 
An okay toolkit 
Decent kit with a few caveats 
flimsy 
Items are of moderate quality and usefulness 
Good kit overall product quality needs improvement. 
well constructed but not usable with Vista 
Don't buy unless you have a headphone amp! 
Where Is The Treble? 
Like a suit of plate armor 
Very good sound quality but not comfortable for me. 
The good and the bad. 
Just so-so 
Would be 5 stars except..... 
It does work but not much excitement 
NOT A TRUE APC BATTERY - Misleading Image on SITE!!! 
works wish price was cheaper 
Cable is good quality but packaging is mediocre. 
Not too thrilled with this one! 
Good monitor...if it works 
It flashes after 6 month 
I had to return mine :( 
Received Used Filter? 
OK filter 
so so 
Vignetting on Tamron 17-50mm 
Capable of helping both create and mess up good shots 
Filter threads do work with Canon lens caps 
Affordable but... 
Works as advertised 
As expected for Tiffen 
Too thin and doesn't seem to be doing its job very well 
Vignetting a major problem 
lens needs cleanin before use 
Make Shure you know your ambient lighting 
Tiffen do I love thee? 
Gets The Job Done Does Not Come in Perfect Condition 
Nice polarizer 
Fits but Dirty 
Mixed results 
Learn about the ND filters before you buy one.

Gets The Job Done Does Not Come in Perfect Condition 
Ok at the very best. 
Works well 
Not strong enough 
A good filter for daylight landscapes..but not this particular filter. 
Fine but not coated... 
It flares 
Consider its limitations before buying! 
Easy To Use Causes Some Vignetting 
have reservations 
Better in theory than practice. 
Decent quality graduated neutral density filter 
Filter performs ok 
Does what its intended 
Not very useful 
I think I need one of these... 
This is an average product

It's OK

Great Filter But It May Not Fit 
OK... 
Experience with the 37mm filter on my Olympus M.Zuiko 17mm F2.8 lens 
If You Are Under Budget Constraints

UV Filter for lens protection 
Good Backup UV Protection 
TIFFEN 37mm UV Protector Filter 
Good lens protector 
Protect your lens but... 
Works great to protect the lens from damage! 
ok filter without coating 
Does one job well but botches another 
Not sure if it was me or the lens. 
Protects your glass but shows some ghosting! 
Not multi-coated but does a job 
Adequate & functional but disappointing. 
May be great product but slow delivery is annoying 
Not multi-coated.... not worth it

Could be better 
Inexpensive protection for expensive lenses. 
Fair for the money 
So-so 
Tiffen 37 mm filter

Not bad but if you're an enthusiast get Hoya or B+W. 
Simple effective prone-to-flare! 
May cause more glair 
Uv filter that causes lens flares and double images

Good but produces unwanted glare 
lens uv 
*Beware the Flare* 
Good option for a UV filter 
Needed it right away! 
Does the job 
Protection Filter 
It protects my lens 
This is what you get 
A little loose 
A UV filter is a UV filter. 
It's a middle-of-the-road UV filter 
Not necessary for today's lenses. Can help for lens scratching but they can cause sun flair. 
OK but wrong size. 
Loose retaining ring 
Nice filter questionable frame 
well....... 
Alright 
it is what it is 
Works affordable not mulit-coated 
bought only for cover protection my EF lens 
Alright item 
It's a nice UV filter but... 
Works With Olympus E-P1 14-42 Kit Lens 
Far from perfect 
It protects the lens 
Protects against dust & scratches but not against flare 
Good basic lens protector 
You get what you pay for 
Better UV Filters Out There 
Not so great 
Easily scratched 
Works mostly get some ghosting sometimes 
Cheap but it works 
Good for protection .. not so much for ghosting 
The loudest part on my camera 
Its ok 
Mostly Useless 
Good. 
Fine product great value but too thick to stack with others 
Filter works OK 
It's a piece of glass 
Good for the price 
Work fine. 
Good quality but poor results 
Tiffen 58mm UV Protection Filter 
For the price it is what it is. 
You Get What You Pay For

It's good but one problem... 
It works 
Perfectly fine for the cost. Be aware its uncoated

You get what you pay for 
Did not fit Nikon Lens 
Yeah they are OK - rookie's 2 cents 
AMAZON sent me a defective one 
Good protection for lens but horrible for photography. 
Average 
Ordered with my new Nikon D5200 camera. 
What can you say about a filter ?? 
A Decent First Filter 
Cheap filter protects your lens detracts from your photos 
UV protection not so great 
OK filter for protection 
Cheap and does what I need 
Good for multipurpose zoom lens and not for Telezoom 
Decent filter mine had a flaw in it though. 
Just so so 
does its job 
Good clear glass filter for lens protection 
not bad 
Hmmmm... 
Let me begin by saying the quality of the filters seems to be very good. 
Do as advertised but I'm not impressed by the quality 
Is it the Manufacturer or Seller? 
Useful for beginners 
Blue dye coming off Circular Polarizer 
To filter or not to filter is really the question 
No Adapter Ring Included No UV Multi-coating 
You get what you pay for. 
Work well 
a little small -  requires patience 
Not Great but Works 
Won't work with some control setups 
Can't access controls with grip in place - Lumix G 
Not the best fit on a Nikon D5300

They are great for the price BUT be sure you get the one in this photo 
Wonderful lens for learners 
Excellent photo quality - AF not compatible for D3000 
Great lens at an affordable price amateur oriented! 
Tamron AF 28 - 80 mm f3.5-5.6

Right for a light.... 
Better than the big plastic cases .... 
Limited compatibility 
Excellent features but is it reliable? 
Nice but I wish the screw terminals were not there 
this is a gender-changer not a null modem converter 
Works 
OK 
works fine looks like it was made in 1995 
NOT Rack Mountable 
Should have a better means to hold in place. 
May or may not get wall mount hardware
