Mortal Kombat Mythologies 
not the best but not bad 
Great controller 
Almost as good as the Sega one 
good

Highly playable shooter balancing looks and mechanics. 
Solid PS1 title/space arcade shooter

No Real Replay Value 
Fun but not the best Final Fantasy 
Stunning... simply stunning. 
the under-appreciated VIII 
an afterthought 
Pretty good 
Final Fantasy: The Standard of RPG's 
Great graphics but too much teen angst. 
Unwarranted Affection 
Dont believe the bad reviews it's actually pretty good. 
Beautiful Graphics Repetitive Battles 
A good play. 
Worth a play through if you've got a lot of free time 
Good game but it can get a bit tedious.

Decent for the most part 
From the most overrated FF (VII) to the most underated(VIII) 
The Best Mechwarrior Game ever! 
Great game - but download the patch 
Fun and intense worth your money but.... 
If Postal was an FPS 
Great 3D Graphics BUT... 
Awsome! 
and old game now... 
Feels more like a spinoff of Quake 2 than a true sequel 
Q3A 
I can't get this game to run properly anymore but it was awesome while it lasted. 
Heavy in story telling element a graphic adventure with a bit of action for kicks. 
They Shoot Romulans Don't They? 
A classic platformer 
Everybody loves Rayman 
A Trip Down Memory Lane 
Awesome sequel (4.5 stars) 
How do you explain this game? 
An engaging adventure 
Such a great game... If only it had stayed perfect... 
Definitely a good buy 
Much Better then the PlayStation version (except...) 
A pleasing expansion for a great game 
Great as a game not as an expansion pack 
Roller Coaster Tycoon Expansion Pack: Corkscrew Follies 
High Quality Low Quantity. 
I'd Give it 4 and a 1/2 if I could 
Shame they don't make them like this anymore 
Looks like the real thing... and I know about it! 
Extremely demanding sim - needs training module!! 
Solid. 
Why haven't they made Age of Wonders III??? 
nothing new but still fun 
Pretty good game 
Good improvement but not much! 
Explosive Awesome 
I'm slowly catching up on VG's so bare with me 
D*MN NEAR PERFECT!

Great but a little short 
What the Original Should Have Been 
Better than the first?

Great city-building game similar to Caesar 3 
Best of the Sierra CITY GAMES to date for me 
Excellent / Addictive 
Pharaoh lets you live forever... and you may need to!

A nice refreshing break from hack and slash RPG's. 
Different game lots of fun

Nothing Short of Epic  (but look out for the learning curve) 
A mix of DII and D&D 
Great nostalgic 2D fighting game that still has some life in it

If bigger it would be better. 
It does what it should. 
The best way to play PS2 games on a PS2! 
Absolutely amazing! 
Cheaper PS2 component cables do great job. 
the older the game the worse it looks 
Totally works but suspiciously barebones packaging with no instructions 
I wouldn't say the best for GBA......
