very average 
No widescreen copies anywhere? 
The Runaway Bride 
The devil put me to sleep...

Barbra Streisand lives with her mother. 
Not so good remake 
Not being a big fan of the slasher genre 
Great opening goes downhill afterward. 
Take out anyone? 
Good idea mediocre delivery 
Not what it aspires to be.

Every cliche in the book

Idle laughs... 
Awfully artificial 
Failed my 3-M Rating System 
SOPPY SAPPY TEARJERKER

Girl Inter- Jolie steals movie from Ryder- upted. 
Eh... 
Girl Interrupted ~Winona Ryder~ ~Angelina Jolie~

Audience Bored 
Whoop-de-do

More could have been done 
If You Like Hipsters This Doc is For You 
Pretty Bad 
Good Talent and Premise Wasted on Poor Screenplay -- Instead of a 1990's \Hot Rock\ we get Warner Bros Cartoons 
Bad Acting. Weak Plot. Incredible Destruction. Yaawwwnnnn! 
\I smoked him . . . like a Roman candle\ 
no...just...no 
Witches in Greenwich Village

Not Singleton's Finest Moment But Still Worth Watching 
Crazy behind the camera in Southern fried soap opera 
Boring 
Good performances can't save choppy film

This movie will break more than just your jaw... 
WOW 
A Watered Down &quot;Heathers&quot; for the 90's. 
morbid 
Lame High School Dark Comedy 
Jawbreaker somebody say something funny 
Heathers this ain't 
Teen movie tries hard but doens't succeed 
Boring romance with a twist ending. 
A Glacial look at English Blitz love 
Its lack of emotional depth left me longing for the end of the movie... 
It's No &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; 
The End of the Soundtrack 
Buck Naked Brits! 
There's something is extremely awful here

ILHM Reviews: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation 
it WAS!!!going very good!!!! AND THEN!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! 
\Welcome... to myyyyy world!\ 
The Adventures of Leatherface Queen of the Rural 
The performances by Renee and Matthew were only good things 
Disgrace to Leatherface Fans!!!!!!!! 
I'm sorry but huh? 
Bad but still worth watching 
Not nearly as bad as I was led to believe. 
At least it has a sense of humor 
A Decent Plot but a Bad Movie 
the Texas chainsaw massacre part 4 should be taken of the store shelfs and recalled 
Awful film barely saved by a couple of decent acting performances 
The Worst of all Massacres! 
The infection is spreading faster ... 
bad for two reasons 
Stick with the first movie 
Lame movie topped off with a bad dvd transfer 
A poor excuse for violence. 
Unforgivable ending 
I've written a song about this movie... 
A carbon-copy of the first movie...what's the point? 
BLARG! oh sorry... 
Don't waste your time 
Alice must fight the Nemesis. 
Better then the first...but that's not saying much. 
Not Even Near the Heights of the Video Game... 
Good action but they tried to do too much 
Alice! Who the (----) is Alice!? 
What??? 
Mind blowing 
First sign of the apocalypse 
Like 1st like 2nd - simple 
No atmosphere! 
Worse than the first one... 
Wretched Excess Piled on Top of Wretched Excess 
closer to 3 stars 
Dissapointed down right pissed off a times 
Wasted opportunity 
Mindless fun but where's the fun? 
As Cool as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! 
More Actions But Mostly Uninspired and Repetitive 
A 12 year-old with a $50 camcorder could do better 
Mixed feelings 
OK 
cute movie but fricken sad 
A movie from my childhood 
It's all about presentation and this film is presented in the worst possible way... 
HEART BREAKING STORY AND TRANSFER 
Entertaining flash'n'trash 
Swingers 
A few good scenes in an otherwise stupid movie 
Yet another weak &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; rip-off. 
Not that good. 
Unless you really really really like the tango avoid 'Tango' 
Great for tango fanatics but maybe not for others 
poor 
Unrealized potential 
Make up your own ending 
pure trash 
Save your money and buy a Greg Araki film 
It started out pretty good. 
Get off the road; immediately... 
Wasted Cast 
Uneven Sometimes Laughable Thriller 
Good Premise Undermined by Improbable Conclusion 
Immediately forgettable 
Not for me 
Good acting direction script... and yet incredibly annoying... 
Makes too many assumptions. 
We're all screwed? 
Mr. Bridges - what were you thinking? 
Arlington Road should have done a lot better than this 
Weak story poorly executed 
Good DVD -- lousy movie. 
Wasn't as good as I thought I remembered 
A classic of stunning ineptitude. 
LITE METAL 
Must have been out of my mind 
Heavily muddled... 
Heavily Disapointed 
I hate my eyes... 
Hideously over-produced loud garish spectacle 
Steven Spielberg is one of my all-time favorite directors BUT... 
A Spielberg Film That Just Sits There--It's Inert 
To little here for the kids. 
Even The Greatest  Can Get It All Wrong 
lacks magic 
This Peter doesn't soar 
MAGGIE SMITH MAGGIE SMITH MAGGIE SMITH 
Only the bedroom scenes were interesting and like the original 
Great Movie crappy delivery 
Too slow too poorly directed. 
Beatifully Boring

I'm sorry I saw this 
Shaky at Best 
Bobcat is Better as a Standup Comic 
Not what I expected 
Backfired in our case 
Too slow for us. 
Would have expected better... 
A Conflagration 
INCREDIBLE BUT TRUE ! THIS MOVIE IS ALMOST FRENCH ! 
Dissapointing Version of the Joan Of Arc Story! 
Is Jeanne a Heroine or Not? 
Burn this film at the stake!

Burn the witch 
A VISUALLY ARRESTING TRAVESTY 
Braveheart with breasts 
A Novel Attempt Ruined by A Poor Screenplay and Bad Acting 
Several great bowl-cuts but a stinker of a film. 
Overlong overdone over the top~~ 
Quantitative Evaluation 
well.....it was okay 
\Whatever!\ 
Jojovich stands out in this seen-it-all-before movie. 
Get Duguay's epic instead. 
Can't compare with the silent film 
This movie should have been so much more 
Still Looking for the Genuine Joan but entertaining nevertheless 
Who Was More Schizo:  the Protagonist or the Screenwriter 
Drives one to read 
No luck for Luc 
Turned it off after 20 minutes 
One joke movie 
Uh...

Typical Almod&oacute;var film. 
Lost 
Kinda Korny 
Watchable to say the least 
Plays best as a parody 
letdown 
Overt Child Exploitation That Never Redeems Itself Satisfyingly 
Memorable only for its novelty 
when your family may not survive you must still go to school 
Listless Fantasy Has Few Memorable Scenes. 
Don't Be Fooled This Movie Is Boring 
Stay away from this film. 
Oh if it was only a Phone call......
