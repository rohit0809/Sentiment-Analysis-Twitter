You might want to buy a single bar locally before you commit to six bars 
Great soap but can burn \southern parts\ 
I like this soap.. 
works great 
Great product but lousy Amazon Prime customer service 
like all of Dr Bonner's soaps very good

No biz like Showbiz 
Genesis 
An Inspiring Beginning. 
Powerful And Emotional Debut! 
Brilliant! 
Original and intense 
Muse just before their peak 
Its sounds kind of like Radiohead but its still good 
i loved this album but the lyrics are a bit trite at times 
My first dive into the Get Up Kids 
the bands best work to date 
rocking it with a soft touch 
Something worth checking out! 
Good but nothing to write home about

ROCK OPERA! 
Finally something different 
HAVE YOU HEARD... 
System Of A Down-Toxicity 
Damn they rock... 
A good effort 
Melodic heavy and as such... 
Good But Nothing Special 
Breaks from the norm...I'll take it 
Boldly where no band has gone before 
lacking focus but still incendiary 
Rubber Bullets 
toxic waste 
Best band in the nu-metal genre by far. 
It's been said many times before...

SOAD 
Good but the first one is better.

Why cant more bands be like this? 
Great message 
anti-myth rhythm rock shocker 
Tough tough review to write:( 
WOW...I was inpressed!

Nina Gordon + Bob Rock = Awesome Solo Debut 
Good mix of rock and pop 
No need to pass the salt. 
Sort of a less quirky Aimee Mann but it definitely rocks...

Veruca Salt alum scores big 
You'll listen to this AGAIN & AGAIN 
One of the better new bands... 
Very Good 
It's not the best but it's not the worst either

A classic back in print 
Digital remastering at its best 
The Drunken Sailor of Sardonic Wit 
A Liberation From Stupid Vanities 
if the last two pavement albums sounded like pavement... 
very similar to pavement's terror twiilight..... 
The truth about this album 
The Moment's Over. 
Good job Mr. Malkmus! 
Almost Five Stars but a tad boring 
Fun and Funky 
A step in John's upwards trend 
It is what it is 
A relatively well selected compilation of Lush material 
Music as colorful as the singers bright red hair. 
Great Collection Bad Remastering. 
every single time (history repeats)

The best of his later work 
Well This Sure Isn't A Crime

not the best but 
No five star album but very good 
This album has grown on me 
Don't let It's Been Awhile be your judgment 
raw emotions that leave you staind

it grows on you 
THE MAN TWO 
A pretty solid effort by Travis - it's not a great album but you'll probably like it if you're a genre fan 
Not just your average English band

A stunning follow-up to a classic 
Flowers In The Window. 
Beautiful beautiful music! 
Probably Better Than &quot;The Man Who&quot; 
No surprises.
