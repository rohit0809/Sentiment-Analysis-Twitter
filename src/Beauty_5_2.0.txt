It isn't extra conditioning 
Hmmm no.. 
Didn't like the smell 
?? Not sure about this stuff yet 
Great scent but not a strong hold 
don't last for weeks 
Stayed on overnight but... 
OK since it doesn't sting but the bond doesn't last long 
If it ain't broke don't fix it

Other reviews true 
Ehh 
Not great 
Too white 
Does not work for me 
DRY AND CLUMPY 
Dry and grey 
Bulky and underpowered 
The very best tool for ripping your hair out at the root 
Not into it 
Lasted less than a year 
Going back to a simple round brush and blow dryer. 
dont waste your time 
Not the best for naturally very curly hair types 
Stopped working after only a couple of uses. 
Awkward and  Heavy  to Handle 
I could not get it to work like the infomercials. 
Disappointing

Nothing much 
Muddy Looking hair.... 
WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR! 
There are cheeper alternatives. 
Thin oily yet dry hair 
It has sulfate 
wish they stuck to your eye lids :( 
maybe mines defective? 
I wish this moisturized better 
Leaves my hair sticky and crunchy 
Drying use for clarifying 
Money down the drain at least for me

Nope 
More of a clear with blue glitter than a blue with glitter... 
LOVE THIS STUFF !!!  ?-update? 
Organic straight 
Average 
Too rich for me 
These are not even close to Orthaheels arch support. 
Cute but no support 
Not for me but not necessarily a bad product. 
What's the big deal? Feels like Lanacane. 
Moisturizing/Hydrating Overnight Mask but NOT For Sensitive Skin 
This is not as bright 
A little dull a little small a little less than expected 
Honestly 
Absolutely NOT for people of color :( 
Exact copy of cheaper cody sand and sable 
NICE right out of the bottle but no staying power 
A bit flowery at first doesn't last. 
Don't bother 
Don't know what all the rave is about. 
so so brush 
Ive used better products.. 
just buy one product at a time 
Expense not worth it! 
Doesn't do anything for my hair... 
Good but...

vivo per lei eye treatment cream 0.5 fluid ounce 
terrible smell 
Not smoothing for my hair 
Scratch the scalp with sharp plastic bristles 
Not For Me

Strange combination of color! 
Color is odd 
not what i was hopping for 
I stopped using it 
Really magenta and a mess 
Pink not red! 
This is more of a mens scent 
Forgettable 
Too light 
NOT a good match for mineral makeup 
It's okay 
pictures speak 1000 words 
Not for sensitive skin!! 
I wanted to love this 
I don't know.... 
Still confused about what to do with this

Changing my review from \Awesome\ to \Not Awesome\ 
Liked the colors but the palette fell apart 
Not exactly colorful 
very talc-y

Love the colors but they don't last 
Very Meh... 
Males perspective Uhh NO 
Not worth it. Gross makeup. 
Its ok
