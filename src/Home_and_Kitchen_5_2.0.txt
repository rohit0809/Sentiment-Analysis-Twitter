Disappointing 
Cheap and hard to use 
Cookie Nutters For You! 
Wish I'd gone with Wilton's 100-piece set!

Not what it used to be 
Sloppy Fit but necessary item 
Not a lot useful stuff in it

Shreds okay slices horribly 
Not the easiest to operate 
I sent it B A C K! 
faster than trying to slice with a knife 
KitchenAid RVSA Slicer/Shreader 
Unimpressed 
Not worth it 
Returned it & purchased something else. 
They work even though they are short 
A poor substitute for a dedicated stuffer 
A lot of meat gets stuck in it. 
Better than trying to stuff sausage with a chopstick but only just. 
Cheap plastic won't last 
Does the job but takes a long time 
Works great... when it worked 
Pasta: Art or Science 
Surprised and disappointed 
Either does not age well or needs periodic maintenance 
Lasagna Yes Fettuccine No Spaghetti No 
Is it the right size? 
Good Idea but not worth the trouble 
Remember this is a \pouring shield\ as the name does imply... 
It was a great idea but needs redeveloped. NOT worth the $$ 
Just wasn't what I expected 
NOT for Classic Plus Stand Mixers 
Not so great 
Not designed correctly.

Love the filter buy the Brita 2-Gallon UltraMax instead 
Great if you want to tone your arms 
Black stuff 
Not sure if filters work. 
Hmm.. Brita filters are great but these weren't top notch 
Taste Fine. 
bad product! 
Not Quite Right 
NOT Accurate 
Sturdy poor craftsmanship 
Yes it does spray grounds

It's obviously not a KRUPS grinder 
coffee grinder by capresso 
well conceived but poorly executed

It's a pain to use in hardened ice cream 
Do you own a pyrex dish or a corningware piece?  If yes skip this. 
Performed well but... 
Sieve not fine enough for oil 
Mine had a manufacturing defect. 
Product description doesn't point out a \feature\ 
You have to lift it up from the bottle to allow it to vent even though....

Major dislike of Calphalon 
The coating is not good at ALL 
This one didn't do it for me! 
Calphalon One no where near the original Calphalon 
Own this and a whole set of these 
Calphalon now makes a good chamber pot... with a lid. 
Skimpy!!! Thin and sub-standard. 
Worst Calphalon pot 
Beaters are rusty! 
An electric carving knife should do a better job than this one did. 
hard to grip 
It cuts but is it worth it? 
Not powerful enough and on/off trigger is maddening! 
It's fine if you don't use it much........ 
Very low grade plastic cracked immediately 
Not worth the money or effort 
wanted to make blizzards 
Not very powerful 
Ok for occasional home use 
Not good for ice cream :( 
How strong do you have to be...? 
28 mins for 4 waffles? 
Not my cup of tea 
You get what you pay for

But then I still have an 8 track somewhere... 
Bring back the manual model 
Thermometer Woes 
Not a good value. 
Nowhere near \Instant\ 
Not \instant read\

Keep in mind it is a pocket thermometer. 
Broke very quickly 
I really wanted to like it

I'd hit that \Pause\ button before giving a  (5) Star Rating :) 
Unreadable

Doesn't stick. Disappointing. 
Doesn't stick 
Doesn't stick very well 
sponge holder? 
Broke after a few months 
Worked for 2 1/2 years - light use 
it never got finer than coarse chop 
DISAPOINTED 
Eh... no 
Avoid food processors. 
Okay for the price but the settings are not great. 
Crapola for a food processor 
Wish I had bought a bigger one 
Cheapens the Cuisinart Name (but is functional). \Chrome\ is plastic! 
so leaky! 
For The Home Chef&#8230; 
Worked for two years but didn't last like my old large processor 
didn't work 
Recieved a poor quality seconds item instead of a retail quality first! 
I love Fiestaware..but.. 
White glaze scratches easily 
Need to revamp their finishing quality control 
So sad so scratchy 
loved it until it broke

Horrible carafe lid Average tasting coffee 
Great coffee!  Lousy machine!!!! 
Worthless!! 
Love it - for a couple of years now only 2 stars at best. 
Not All It's Cracked Up To Be 
Ergonomics! Lacking Completely 
Good idea but doesn't work well in practice 
Does what it says but.... 
Looks Good Bad Design 
Works for me could be better 
You're better off with a separate grinder 
So many problems... 
Doesn't last 
Where do I start? 
Seriously awful; Glad to see I am not the only one who thought so! 
Burning smell 
quality control problems? 
Not worth it. Smells bad hard to pour from few features 
Smells like burning tires! 
Uneven heat and not hot enough

Don't buy it! 
Bigger than you think 
After 10 months of use..... 
great pan - for a while

it is difficulty to assemble 
They keep falling off the wall.

Arrived damaged 
watch out for loose handles 
Disappointed... 
Doesn't fit the pot 
did not fit my 10-in farberware skillet 
Cleans well but built on the cheap 
Chinsey piece of junk 
Buy the EXTENDED WARRANTY 
Cleans good hand tool sucks breaks easily 
Great short time steam cleaner not for the long haul 
Hoover SteamVac V2 
This cleaner is great....when it works! 
Cleans carpets well while it lasts - hand tools are a waste. 
Doesn't stay stuck on 
Terrible adhesives 
Size of the pressure cooker -  something is wrong !!! 
Didn't work for what I wanted 
You have to assemble handle etc. 
Breaks Easy 
going back to my george foreman 
Okay. Failure rate is about 1 out of 10. 
Save money & buy @ supermarket! 
Great product however ..... 
It works for what it is but really...

Makes good popcorn but also melts. 
No off-on switch flimsy top. 
No on-off switch so be warned

I bought this to roast coffee 
Not so great... 
Makes tough tastless popcorn 
Functionally good 
Oh Dear Oh Dear Oh Dear.... 
Presto Hot Air Corn Popper 
I am sad 
Makes the popcorn chewy and stick to teeth 
Didn't work as I expected

I disagree 
Good for standard yellow popcorn--not other varieties 
Presto Popper Purchased in 2013 
No off button 
like eating chewy cardboard 
Gack! Popcorn comes out chewy 
Uneven cooking 
It does what it says but bacon is a bit chewy.

Functional with annoyances. 
Flimsy - wouldn't recommend

Good Product BUT do not forget to empty 
I love it for keeping tea hot - not so much anymore 
Burn Hazard on High and No Keep-Warm Setting- 
Great size but. . . 
Way way too hot 
too weak for smoothies 
My kingdom for a can opener that can open Costco tomato sauce cans!!!! 
THIS is a real disappointment...and I do not know what \large\ size can they claim it opens... 
Not for the Long Haul\ 
Not Hot Enough - 180 degrees 
Worked fine except for the leaking oil!!! 
Not very good 
Avoid It...  Really 
Brita pitcher 
Great water flawed pitcher 
I changed my review from 5 Stars..buyer beware 
Makes no coffee half the time; only produces hot water 
Really wanted to love it 
Excessive grounds 
Great looking percolator but... 
Presto Coffee Maker 
Not your Mom's great old Percolator 
thought it would be time saving but its not .... 
It cut the carrots okay but not the vegetables I eat 
MUCH Smaller than it looks in the picture 
Buy a food processor instead 
missing parts and smaller than I thought it would be 
Should have more attachments for this price. 
Too complicated to switch between times 
Can we turn it off please? 
Not easy to use 
too confusing to use as a kitchen timer 
It was great while it worked. 
Meh 
Difficult to read the numbers on the face

Pretty but impractical 
Cuisinart WMR-CA Waffle Maker 
Teflon coating flaking off after &lt;6 mo 
Not hot enough 
Works okay but so cheaply made I don't expect it to last a year. 
OK first 2 years 
Warranty worthless 
Too flimsy 
A Woman's Perspective: Just A  Cute (Crappy) Toaster (NOT a toaster oven) 
when unplugged it does not come back on 
disappointed 
It's ok 
no bags! 
Good looking but disfunctional 
Wood Splits Every Time Even With Pre-Drilling !! 
Beyond Cheap 
This Stand Is for Light Weight Speakers 
These are not wood title is misleading 
Not that great. 
Love Lodge but hate \Pre-Seasoned\ 
Found cheaper at Walmart 
Not good 
Don't bother 
I think I got a bad one 
horrible 
Not like the old Castiron 
Doesn't work on a normal home stove 
Massive item. 
Food sticks every time. 
Great size but horrible heat distribution 
Stick (no pun intended) with the Original Lodge Pan !!! 
sticky little pan 
maybe I'm just doing it wrong 
Maybe cast iron is just not for me 
Rust issues with mine every time I use it. 
Hey there TINY skillet 
Never Got To Use It 
Non-stick? Please don't joke! 
Glad I bought it 
Pre-seasoning does not reduce sticking 
Eventually rusts 
Never got seasoned enough 
Not as seasoned as it needs to be for eggs 
Check the nutritional info and price 
Not quite as natural as I would like 
Rusted
