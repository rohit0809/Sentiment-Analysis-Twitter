gift 
Necessary evil 
Affordable but only somewhat dependable 
received item quickly and on time..

Wrong Ones 
They Work 
My First PDA but now I can pick a better one!

Background fuzz/feedback is noticeable. 
Works...for a while. 
Quality depends on vehicle

Came up short 
Copper clad aluminum wire 
Copper Clad not pure copper. 
good wire 
It works as expected 
It's frayed 
Not bad wire. 
I didn't need the wire. It is good to have it around as the price of precious metals go up. 
Cheap wire  but usable 
Inexpensive Speaker Wire 
I've seen better and worse cable. This is only so so so 
Good quality but wires are not clearly distinguishable 
16 gauge is 16 gauge 
Works just fine for light loads 
Well its wire. 
Good price for the length but thick insulation. 
It's just that....speaker wire 
Fine 
Seems thin but works for my application 
OKAY 
Good product 
Decent but it's not copper 
Good buy 
It's not 16-Gauge Speaker Wire

Does it really work? 
Flexible Pin type Connectors may not be the best choice 
Overpriced 
Overpriced but convenient 
Just OK 
Just okay 
Works fine 
Good Palm device w/ poor details - TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE 
Great speakers until the sub died! 
Slow. Slow.  Did I say slow? 
Nothing special. 
Happy & Sad To Have This Card 
Good Hardware But Bad Support 
ADD ON ANTENNA 
Remarkable 
GPS case 
Nice but could be bigger 
Not worth the retail price. 
Atlantic Wave 
Mixed 3 - above average design but WARNING:  unsatisfactory fit somewhat difficult to assemble 
Unneccessary 
Whatever 
They just don't last. 
Buy an aftermarket battery 
Works ok 
An ok battery for the price. 
Dim screen can't make up for other great aspects. 
Passable 
Not For Everyone! 
well 
coupler 
Excellent piece of engineering so so service though 
Good but not good enough 
Nice try but not yet ready for prime time... 
Great Product but Beware of Licensing Caveat (Licensing Stinks!) 
Difficulty taking sharp photos 
Worked good for about 2 years 
Product is Good and I like the price. 
Not as bad as everyone suggests 
For the price it is decent. 
Good camera in most situations 
Not The Best One Out There... 
Reliable  but inconvenient for travelers 
The case cracks 
Fast simple reliable but far from powerful... 
Poor Service 
not very versatile 
Pretty Good but i must have gotten it too late...

For the money it's worth it. 
10\ Speakers 
Awesome product USB 2.0 coming soon though! 
Way too sensitive 
Aarrgh!!! 
Hardly plug-and-play 
It could have been a 5 
Beware if you want to use this as a VPN server! 
Good MP3 player but not great 
SP50 is great... 
Not bad for the money 
Just OK for Expedition 
They hit for sure but the con. 
Buyer beware ... 
Old set vs New set 
Great sound but two serious design flaws 
Great Until The Plugs Died 
Been using this system for a few hours now 
Good sounding speakers until they die prematurely 
KLIPSCHIT 
Sound is OK but not the best - save your money for a Bose 
disappointing midrange performance 
I think Logitechs are better 
Great Sound BUT....... 
Good Speakers but cables and connections are very poor 
Whether they are working or not is a gamble. 
Satellite speakers sound great. Bass is weak. 
Expensive but good quality for computer speakers. 
volume adjustment noisy 
Just Okay- Nothing to write home about or leave a wonderful review here. 
Great Sound but Lasted 1 yr 
dependability 
UPDATED REVIEW - February 2012 
I've got some good reasons to disagree with 900+ reviews on this one... 
Owned them for a long time DIN Plug Flaw 
lower quality in current version? 
On the fence. 
TOO MUCH BASE FOR MUSIC 
Nice system with a few bizarre quirks 
Worked well at first unstable after less than 1 year 
Not bad but I can not recommend it. 
I think 256S100 is the right choice 
Old Technology but good for old PCs 
There are better options 
Great big bang for your buck 
Reliable yet slower than Sony Memory stick 
Slow on Nikon 995 
Extremely slow 
Good Value but Could Be Faster 
dont get it. 
Not for use with Multi-Media Cards 
Ok....Sometimes 
Remote Confusion 
OK DVD/CD player for the money you spend on it 
Almost perfect except 
Great for average listening 
Sony medium quality 
Great transaction 
Kodak MAX CRV3 Lithium Battery 
Here's the URL for the latest drivers 
Lots to Like but a few design flaws 
Only three words to say...... 
Consider the Archos \Recorder\ Line Instead 
Great storage capacity 
Good for the price.  iPod is much better overall 
It's fine but... 
Get almost what you pay for 
Better off getting a name brand 
Protection of your system thats all...rest is hype 
Ok 
Works well but a few minor complaints 
I like it but it uses both plugs in an outlet 
Did not fix the buzz in my subwoofer 
Seems to work OK. 
OK but beware of usual Monster hype 
Third Time's a Charm 
No better or worse than any other wire.  Much better advertising. 
Decent cable less than 100 feet 
Overpriced hard to pull 
MONSTER - VERY MISLEADING AGAIN!!!!  - length is only 80 ft. and wire is only 16 gauge !! 
Tried the cable with my subwoofer but could not tell a difference. 
wrong cable sent 
Good for light weight speakers 
Could it be that they make some cheaper than others???? 
Still Kicking it around 
battery's life is too short!!! 
Good but not Great Player 
Buffer doesn't work well over time. Awful for audiobooks 
Very good but not the best
