Doesn't work all the time 
Phone cord 
Slow charging doesn't sync 
broken in 50 days 
Maybe I got 3 bad batteries?? 
Great Customer Service 
was okay for a month 
No improvement over stock S3 battery 
Nice Case But... 
My Bad...I Ordered the Wrong Item 
Not Purple 
Fell apart :-( 
Too Bulky 
Quite Bulky 
Scratched on arrival 
doesn't fit as well as it should 
Not burgundy 
Not for me 
Honestly... 
Not worth it 
Nothing special 
Does not align with the shape of the device 
Worked fine for month 
Charger Plug Broke After 2 Months 
Cheap materials dissappointed. 
Ceramic or Metallic? 
The cord is heavy and you hear a lot of bumps 
can't stand the control button 
Echoes and cord length failed this product 
Average sound quality 
Mama Said Knock You Out 
Boo!! 
Broke within one year 
Could be me 
Hate it!!! 
Too slippery to hold 
Too big & bulky for my needs. 
Came with a crack in it 
Love OtterBox Products but this one is questionable.... 
OtterBox Commuter Series for iPhone 5 - Frustration-Free Packaging... 
Not a fan of the Commuter 
Very slippery. Bottom hinges don't like to stay in place. 
Decent Case. Breaks a lot more than the old Commuter Case 
NO THANK 
what's the point 
Cute but Dirty 
Over rated 
Shop around 
case does not hold up to its quality 
Not worth my money 
Deformed Body 
I wanted to love it 
You've got ONE shot... 
I thought it was a must-buy...I was wrong 
Larger than Phone 
Service is great idea is cool - original and it's replacement did not work. 
love the kick stand 
Ehhh... 
Got the wrong colors. Twice. 
Not a very good replacement 
Screen has Blue hue to it and is not as sharp 
Does not with all iPad versions 
Don't Buy unless you have to 
Good sound poor fit 
The old ones fit so much better! 
not back-compatible; loose in the ears (fall out); quality sound is at par no better. 
Apple only no matter what other phone you have. 
Genuine Original??? 
Cheap 
You can get twice the quality for half the price elsewhere 
they gave me a refund and I would have gave them an excellent review if it wasn't for the fact that one ... 
replica 
Not authentic Apple EarPods 
Materials are ok but sloppily constructed. 
cute but... 
Don't get this for your Note 3 get better quality. 
Does NOT protect screen. Feels cheap. 
It is grippy but the \fake carbon fibre\ is tacky and it becomes brittle 
You get what you pay for! 
Still not even close to Samsung Galaxy S2 Price is way too High! 
It's a great phone but not worth upgrading from 4S 
Cute but not very protective 
Ugly cheap looking case. Yeah it is cheap but there are other better options. 
ALREADY RIPPED!! 
Updated review 
Look elsewhere 
Wow!  Size really does matter... 
No cover/protection for power port 
not woth the time 
BUYER BEWARE 
TOO CHEAP 
Nice Cover but not really a protection if phone is dropped 
Cheap 
comment rating 
Really depends on your use 
Not the Quality Expected from Incipio 
Thoroughly disappointed with this case. 
The concept is nice but the product not so much 
Plastic casing not what I expected 
Utterly useless storage compartment. 
Unsure 
not that great 
Did not like case 
Just not my cup of tea 
Color not as depicted 
Good NOT Great Protection and Gets too Dirty 
Incipio's business model is very temporary satisfaction matched with advertising. 
Rubber stretches easily 
Didn't last long 
Buttons Do Not Work Well 
Color is NOTHING as described 
cracked after 6 weeks 
comment 
Power button issues 
Hated It 
Perfect Case except one big flaw 
not as nice as iPhone 4 model 
Teal green is NOT TEAL! 
You can't press the power button 
Paint came off after one month 
Better products out there. 
flimsy kickstand wouldn't stay on wood table returned it 
Kind of Ugly with Flimsy Kickstand 
I loved it at first after a few months - not so much. 
Loose conections. 
Belt clip broke first day 
Ok Case. Holster unusable. 
Bad case/clip 
Not for me 
Not good quality 
Not the Case for Me 
Scratched with no pressure 
not bad but 
Not much protection. 
think twice before you buy 
Nice case but doesn't fit right. 
Not The Premium Hard Case I Expected 
A disappointment 
Would not buy. Ended up buying another case 
for the price it's ok 
SLIPPERY! 
Ok. Not great. 
Hmmmmm 
Not all that great 
Won't protect 
Avoid 
Too slippery too heavy too snug 
Nothing Great...

Phone Case 
didn't work with my UNU iphone5 battery case 
Not for iPhone 4 and lifeproof cas 
sorry didnt like it 
You'll have to deal with Samsung's horrible customer service 
Not as nice as the iOttie smart tap 
Do Not buy the Flex 2 buy the One Touch 
Does not remain stuck to a perfectly flat dash 
Sorry can't share the enthusiasm for this product. 
iOttie Easy Flex2 was only okay... 
Too Sticky to Remove Easily 
Decent product but NOT for extended batteries or cases! 
It was fine in the beginning... 
Couldn't stand the test of time... 
I wish it had worked better 
Somewhat loose fit 
Returned 
Not a good value. 
Love the color! 
Good idea not a great product. 
Quantity over Quality 
White rubber on this case is a stain magnet 
While A Good Concept There Are Better Options Available 
It was a gift 
Not the Slider case of yore. 
Good idea bad execution 
Was great for two days and then my phone cracked 
Cheaply made 
A Generic Case Design 
Not so good 
Incorrectly titled iphone5 case 
great case 
Didn't fit my 5s well compared to several other cases. 
Doesnt fit snug 
eh.. 
I don't like the texture 
Ballistics are good. This model/type is not. 
too thin to really protect imho 
Wouldnt buy this again 
not so happy about it. 
Defective Screen Protector 
Would be decent -- if a 6 year old hadn't done the cutouts 
UPDATE: After 2 Months Was Too Dirty Would Not Clean - Had to Throw Away 
Ridiculously difficult to apply 
Don't like how this affects viewing quality ridiculously difficult to apply 
Anti-Glare screen protectors aren't crystal clear 
Not even close to as good as the older HBS-700 
Not for the long unruly hair among us or scarves 
Range sucks 
Disappointing for users of a previous model 
Not for Everyone 
Item returned 
Wanted to like them but sorry 
A disappointment 
LG says designed for bluetooth 3 or below - doesn't work well with google note 2 
Too cheaply constructed doesn't last 
Just got this doesn't seem right. 
I like but doesnt look new 
GREAT sound and comfort but a bad design flaw 
Bluetooth ear buds--NOT a headset. 
Unreliable bluetooth great sound when it worked. 
Pause does not work with iPhone 4S 
it's ok 
Very disappointed 
Disappointed 
Poor build quality and ergonomics 
Only Good for 6 Months 
Good ear buds - if they last. 
I was not happy with this device. 
Was an OK Product Until Something Better Came On The Market 
Two Stars 
Its ok... with some issues 
Better sound than HBS-700 but sucky at holding connection 
Connection issues 
TOO MUCH HYPE 
Privacy vs. Screen Quality? Not worth the trade-off! 
Not even a month later and it is covered in scratches 
Fits well but provides little privacy 
Good for portrait-orientation privacy but with serious caveats 
Two Stars 
Great Look Minimalist Protection 
Does the job but has something missing in the description 
Adapter for iPhone 5 
Only works for charging not docks or accessories 
Works for Hyundai vehicles but the design is poor 
High Price Does Not Ensure Compatbility 
it doesn't work with a case 
Not what I expected. 
Didnt work 
Crappy Design 
SEIDIO has poor quality control 
nice matte finish just didn't fit quite right 
Looks Good-Little protection 
Quality not very good 
Buttons are not accessible 
Get what you paid for

There are better options 
Wouldnt recommed this one 
This piece of garbage... 
A little off 
You Get What You Pay For! 
screen protector 
Eh 
Not what I expected 
Could still see everything 
Careful the color is not a true red - appears 80's electro-pink/red. 
Was SWEET; now: Don't TRY to take OFF! 
White gets dirty fast and can't be cleaned.  Flimsy bottom 
Is just ok... 
Black Amazon charge cord won't fit 
Silicone Great Poly not so much. 
Didn't fit properly! 
Cheap and wont last 
Lacking A Little 
Where's My Home Button and Why Is There So Much Lint? 
Not For Me 
Trade off protection vs clear view. This Iphone 5 screen protector is anti smudge but distorts the view. 
Textured not clearworks to prevent smudges 
Disappointed 
Questionably worth the money 
Too small for screen 
Not good for HTC One sv with case 
Very Flimsy case 
Terrible Fit 
I still had to use scissors after using this cutter 
Great speaker but missing USB charging. 
Fits but... 
Gets discolored and does not fit cable 
doesn't worth it prefer buying a $3 ebay one! 
Not a quality product 
Failed after a weekend of use 
Returned and got a 4 dollar case from an ebay chinese manufacturer that is similar but better than this! 
Complicated on the Bubble free promise 
Very Rubbery 
Not as stated 
Does not fit my well 
Good case....just not for me.

Seemed great but cracked open after a few week 
A so-so case 
Damaged when I got it 
Terrible 
Loose 
Does it's job kind of. 
Too slippery for me 
very tight with my iphone case i do not trust it very tight case 
Good for a bit 
Cheaply made 
Cheap and unfinished 
I stopped using it.

Sub Par 
Decent Film Covering but... 
Protects but scratches easy

Not premium at all just regular clear screen protectors. 
Mediocre

two piece 
So fragile and only carry a charge when at the perfect angle 
does not charge as fast a a regular cable. 
Case not really for anything but looks 
nice clear protection but the adhesive sucks don't expect them to last long. I guarantee they will peel off before you know it.

Too bad 
Do yourself a favor. 
Ok for charging not very practical overall 
Looks great 
Not a sonic upgrade from the 730 
It is Over Priced 
This product is shipped with only a usb cable for ... 
For the price it's disappointing 
dissapointed 
Be careful when ordering this product. 
Good idea but not very practical unless you have lots of CR123A batteries (or very low power devices) 
Not recommended. 
Why not make this rechargeable? 
Didn't work for me 
Emergency use only 
Okay in a Pinch

BELT CLIP REPLACEMENT MAYBE. 
Looked nice while it lasted 
Too slippery! Not at all what I was looking for... 
Eh... 
Slim fit good look good port access but too slick

Slippery When Dry! 
Good case not supported by the software 
Sometimes works 
plastic 
Well built elegant but mine has issues. 
Bulky and awkward 
I don't like this. 
I was hoping for better. 
Case is nice but so far the smart functions have been hit or miss 
Too heavy and bulky 
The hard plastic cover is extremely hard to remove. 
You have to be an expert at placing screen protectors 
Installation issues which should be revised. 
Not for me. Much too slippery. 
Look Elsewhere 
case breaks every 3 months 
Not too durable. 
Does its job but.. 
It's a darn shame these dont last longer. 
Not much different from the original battery 
Just say no to junk

Most difficult application!

Bubbles 
Screen Protects aren't very good 
Not that good 
sturdy product but... 
Wouldn't recommend 
Would not purchase! 
Thick 
Would be a fine headset if it would stay connected 
If you don't care about style

not a good fit on iphone 5s 
Nice and light but makes the phone hard to use

Belkin missed the mark in this one 
Not so orange 
Camera cut out is too large 
Wife did not care for the way it fit over the phone. 
No grip 
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWN BUT NICE CASE 
Don't waste your time or money

No value for money 
DesIGn is more like jelly beans and looks like cheap plastic. See my pic above. 
Not as expected 
Rubbery Grip 
no 
Cheap and you should buy something else... 
Big problem with scuffing on the back cover 
Nice Features Not So Nice Features 
Looks ok but difficult to put on scratches and doesn't feel good in your hand 
Traps dust like crazy 
Discolored quickly (WHITE Case) 
Received and sent back for refund the same day 
Good design but does not works with the same brand dock

Not sleek and scratches too easily. 
Would have given it 5 stars but it doesn't fit the adapter and some headphone cables

Cheap Look and Feel 
Sides became separated after just a few days - returning it 
Not grippy! 
BUYER WARNING!

Kind of inconsistent on where it works. 
Works great with some devices 
Okay I guess

Sound is not worthy of the price. 
Not recommended.

Too Bulky 
Quite Bulky 
Scratched on arrival

Honestly... 
Not worth it 
Nothing special 
Does not align with the shape of the device

Love OtterBox Products but this one is questionable.... 
OtterBox Commuter Series for iPhone 5 - Frustration-Free Packaging... 
Not a fan of the Commuter 
Very slippery. Bottom hinges don't like to stay in place. 
Decent Case. Breaks a lot more than the old Commuter Case 
NO THANK 
what's the point 
Cute but Dirty 
Over rated 
Shop around 
case does not hold up to its quality 
Not worth my money 
Deformed Body 
I wanted to love it 
You've got ONE shot... 
I thought it was a must-buy...I was wrong 
Larger than Phone 
Service is great idea is cool - original and it's replacement did not work. 
love the kick stand 
Ehhh... 
Got the wrong colors. Twice. 
Not a very good replacement 
Screen has Blue hue to it and is not as sharp 
Does not with all iPad versions 
Don't Buy unless you have to 
Good sound poor fit 
The old ones fit so much better! 
not back-compatible; loose in the ears (fall out); quality sound is at par no better. 
Apple only no matter what other phone you have. 
Genuine Original??? 
Cheap 
You can get twice the quality for half the price elsewhere 
they gave me a refund and I would have gave them an excellent review if it wasn't for the fact that one ... 
replica 
Not authentic Apple EarPods 
Materials are ok but sloppily constructed. 
cute but... 
Don't get this for your Note 3 get better quality. 
Does NOT protect screen. Feels cheap. 
It is grippy but the \fake carbon fibre\ is tacky and it becomes brittle 
You get what you pay for! 
Still not even close to Samsung Galaxy S2 Price is way too High! 
It's a great phone but not worth upgrading from 4S 
Cute but not very protective 
Ugly cheap looking case. Yeah it is cheap but there are other better options. 
ALREADY RIPPED!! 
Updated review 
Look elsewhere 
Wow!  Size really does matter... 
No cover/protection for power port 
not woth the time 
BUYER BEWARE

Nice Cover but not really a protection if phone is dropped 
Cheap 
comment rating 
Really depends on your use 
Not the Quality Expected from Incipio 
Thoroughly disappointed with this case. 
The concept is nice but the product not so much 
Plastic casing not what I expected 
Utterly useless storage compartment. 
Unsure 
not that great 
Did not like case 
Just not my cup of tea 
Color not as depicted 
Good NOT Great Protection and Gets too Dirty 
Incipio's business model is very temporary satisfaction matched with advertising. 
Rubber stretches easily 
Didn't last long 
Buttons Do Not Work Well 
Color is NOTHING as described 
cracked after 6 weeks 
comment 
Power button issues 
Hated It 
Perfect Case except one big flaw 
not as nice as iPhone 4 model 
Teal green is NOT TEAL! 
You can't press the power button 
Paint came off after one month 
Better products out there. 
flimsy kickstand wouldn't stay on wood table returned it 
Kind of Ugly with Flimsy Kickstand 
I loved it at first after a few months - not so much. 
Loose conections. 
Belt clip broke first day 
Ok Case. Holster unusable. 
Bad case/clip 
Not for me 
Not good quality 
Not the Case for Me 
Scratched with no pressure 
not bad but 
Not much protection. 
think twice before you buy 
Nice case but doesn't fit right. 
Not The Premium Hard Case I Expected 
A disappointment 
Would not buy. Ended up buying another case 
for the price it's ok 
SLIPPERY! 
Ok. Not great. 
Hmmmmm

Won't protect 
Avoid 
Too slippery too heavy too snug

Not for iPhone 4 and lifeproof cas 
sorry didnt like it 
You'll have to deal with Samsung's horrible customer service 
Not as nice as the iOttie smart tap 
Do Not buy the Flex 2 buy the One Touch 
Does not remain stuck to a perfectly flat dash 
Sorry can't share the enthusiasm for this product. 
iOttie Easy Flex2 was only okay... 
Too Sticky to Remove Easily 
Decent product but NOT for extended batteries or cases! 
It was fine in the beginning... 
Couldn't stand the test of time... 
I wish it had worked better 
Somewhat loose fit 
Returned 
Not a good value. 
Love the color! 
Good idea not a great product. 
Quantity over Quality 
White rubber on this case is a stain magnet 
While A Good Concept There Are Better Options Available 
It was a gift 
Not the Slider case of yore. 
Good idea bad execution 
Was great for two days and then my phone cracked 
Cheaply made 
A Generic Case Design 
Not so good 
Incorrectly titled iphone5 case 
great case 
Didn't fit my 5s well compared to several other cases. 
Doesnt fit snug 
eh.. 
I don't like the texture 
Ballistics are good. This model/type is not. 
too thin to really protect imho 
Wouldnt buy this again 
not so happy about it. 
Defective Screen Protector 
Would be decent -- if a 6 year old hadn't done the cutouts 
UPDATE: After 2 Months Was Too Dirty Would Not Clean - Had to Throw Away 
Ridiculously difficult to apply 
Don't like how this affects viewing quality ridiculously difficult to apply 
Anti-Glare screen protectors aren't crystal clear 
Not even close to as good as the older HBS-700 
Not for the long unruly hair among us or scarves 
Range sucks 
Disappointing for users of a previous model 
Not for Everyone 
Item returned 
Wanted to like them but sorry 
A disappointment 
LG says designed for bluetooth 3 or below - doesn't work well with google note 2 
Too cheaply constructed doesn't last 
Just got this doesn't seem right. 
I like but doesnt look new 
GREAT sound and comfort but a bad design flaw 
Bluetooth ear buds--NOT a headset. 
Unreliable bluetooth great sound when it worked. 
Pause does not work with iPhone 4S 
it's ok 
Very disappointed 
Disappointed 
Poor build quality and ergonomics 
Only Good for 6 Months 
Good ear buds - if they last. 
I was not happy with this device. 
Was an OK Product Until Something Better Came On The Market 
Two Stars 
Its ok... with some issues 
Better sound than HBS-700 but sucky at holding connection 
Connection issues 
TOO MUCH HYPE 
Privacy vs. Screen Quality? Not worth the trade-off! 
Not even a month later and it is covered in scratches 
Fits well but provides little privacy 
Good for portrait-orientation privacy but with serious caveats 
Two Stars 
Great Look Minimalist Protection 
Does the job but has something missing in the description 
Adapter for iPhone 5 
Only works for charging not docks or accessories 
Works for Hyundai vehicles but the design is poor 
High Price Does Not Ensure Compatbility 
it doesn't work with a case 
Not what I expected. 
Didnt work 
Crappy Design 
SEIDIO has poor quality control 
nice matte finish just didn't fit quite right 
Looks Good-Little protection 
Quality not very good 
Buttons are not accessible 
Get what you paid for 
Not a Samsung Note II Replacement Pen 
There are better options 
Wouldnt recommed this one 
This piece of garbage... 
A little off 
You Get What You Pay For! 
screen protector 
Eh 
Not what I expected 
Could still see everything 
Careful the color is not a true red - appears 80's electro-pink/red. 
Was SWEET; now: Don't TRY to take OFF! 
White gets dirty fast and can't be cleaned.  Flimsy bottom 
Is just ok... 
Black Amazon charge cord won't fit 
Silicone Great Poly not so much. 
Didn't fit properly! 
Cheap and wont last 
Lacking A Little 
Where's My Home Button and Why Is There So Much Lint? 
Not For Me 
Trade off protection vs clear view. This Iphone 5 screen protector is anti smudge but distorts the view. 
Textured not clearworks to prevent smudges 
Disappointed 
Questionably worth the money 
Too small for screen 
Not good for HTC One sv with case 
Very Flimsy case 
Terrible Fit 
I still had to use scissors after using this cutter 
Great speaker but missing USB charging. 
Fits but... 
Gets discolored and does not fit cable 
doesn't worth it prefer buying a $3 ebay one! 
Not a quality product 
Failed after a weekend of use 
Returned and got a 4 dollar case from an ebay chinese manufacturer that is similar but better than this! 
Complicated on the Bubble free promise 
Very Rubbery 
Not as stated 
Does not fit my well 
Good case....just not for me. 
the case for the 4 was better 
Seemed great but cracked open after a few week 
A so-so case 
Damaged when I got it 
Terrible 
Loose 
Does it's job kind of. 
Too slippery for me 
very tight with my iphone case i do not trust it very tight case 
Good for a bit 
Cheaply made 
Cheap and unfinished 
I stopped using it. 
Two Stars 
Sub Par 
Decent Film Covering but... 
Protects but scratches easy 
quality not great 
Not premium at all just regular clear screen protectors. 
Mediocre 
Good idea but cheap feel 
Broken 
Defective after 5 months 
Back covers not worth it. 
Ok 
Works for the money you pay 
:(((( 
cheap and not good. 
**UPDATED*** crap

Cons outweigh pros. I wouldn't recommend this. 
Arm Strap is Too Big 
Hard to get phone in and out 
I wouldn't recommend this armband... 
Too tight

Easy to apply matte finish 
Works but not a good fit 
Worse than the others that I had before this one...

Worth it to buy the real thing 
Works sometimes other times not so much 
Ports don't stay closed! 
BRIGHT blue sleep disturbing light and it separates easily into two pieces when trying to unplug it. 
You get what you pay for. 
Product packaging says \perfectly fit\ and couldn't be more untrue. 
Looks good on the picture not so good fit on the phone 
As expected 
You get what you pay for 
Pricey for a plain rubber cover. 
decent headset with an annoying flaw 
Cheap plastic bluetooth headphones 
Good sound but poor quality headset 
I guess under $30.00 is worth it 
Don't waste you money

Not a sonic upgrade from the 730 
It is Over Priced

Emergency use only

Too heavy and bulky 
The hard plastic cover is extremely hard to remove. 
You have to be an expert at placing screen protectors

Not for me. Much too slippery. 
Look Elsewhere

Use mineral oil and add other natural items - you can make your own

Buy a Capresso instead!!!

Great at first...nightmare later 
Horrible carafe lid Average tasting coffee 
Great coffee!  Lousy machine!!!! 
Worthless!! 
Love it - for a couple of years now only 2 stars at best. 
Not All It's Cracked Up To Be 
Ergonomics! Lacking Completely 
Good idea but doesn't work well in practice 
Does what it says but.... 
Looks Good Bad Design 
Works for me could be better 
You're better off with a separate grinder 
So many problems... 
Doesn't last 
Where do I start? 
Seriously awful; Glad to see I am not the only one who thought so! 
Burning smell

Cleans well but built on the cheap 
Chinsey piece of junk 
Buy the EXTENDED WARRANTY 
Cleans good hand tool sucks breaks easily 
Great short time steam cleaner not for the long haul 
Hoover SteamVac V2 
This cleaner is great....when it works! 
Cleans carpets well while it lasts - hand tools are a waste. 
Doesn't stay stuck on 
Terrible adhesives 
Size of the pressure cooker -  something is wrong !!! 
Didn't work for what I wanted 
You have to assemble handle etc. 
Breaks Easy 
going back to my george foreman

Presto Hot Air Corn Popper 
I am sad 
Makes the popcorn chewy and stick to teeth 
Didn't work as I expected

Presto Popper Purchased in 2013 
No off button 
like eating chewy cardboard 
Gack! Popcorn comes out chewy

Not for the Long Haul\ 
Not Hot Enough - 180 degrees 
Worked fine except for the leaking oil!!! 
Not very good 
Avoid It...  Really 
Brita pitcher 
Great water flawed pitcher 
I changed my review from 5 Stars..buyer beware 
Makes no coffee half the time; only produces hot water 
Really wanted to love it 
Excessive grounds 
Great looking percolator but... 
Presto Coffee Maker 
Not your Mom's great old Percolator 
thought it would be time saving but its not .... 
It cut the carrots okay but not the vegetables I eat 
MUCH Smaller than it looks in the picture 
Buy a food processor instead 
missing parts and smaller than I thought it would be 
Should have more attachments for this price. 
Too complicated to switch between times 
Can we turn it off please? 
Not easy to use 
too confusing to use as a kitchen timer 
It was great while it worked. 
Meh 
Difficult to read the numbers on the face

I think I got a bad one 
horrible 
Not like the old Castiron 
Doesn't work on a normal home stove 
Massive item. 
Food sticks every time. 
Great size but horrible heat distribution 
Stick (no pun intended) with the Original Lodge Pan !!! 
sticky little pan 
maybe I'm just doing it wrong 
Maybe cast iron is just not for me 
Rust issues with mine every time I use it. 
Hey there TINY skillet 
Never Got To Use It 
Non-stick? Please don't joke! 
Glad I bought it 
Pre-seasoning does not reduce sticking 
Eventually rusts 
Never got seasoned enough 
Not as seasoned as it needs to be for eggs 
Check the nutritional info and price 
Not quite as natural as I would like 
Rusted

Even at $54 it's not a good purchase 
Uninspiring Razor 
mediocre shave 
Not good 
Not good if you have much facial hair. 
Looks nice but does not shave well.  There are better options below this price point.... 
Why? 
OK for very short beards but very time consuming... 
Women are Hairy Beasties Too 
Not as good as past Norelco products 
Strange engineering! 
I wanted to like it 
It is what it is and it does what it should but not the BEST! 
Typical Electric Shaver 
Not really a lubricant...a spray cleaner yes! 
Redmond Clay 
Doesn't mix well and at 5 scoops is a horrible value 
not sure if it works 
Follow-up Review After Almost Two Years of Use 
WAY TOO LOUD 
I really wanted to like the Arc 4 electric shaver 
I'd prefer a more reliable less-close shave. 
Smells great but I'M PEELING! 
Wish it work but it doesn't 
Does not silent body odor! 
didn't work for me either...... 
Didn't like it there are better products out there 
It was ok! 
I don't buy the reviews

Not as good as leading companies 
Too thick and falls apart easily 
NOT SURE IF NEEDED 
To smooth 
Nothing new or extraordinary. 
I can't deal with the many times my skin keeps getting stuck in it!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Thick hair forget this product 
You get what you pay for... 
A Review of the Degree Clinical Protection 
scent stings the nose 
Incredibly Strong Smell 
not all that it promises to be at least for a man 
The smell turns and then wafts up at you. 
Didn't Like This One 
Those who seek natural products will want to avoid Degree Clinical Protection - contains Aluminum based products 
of all the clinical protections this is my least favorite 
Caution: leaves residue behind on dark clothing 
not that great 
Smell too intense.  Clinical is not much stronger than regular.  Directions say apply at night. 
Clinical protection VS regular 
Apply at *NIGHT*?!?!?!?!? 
Not good for sensitive skin***** 
I expected better from Dove 
I wanted to love this.

No power 
Way too strong for me

It's ok for quick jobs. 
Works as a steamer but does not clean well

EXCELLENT features 1 YEAR LIFE THEN NEARLY WORTHLESS 
Bad reaction 
Doesn't really do anything in my opinion 
My armpit still sweat. 
Didn't do much for my chapped lips

I couldn't tell any difference when taking this 
If you can handle the extreme sourness and are patient this could work for you 
Blech! Not worth the \savings\ 
Two Stars 
OOPS!

I really wanted it to work 
Scent too strong 
Works Okay But Not Much of A Deodorant 
Not a good value for the performance. 
Not a pleasant smell... 
Effective product for a questionable purpose 
It works.  That's the best part. 
No added value for added price 
Could take it or leave it. 
I Didn't like this 
effectiveness depends on the season not as good as a prescription 
NOT for sensitive skin 
Works well enough NOT a solid! 
The Real Cost: $56

No Better than Regular Deodorant 
ordered  for mom 
Deodorant is effective but the packaging is flawed

A *whole* lot of salt without much other flavoring to note 
Red and White are both too salty & lack taste! 
It's Okay But MSG? 
It is red rice 
This adds some savory umami taste to rice due to the MSG and autolyzed yeast but there is just way too much salt in each packet 
Salting Not Seasoning

Gummie-like candy with corn syrup and sugar as the first two ingredients ... where's the fruit? 
No strawberries were harmed in the making of this product 
Healthy Packaging Hiding Same Old Sugar 
20% Fruit (Sort of) and Not Vegetarian 
Poor packaging to food ratio 
Pretty \meh\ for a fruit snack 
A little disappointed in Kellogg's 
With a name like \Harvest Acres\ it should be organic.. 
There are better fruit-flavored snacks if they don't have to be strawberry 
There are better \natural\ fruit snacks on the market 
What's sweeter than any sweetener?  THESE! 
No berries were harmed in the making of these *fruit snacks 
Welch's and Target Marketplace fruit snacks are better

Tasteless 
Yummy but VERY mild 
Can't recommend it

A misleading way to sell oily tuna 
It may have Omega-3 but that's all 
Not Tasty 
dry low on Omega-3 
Overbearing flavorings not balanced or mild 
Artificial 
Had high hopes but...

Requires far too much to really be noticed 
Not worth the price

okay but the cheddar flavors are better 
Ok flavors but no one in my family thought there were wonderful or even that good

Sorry no Cigar for this one........ 
Not horrible but not great 
LET'S GET WEIRD FLAVOR: Not so good to me 
Do you really want your coffee roasted by a cable comedy channel? 
A failed experiment in my house 
Similar to canned vegetables 
A pretty expensive way to get a small amount of vegetables 
Good idea but so far this isn't for me. 
Half the box gone and I can sort of see the novelty... 
a waste. 
Doesn't taste like coconut 
Too weak for me

Band sounded really sloppy and much of the show drags... 
I liked about half of it 
By far this band's weakest effort 
A couple OK songs but too artsy for me 
Tool? Heavy metal? 
Oh Gimme an Aenima! 
thinking man's band for the average joe 
Prog-influenced?  I Think NOT... 
Tool - heavy metal 
Inconsistent and way overrated

Start Cryin' Zappa Fans: This Is NOT VERY GOOD..... 
more lumps than gravy 
Curious Zappa novices beware 
Wasn't quite ready for this one 
Avoid the \colorized\ CD and get the original if you can find it. 
A ruined version of a great album 
Find the Vinyl version and add two stars. 
Zappa loses his audience on this one 
Really really over rated 
descuido prolijo de un genio..... 
Not Frank at his best 
Imagine me and you. 
Highly over-rated by paid critics; I found this boring and mediocre 
Great Album. Poor Vinyl. 
Half-Baked Dada

The Weakest Zappa Instrumental Album 
I'd rather it be neither them or us 
Ick. My personal vote for the worst Zappa effort... 
Fish been laying on the dock too long 
Does Music belong in Humor? 
Zappa meets Firesign Theatre but he didn't get the drift 
Nice Bass Relief..... but... 
Full of intellect perhaps but sterile. 
Advanced yes amusing no 
Not one of Frank's better releases . 
Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar minus the charm 
Annoying snippets

Easy to put together but... 
Basically just a full sheet label 
Died after warranty expired 
Continuing Dissatisfaction 
Must've got a bad one !! 
I Cannot Stress This Enough - Stay Away From This All-In-One... 
JUST DOWNGRADED Very fast very versatile and VERY BIG 
It didn't work right out of the box... BUT... 
Huge nice quality -- while the ink lasts 
Lots of Fuss

Jagged Edges on Text Labels 
Trying to be fair & balanced - nice features but several problems & ink cost is no longer an issue (read on) 
Oh Brother!  What a hassle to get it running! 
The Brother Ink scam 
Brother MFC J835DW is not 2400 dpi scanner 
Good basic (read cheap) PPT presenter with one niggling fault and one FATAL flaw

Not great 
If You Have an Hour to Kill 
Could be made better 
UGH... 
good idea poor execution 
I don't know if the clear one was worth the price 
mediocre product that is overpriced 
A questionable value 
I think there are better products out there. 
Nope.  Use a nice greeting card instead. 
Poor Quality Don't Recommend 
Odd size extra heavy storage box 
water can enter easily 
Disappointed

Not for Business Shipments 
Not Thrilled 
Wobbly placement of laptop tricky fake ventilation

Very basic all-in-one laser with expensive toner 
Inelegant and Ineffective 
Totally useless as far as I can tell 
Meh 
Won't be order ink from Amazon anymore 
Not much better than scissors 
these are huge! 
I have to agree with several other reviewers on this one! 
Takes up two sheets of paper 
Unimpressed--not professional quality. 
Cool but  limited usefulness 
Major Setup Problems and No Paper Drawer 
There are better options than the MX 432 
Canon Pixma MX432 is not 1200x2400 dpi scanner 
Long term peformance issues;  scan has limited options and forced a USB connection... 
I'm staying away from this brand. 
Disappointing beyond the photo printing capabilities 
Nice Try but too much noise 
Laggy Poor cell connectivity 
Not too impressed 
A competent printer with horrible support 
Just Okay 
Bulky/clunky - wait for the next version (if there is one)

Bizarre settings... 
Does what it promises..or so I thought. 
Pencil is Good Erasers are Useless 
Returned it 
not the calculator for me! 
Assembly Required is An Understatement 
Kind of disappointed 
Overpriced annoying chore 
Not what I was hoping for... 
Not much ink. Good quality 
NOT EPSON ORIGINAL CARTRIDGES!!!! 
Ink is fine packaging terrible 
Why advertise that you can print postage from this wireless printer when it has to be hooked up via USB to do so? 
After three months it stopped printing correctly 
Almost Worthless 
Just cardboard really? 
Not Sturdy Enough To Be Useful 
Flimsy and unattractive... I threw mine away. 
Glad I Didn't Have To Pay For This 
Plain cardboard box that's way overpriced. 
Cheap cardboard file box 
It's a box 
A Basic Box (if it worked) 
I am disappointed with this 
A $10.00 cardboard box? 
Buy it and I think you'll be disappointed! 
Flimsy. 
Box seems sturdy at first but collapses when full of paper - definitely not worth the price--it's a cardboard box... 
Pointless by itself and not really much more than a cardboard box 
Cannot recommend.. 
I was expecting something more 
Overpriced 
must be a government job 
Useless! 
Redwelds are better than this 
Overpriced flimsy doesn't do what it claims 
Not worth paying that much for 
Not a strong product 
Good Idea with Big Problems 
The box it came in was sturdier . . . 
Colored cardboard file box that is nothing to write home about 
Folders- functional but not very sturdy. 
Expensive 'starter kit'... 
Organize your price comparisons before purchase 
Nine file folders 
If You Enjoy Getting Ripped Off Try These 
WHY? 
Too Expensive 
Basic filing starter kit charges a premium for generic life suggestions 
flimsy 
Overpriced and I actually tore it putting it together 
Lackluster... 
Too Expensive for a Fancy Cardboard Box 
Not Something That I Would Recommend 
Odd Design 
It's handy but flimsy

Pretty expensive cardboard 
Too expensive for what it is... 
Liked it until wrapping Christmas Presents

Not So Useful 
Don't waste your money 
New tool to learn 
Disappointing; Didn't Really Work for Me 
Destroyed my wrapping paper 
Promises To Be An Essential Everyday Product But For More Limited And Specialized Use 
Very limited applications 
Worked the first couple of times 
Worked great until the first time I dropped it 
DON'T REMOVE THE PLASTIC! 
Safe but very low quality. 
The Unkindest Cut.... 
Edited: this cutter didn't last 
Mixed Metaphor = Mixed Success 
Doesn't cut it 
Shredded funds 
Not recommended for Mac users - driver issues with wake from sleep 
Problem with power draw on print startup 
strong awful smell 
Luxurious Feel But Minimalistic Design Compromises Comfort 
Don't understand the purpose of these

Dispenser with no cutter? 
I'd Skip It 
Misleading Description and Photo 
Attractive but not durable 
Picture Misleading... 
Not like the picture 
Had issues w/jamming buckling of staples inside 
Cute but difficult to operate 
Just about everything is wrong about this product! 
Esthetically Pleasing but REALLY Cheap Stapler 
Pretty but cheap 
Darn 
Attractive 
Good Luck Getting Rid Of Apps 
Spend A Few Dollars More And Be Happier 
I wanted something that would create great photo prints - this isn't it - adds lines to the print 
Good as long as you don't use windows 8 or apple 10.8x 
Poor ease of use destroys an otherwise solid wireless all-in-one 
It's okay but.... 
It was working OK until a paper jam 
Can't recommend it. 
I seem to have been unlucky enough to get a faulty piece 
Some quality and toner expense issues 
Not ready for prime time printer 
Good Ticket Stock Poor Templates 
Needs better design options and heavier paper 
Quality tear-away sheets; terrible and non-intuitive template design

Not so fast 
So Far . . . No Good 
Scanner Error... 
Do NOT get this if you do scanning 
Snail pace picture printer 
Get the 545 instead 
buggy not intuitive not worth the cost of ink 
Nice solid little office or home office printer but can't remember date/time 
Not as easy to set up as I had hoped 
Good printer except for its very inefficient ink cartridge system! 
Doesn't Like Printing Photos on Photo Paper 
Excellent Printer Good Price 
Unusable? 
Just not for me... nice print quality but poor design and materials in my opinion. 
A little slow and loud; heavy too 
Way Overpriced Yet Decent Ink Cartridge 
Overpriced 
A Tale of Two Printers - and Two Different Levels of Customer Service 
Not A Good Mid-Back Executive Chair 
Excellent size but that's about it 
The ink cartridge issue overrides the positive aspects of this printer! 
Get what you pay for 
A Rare Miss for Pilot 
Nifty idea but not premium enough for the kind of people who care about notepads 
Weird 
Could be better 
Better in theory than practice 
Mediocrity 
Firmware Error in chip 
A pen is a pen is a pen 
This pen delivers the ink...but broke after a couple of weeks. 
Pilot Remains TOPS sorta 
If you're upside down in the rain... 
Floats writes when wet... just like a cheap ballpoint pen. 
I don't get it 
Not impressed 
Sharpens poorly 
Broke after a week 
Very Fast Sharpener that Lives a Faster Life 
It gets the job done sometimes satisfactorily. 
Poor Performance when compared to a Panasonic cordless phone connected to the same OOMA (telo) base unit 
Latency is a real problem...

Fun Idea With So-So Implementation 
Prints nicely BUT... 
Didn't work for me 
Do Not Pass GO. Do not collect. 
Poor quality scan 
Not So Super 
Needs to Come With Eraser 
Wish They Had Included Eraser 
Sharpens unevenly not much of a point 
laughably bad security 
Not effective for what it is inteded for 
Weak tape 
Not Going To Be Useful For Most People 
not for packing and shipping 
Unimpressive and poor for shipping 
A Scotch Tape That Seems Like A Good Idea But Offers Marginal Usefulness 
Ok for loaners .... those who don't return your pen! 
Pilot makes the best pens but not these.. 
Decent design but limited wireless range 
great idea mediocre execustion 
Too expensive and complicated 
Ridiculous 
Not impressed 
I found a better alternative 
Fits a Specific Audience Maybe 
An Answer Searching for a Question (Unsuccessfully) 
A clever idea but out of date 
There are better and less expensive alternatives 
I Don't Get The Purpose Of This Product 
Don't quite get it 
Works are advertised but not worth the cost 
This or a plain photo? 
Did not care for... 
\Technology\ for your notepad?

This is really just clear tape 
Fine only if you want cheap paper

Expected more for the price.

This started out as an excellent product that worked great even with colored pencils! 
Sharpener works fine but would recommend using it with batteries  not the USB connection 
Disappointment. 
Low-powered doesn't sharpen super sharp 
Junk 
They shoud add a sixth star.. 
Wrong product 
Not something I will use

Dissapointing 
Bubbling under plastic is unexceptable 
Cheap-looking plastic sharp edges

Not My Idea of Heavy Duty 
Heavy duty? 
Over Priced but........ 
Excellent Ring Trigger!  But Bendable Covers Tearable Plastic Does Not Accommodate All Inserts 
Not that durable and it's overpriced 
NOT \extra durable\ 
It's Pink!

Lightweight durable materials but poorly constructed 
Not Worth The Money 
Neither heavy duty nor durable 
Very Basic & Expensive Duplex Network Multifunction 
Large printer that doesn't have the wireless it promises.  Better and cheaper choices out there. 
Too Clunky - Tries Too Hard 
One 'not very useful' box 
Dead bug in my box.... 
Means Well But Cheaply Made 
Nothing stands out. It's a pick-off-the-shelf dollar product 
it's colored scotch tape 
Not a replacement for decorated Duck Brand duct tape. 
Wobbly as heck! 
The magnets all popped off 
Over priced for limited usage 
So-so construction and not very useful 
Thin 
Large but not the best finish 
If you want to put holes in your wall.... 
too thin for normal use 
Not Functional 
Flimsy 
Fails to Write 
Disappointing all around 
Cheesy 
You can write on it 
small writing surface 
This is NOT a classic chalkboard! 
Small chalkboard

Truly fantastic potential but I don't think it's ready to be out of \beta\. 
The Only Thing That Works With The Paper Tray Is In-Air Flight

It's A Pen.....It's A Stylus....It's Overpriced.

Underwhelming 
Just okay for Windows users terrible for Mac

Two strikes Epson you're out. 
The ink is too expensive 
Very Difficult Set Up 
Run away! Run away! 
Good prints good scans will not last. 
Handsome--but so far useless.

What is this 1983? 
No. . No. . No. . and more No. . . No. . . No. .  .and again No. 
Weak magnets and doesn't erase easily 
Cheap 
Not Worth The Effort 
Start up and connection issues 
Lots of problems with it. 
if you like your printers large bulky super heavy and only print in black... 
A great black and white copier that desperately wants to be a printer 
Black and White ONLY!!! added a few more nuisances

Flimsy and photo prints are of poor quality 
Cheap and warped 
Flimsy 
Frame is terribly cheap-looking 
Flimsy 
Save your money and buy another

Poor Quality 
Very light duty 
Not well built 
I Don't Get It 
Not very functional 
Not enough contrast 
Cheap 
Meh.  (I know crazy 'cuz how hard is it to make a 'meh' cork board?) 
The cork part is fine 
Cheap-looking cork board that cannot be hung only mounted with sticky tape that may not adhere to surface 
I guess you could call this an \off the wall\ review 
For those of us (you) that have nothing to do&#8230; 
Uses a Monday - Sunday set up instead of the more common Sunday - Saturday 
Calendar Begins with Monday. Ugh. Major Flaw for Month of March. Horrible Marker! 
Two serious flaws. 
Too small for family use. 
Very unfortunate. 
Don't even bother 
Love this type of board but this one has some flaws. 
Not terrible for the price but a few things make it hard to recommend. 
Slides down Refrigerator side/door...not magnetic enough 
One step above awful 
Nice Hinge Cheap Binder 
3 round ring binder 
Round rings 
2 inch rings 
Not Impressed

Not the quality I need in a binder 
Seriously Over-priced 
A cover tear and difficulty opening the rings makes this a no-go for me 
Plastic covering feels cheap thin not heavy-duty 
Okay but not Wowed 
Poor quality 
Quality leaves much to be desired 
Consider the price carefully. 
One is just as good as another right? 
The utility of this is much in question. 
Looks OK but not that great functionally 
Organizher 
Speaking as a List-O-Holic... 
Average Password Organizer. 
No tabs just page after page of URLs user names and passwords 
Good idea but wish it were sturdier and compartmentalized. 
Oh it's all too much for my pretty little head...!! 
Not Executed Well 
Too Many Problems 
62.5% smaller than advertised 
Hard to Use 
Doesn't Stick 
Not what I expected. 
By Far the worst item I have ever purchased online 
Really Not Useful in the Stores 
If You Use Quicken You Don't Need This 
A waste of paper 
Not useable by touch typists probably OK for hunt and peckers 
Only 4-10 sheets not 20! 
Too expensive not sturdy 
REVISED for your FYI! 
OK stapler but usless without staples 
Okay As A Throw Away 
No staples included but the skins are cool 
not good 
Just get a regular stapler and avoid hassles. 
Stapler is very low quality small and jams often.  Skins are cool but prefer ugly and functional to beautiful and frustrating. 
Heavy! 
Handsome Ballpoint Pen With Squishy-Soft Stylus Tip 
Seems Pricey 
Works... sort of 
Eraser Is One-Half Inch of Felt on Velcro and Does Not Stay Attached

Plastic Legs 
Updated: Padded Back Doesn't Stay Affixed 
Fast but not sharp 
4 out of 5 is a sign of over-reaching 
not particularly user friendly 
Color me frustrated - no template! 
Pretty Labels That You Can't Print? 
Multi-purpose but too bulky 
Super bright and functional but battery installation is a PAIN 
Big pain to change the batteries! 
Way too much work putting in the batteries 
Basically a disposable light good enough for what it is 
Not satisfied 
Not Worth the Price 
Disappointing 
Defective when received. 
Good but not impressive and with issues. 
Safer BUT !!!!! 
Two Stars 
Not for Sugar Ants 
Disappearing leaves 
I expected a bit better for the price 
Not Really for Weeding 
Just can't justify the price 
If it would only turn on 
how long will it last? 
Waste 
Don't get rid of the cat! 
Mouse in the House Maybe? 
Great housing for your mice 
Easy to use but not super practical 
good idea not so good design 
It is all wonderful except... 
Easy to use but.... 
Disappointed. 
A lot of plastic to kill a small mouse 
Generally Ineffective.....Use Only If Your THAT Squeamish

Waste of money 
Disappointed in quality

Not impressed. 
Didn't work at all on my lawn 
Spectracide 32oz Weed Stop Concentrate 
Overrun with snails 
Didn't seem to hold up. 
Horrible Packaging 
Hummers Not Interested 
SO disappointed! 
Way too small 
OK - I prefer to pull pork with forks. 
The trap wouldn't close 
It plainly doesn't work because it cannot keep away small pests. 
Not good for large garden. maybe good for small garden. 
lasted 3 seasons 
Not up to expectations 
Food gone but mouse happy and well fed 
Nothing Like The picture 
Not for squirrels even small ones 
Didn't work on rats 
It's harder to trip than it should be

beware of where the mice will die 
Not the one I'd choose. Here's a summary of them all: 
Can't use it if you have pets 
Clonex 
Too much money for what you get 
Lava Rocks are a Better Alternative 
Why pay for this when you can use other materials cheaper? 
Performs Well for Light Duty Cleaning 
Poisonous for pets and kids 
Mice ignored it if they die they do so elsewhere.  Poison is lethal to pets. 
Not recommended  the poisoned mouse can be eaten by pets... 
Too scared my cats or hens will eat the mice poisoned with this 
Misleading 
Are you kidding me? 
Expensive and only so-so solution 
Genius?!? 
Not worth the price 
It makes the flower pot marginally lighter 
Wouldn't buy again 
Many Dead upon arrival 
About half of the bugs were dead 
These are not native lady bugs and they bite. 
Requires Lots of Scrubbing 
Barely helped at all. 
too many problems 
Didn't remove mold from our house siding 
Even elbow  grease is not enhanced with this product. 
Krud Kutter HS01 Green Pressure Washer Concentrate House and Siding Cleaner 
Krud Kutter 
Line feed doesn't work edging is horrible 
I would urge you to avoid this product! 
Heavy and unwieldy with auto-feed that will not feed - buy another brand 
Just frustrating. 
Mine was defective dead website - who makes this thing actually? 
Died after about a year. 
Not impressed. 
Damaged sofa not once but twice:( 
Top of table has way too much \give\ 
A dissatisfied customer 
Doesn't blow hard enough and battery has poor life 
Battery is fine the rest is the problem 
My skunks are too smart for this trap! 
Not a better mouse trap... 
there should be more painless solutions for discouraging mice from entering the house 
Not impressed so far 
Maybe its me but it doesn't work. 
It works...but the big drawback is the delayed death 
Dud 
Had difficulty setting it 
Haven't caught anything - snap traps still the best 
Hard to push for less strong people 
meh 
My kids like the idea that there is a mouse catcher so that you can catch and release. 
Useless 
Clever but ineffective 
You have to keep checking it if you do not want mice duels to the death. 
Mole Teaser 
not as good as my old metal ones . . . .. 
Hasn't work yet! 
Maybe too sensitive for our sandy soil? 
Not working here 
The moles are winning 
Mole Trap 
Not impressed 
too small 
Lightweight but not at all powerful 
Mice did not like but if they do take bait they die elsewhere which could be not a pleasant experience. 
like all poison this might fall into the wrong mouths 
Not advisable if you have pets and/or kids 
Don't Change Things That Are Perfect! 
Decreased control from too much length weight 
Nothing keeps the deer out of my garden! 
So far the birds don't use it 
Looks nice enough but not too functional 
Started to rust in two days 
Better suited as a log holder or for magazine storage 
Attractive Design 
I hope they gave a bonus to the person that invented the spreader 
Says it's safe for the veggie garden but not safe on your skin... 
Looks better than it is 
meh... 
Cute but Ultimately it's For the Birds 
Form inhibits function. Birds were slow to adapt but eventually enthusiastic. Inconvenient for me 
Cute idea poor execution 
Not easy to fill & only small birds can fit on the perch 
No customers

Attractive to humans! 
Impractical Design

Clever Design but This Hummingbird Feeder Eventually Leaked 
Had to downgrade it. 
First one was junk; long awaited replacement was better. 
it is not really working 
Great solution in very precise circumstances 
didn't work but another product from the same company did 
It's Not Working

Sprayer designed cheap small crack = worthless. 
Another Mole Treatment Failure 
Great Design Trumped By Poor Quality 
Lacking the quality to be a good product. 
Not safe - at all. 
Too  Tiny 
not great 
Three dead mice? 
Not a better mousetrap 
Expensive and did not catch anything but snap trap did! 
To be an improvement it has to be better than the conventional snap trap... 
Haven't caught those critters yet 
After a whole year - not a single catch! 
Cheaply made & very small! 
Not big enough! 
Not very useful 
Not what I hoped it would be 
Good idea gone bad 
Doesn't seem to bother our snakes 
Sigh... It doesn't seem to work on Virginia raccoons 
Just OK 
didn't work for me 
Raccoons and foxes appeared more not less after application 
Didn't bother the cat 
It didn't work for my cats--they still lay all over my flower beds. 
Ortho 490210 Ready to Use Dog and Cat-B-Gon Dog and Cat Repellent 
This product needs to be re-applied after rain 
Flowers and Kerosene Smell 
Title is Misleading 
Convenient but broke pretty quickly 
Extremely high water pressure in an extremely low pressure hose. 
I loved this but it is a piece of garbage. 
Wasn't too sure of it but so far so good... UPDATE!!! 
Sprung a leak on the sixth (light) use 
Disappointing performance 
Didn't meet even basic expectations 
Frustrating first use 
Only 75 feet if you let the pressure build up 
What can I say... 
Expanding hose 
Does not expand as promised. Not good for many applications 
Lightweight but does not last 
Still waiting ..and waiting ..and waiting :( 
It Worked & Then It Didn't 
Maybe someplace that's NOT Alaska? 
User interface sensor responsiveness and fit/finish issues... 
Design Flaws ~ Awkward Top and Easy to Spill Seed 
Great Company but they missed on this one. 
Made In China 
This is NOT a \Squirrel Proof\ feeder.  See review for better options. 
Quality Construction But Very Frustrating Top And Far From \Maximum Security From Squirrels\ 
Bottom part too easy for squirrels to open and an update 
Very nice squirrel feeder! Keeps out only very low-IQ squirrels... 
Cheap imitation of the Squirrel Buster 
A poorly designed feeder that should be recalled 
Where are the birds? 
Bad Design 
Perky Pet Squirrel Slammer Bird Feeder 
No Birds At This Feeder Speaks Volumes 
Not bird-approved... 
Not durable 
squirrel AND bird proof! 
Squirrels can't get to the food but neither can the birds.  But works great AFTER a major alteration 
Attractive but they like my red glass perch-less feeder better 
My hummers avoid this feeder 
Mixed Feelings About This Feeder 
what a let down 
I don't think they like it 
Beautiful design cheap construction hanger too short! 
Hmmm... 
A small step up 
Window Planter 
Nice concept but falls short 
Stability and Width an Issue. 
I wanted to like this product but.... 
It works but it's a ripoff at current price 
If Not a Gift... 
Failed the first test of an insect killer 
Expensive and anemic 
Not great--look around for something else 
Good idea...  Sorry to say mine is just not dependable in daily use... 
Keeps the rabbits out of the garden! 
Unrealiable And Short Lived Solar Power...Expensive. 
Did not last 
Foam gone = good stink smell = not good... 
Gets rid of foam but leaves residue 
Reduces foam but makes the water smell badly and look cloudy 
Not thrilled 
A very expensive route to a teeny tiny garden 
I guess I have a black thumb 
Seemed to Dry Out Without Germination; I Guess I Do Not Have a Green Thumb 
I'm not impressed but I suppose some might like it. 
Great Those Just Starting in Gardening - But Expensive! 
It didn't grow....a tomato plant I think 
More of a science project than an herb garden 
Miracle-Gro 17002S Gro-Ables Salad and Herb Garden Kit 
You'll have a better easier garden if you buy starts at a garden center 
Questionable value 
A Mixed Bag 
Very humane indeed! 
Critter only went in; when unit was off 
Clumsy to use and only half way effective 
Not recommended 
The quality of this hose is questionable compared to others. 
Works well if at a low pressure but sure to break 
Second one I have had - lasted 4 weeks in total... 
Great without the weight 
Cool Idea/Problematic Design 
Birds Don't Like It But the Squirrels Do! 
I Don't Need A Squirrel Feeder 
Perky-Pet B00303 Fly-Through Wild Bird Feeder 
Not a good design 
Nice-looking  . . . but looks better than it works 
Not worth the cost or effort 
Somewhat aesthetically appealing not so much functionally 
Nice idea; poor execution 
Frequent jams. 
Much bother and gizmos 
Maybe we just don't have a green thumb... 
Not well engineered 
Bad joke? 
Good concept poor execution 
Perky-Pet 253 Oriole Jelly Wild Bird Feeder 
Much corner cutting frustrating documentation more expensive to operate than expected 
Not User Friendly & Not Worth The $ 
This University Extension Master Gardener is not impressed 
Too limited too expensive and not needed 
Not a good value 
The squirrels loved it the birds not so much 
Squirrel Bait 
not that good of feeder 
Updated Review. Great Squirrel Feeder. 
not the best feeder out there 
Not worth it 
Suitable under some but probably not most conditions 
flat back and top is too easy for squirrels to open 
It's flimsy and it leaks... 
Bear Waterer 
Concept Great Execution Poor 
Great idea bad execution 
Too fussy 
good idea but so-so design 
Leaks out like a sieve. 
One step above junk 
No Ants!---with this one. ** Changing my rating...sad! 
Too much \junk\ 
Neither positive or negative results 
Not too impressed 
Not for me 
Not ready for prime time 
This is a difficult product to review because of the assembly issues! 
Update - it lasted 2 weeks and then the blade bent 90 degrees on a root - a real shame 
too light not heavy duty enough for a grill cover. 
Other brands I'll compare here are a better value 
Big Lightweight Grill Cover 
Velcro straps pulled right off! 
Something has changed with this product 
I didn 
Great for short-term use... 
The Drinkwell Platinum is much better and cleaner product 
Noisy at times durability issues

Did not work for my dog 
Frontline Plus good for fleas not for ticks 
Must have got a DUD 
Frontline doesnt seem to work anymore! 
Super fleas 
Suspicious and I'm returning it

It all depends on the flavor you pick.... berry flavor is disgusting 
Bark Free - Almost there 
Too Sensitive 
Great looking product that my dog won't wear. 
I've tried every doggle out there and I'm still looking for something that works 
Does not work well unless you have perfect level ground. 
It kind of works...sometimes 
Set up is difficult for one person

Front gas block sight 
AR

Things should work when new. 
What easy install? 
Not for Real Firearm Use 
Not universal - Remington 870 fitment problem

Flimsy.  Don't waste $20 unless  going to mount it on a .22 LR or BB gun. 
Isn't perfect out of the box modification is needed 
Bi-pod Can be Easily Fixed 
Crap!!! 
Bipod kept getting loose 
Not for higher caliper weapons

Spend the extra money and get the Down East 1606 Frame 
You decide 
Beware of the packaging

Broke After 4 Holes 
Cheap and It Shows 
BE CAREFULL IT GETS VERRY HOT 
wouldn't buy another 
Totally ineffective as a clamp. 
Minimal clamping capacity and pressure 
another box cuter 
Blade slips out of locked position 
disapointed 
You get what you pay for 
It works but not well. 
Mounting clips were useful. 
Item was used 
Wannabe tool.  I tried to like it... 
not a good quality blades 
Dull Fast! 
Blastgate Needed  -  Not This One! 
Needed pop rivets to hold the two halves together... 
cheap-o 
Cost Way TOO Much 
LESS IS MORE 
I broke it out of frustration with the fence 
Very rough cut 
Good tool if you don't have a flatbar handy. 
rusted top 
VERY loud 
MY DRILLS WEDGE IN THIS HOLSTER 
flimsy and floppy 
Put your money towards a router with above table adjustment built in 
Not on my router 
Questionable quality 
Not really very useful

Not for Rotary Buffing with a \T\ Tool 
Finds large screws/nails in wood but not small ones

Wimpy wimpy wimpy 
Was this really made by Freud?

Hard to Use 
One of the worst routers I have used 
ONCE AGAIN - NOT WHAT WAS DESCRIBED 
Not a great choice 
Doesn't work very well 
Never really found the use 
Difficult to operate 
Do I need to spend $50 for this ? 
It's OK when nothing else works 
NOT a Review 
Templates do not center in the router base 
material breaks down in sun; designed to fail 
Don't waste your money like I did 
There are better ones for the same price 
Just the Facts!

Remote Mute does not work 
Excellant buy 
Short Life-span.

not for the advertised age range - this is a baby toy 
Needs tactile feedback uncomfortable to hold on a lap 
\Who's Scruffy Lookin'?\ 
not a fan of the new black series 3\// 
Only buy if you have no Vader. 
Too fragile for play.  Mostly for display. 
Welcome to 1995. 
Came with clamshell separate from backer 
Difficult for my 3 year old. 
Meh - not really worth it 
No 
Not that great 
Too hard to draw much of anything 
For Wizards Only! 
This may work better as a baby toy but... 
A dud 
Sadly unimpressive 
This COULD HAVE BEEN a great product... 
Not the best crafting tool 
Best part is having the string and elastic included. 
Clay craft - may be frustrating for some 
Not worth the trouble 
Thumbs down 
Daughter loved the idea but wasnt a fan of the product itself. 
Tedious 
Not Well Thought Out 
Poor Design and Construction = No Fun For The Kids 
Not put together well 
Not for the Obsessively Clean 
Disappointment from Crayola 
Not Very Impressive 
Not what we expected.

Not well done at all 
Mess free but what's the point? 
Messy 
Messy! 
Hard 
Huge Disappointment 
\BoringOma!\ 
The box wasn't much like the toy 
Good concept but poor quality

Great Idea if Markers Worked 
Disappointing quality from Crayola 
Disappointing color. 
Not worth it. 
Great Idea but Poorly Executed 
Ugh what a bad product! 
lost potential 
Do not get this for your child 
Not a hit at our house 
Love the mat colors too faint (If you don't have the box keep instructions to get markers!) 
Colors are very light 
If you get good markers this would be a nice set. 
Great idea but flawed markers too light. 
Markers don't work 
Great concept that falls short 
Crayola where's the magic? 
Not Enough Saturation 
As a set this is flawed but here is a fix. 
Markers are REALLY LIGHT 
Really unimpressed... 
Markers don't show up... 
No magic in this magic color? mat 
Great Idea but Too Many Issues... 
Flimsy and unengaging.  You can always see both images so it doesn't really work 
Meh 
Difficult Setup Mediocre Results

Found it boring 
Tedious assembly.  Can you endure it for the fun? 
Too Heavy to Stick on The Wall 
Not worth it 
Not Great 
It's Literally Okay. 
What has happened to toys? 
It's ok 
Not as much fun as it looks. 
Would not buy this again 
Wasn't aware that these were mini blocks 
Basically annoying toy

Very disappointed 
Well going to focus on the bad I guess. 
Price was right age was wrong. 
Stick with the Innotab 2... or LeapIt this year 
Skip right over this tablet!

A solid 2 star product 
For the love of God...just wait people!!!

Weak effort from Lego. 
Not sure if it's a wise game 
Lame

Cheap Flimsy and Comes with Only One Wrestler 
So-So Toy 
don't bother with \frame game\ -- looks like fun but it's impossible to use as directed 
I just don't see the point where's the storage box? 
Couldn't convince anyone to get into the game 
Rather Disappointing 
A sad shadow of a great game. 
No box! If you like to store your games in neatly stacked piles this will drive you nuts!

My Kids Were Not Very Impressed 
Not well made 
The idea was cute but.... 
Julius will go down the short slide and that is the best I can say about this lame and unimaginative toy 
If you have money to waste

You will have fun 
Did you know that the Mini PS2 has some problems? 
Turned my Mouse into a Traitor 
Overrated 
So much potential but the difficulty really prevents most players from getting very far 
Generic garbage

Can We Think of a New Party Idea? 
It'll take the fun right out of your party 
Maybe I am missing something. 
Crime against original - in space noone can hear you cry 
Quite boring 
10 minute long scenarios is tedious and not fun 
so dull so boring....

Not like the sequels. 
Disappointing 
The Movies Did Not Diserve This Game 
Doesn't live up to the name of the Movie 
Great graphics but takes too long to get to action.

Beautiful game frustrating gameplay (2.5 stars) 
Frustratingly good fun. 
Promising but falls short 
Pretty but... 
horrible control setup struggling to even get started with this game 
Rubbed me the wrong way I guess. 
Not a good cable... 
It worked... a bit 
funky errors and frusterating camera angles 
Too Addicting 
The Best Game Beta Ever Released as a Retail Product 
God-like Micromanagement 
Tedious and Slow 
Black the game overall is bad: White it starts out good 
Over-rated and over-hyped. Buy THE SIMS instead. 
Simply not fun.

EA Production Staff should be ashamed! 
Yawn. 
Beautiful to look at not much to play at 
Well....I guess its OK....kinda.....sorta 
Good at first but too repetitive 
this game could have been better 
This would be an incredible game. . .

HUGE potential mediocre payoff = tons of fun for a 1/2 hour 
made obsolete by GTA3 but good for the youngins
