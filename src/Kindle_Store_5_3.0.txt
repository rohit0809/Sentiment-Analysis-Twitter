Meh not one of her better ones---Spoilers

kinky but well written 
Submissive 
Allright - ok start to series

This one is for the mystery fans 
Somewhere between really good and so-so 
Characters hard to like 
typo's 
A good plot 
An Evil Shadow 
Not bad 
AN EVIL SHADOW 
I give it a MEH. 
Really 2 1/2 stars 
Way too much technical detail for me 
Short stories no build up 
Double trouble 
Not a bad short story but the ending was obvious from the start 
as predicable as the falling snow 
Let It Snow. 
I don't know about this one 
Why aren't there half stars? 2.5 would be generous. 
A little girl in my room and other stories 
it was better then i thought 
Some Good Stories Some Not...

An entertaining read 
Enjoyable... 
ok book 
Enjoyable 
Okay reading 
Plot isn't really the type I usually gravitate towards 
A brush of love 
Chances 
I guess I'm odd woman out - just o.k. for me 
Entertaining pleasant story 
Regency romance with a kick 
Slow 
First half 4 stars second half 2 stars-average 3 stars 
don't compare with others 
Not quite as quirky as I'd expected 
Wanted to slap Alice but still wanted to know how it ended 
Keep reading - it gets better! 
Enjoyable 
hero is just as sick 
Worth the Risk 
Three stars for writing.. story.. well... 
Good writing but just a snippet 
Not your typical zombie story... 
Eh...not much to say. 
Scream Of Angels 
Euthanizing Gramma 
Blind blind blind 
This was a so so book 
blindingly fast moving short contemporary romance

Amusing 
Okay but not up to usual RLH standards 
Not much here 
Quirky short story. 
Theme still good but way to many swear words 
An  OK book and worth the price 
i liked book 2 much more than 3... 
Must not have impressed me as I can barely remember it. 
Better than I expected 
Too many sub-plots. 
A Good Read 
Heavens on Fire Is Another Enjoyable Read 
Always a Bridesmaid reviewed by The Book Vixen 
Good story but not as developed as I wanted it to be 
OK 
It's okay 
A good read 
3  stars.  Mostly intense erotic sex.  The supporting story was good.  The only negative was the short length. 
Short and hot but I wanted a bit more story 
It was... entertaining 
an \OK\ work 
Good story - some editing problems - coarse language 
Quick Introduction but Not Necessarily Balanced 
His majesty the Prince of toads 
Ok 
Two broken people trying to put heir lives in order 
A litttle different 
very well laid out 
Cannot come up to expectations 
Good Book 
Just ok.. 3.5 
it could have been so much better 
Hmmm... 
quite interesting 
nothing special 
Just ok... 
Cute Story 
She looked deeply into his eyes and wondered what he was made of. 
Wonderful for women of a certain age... 
Funny and True to Life 
Quite Boring 
The stories are ok but too out of date for my taste. 
Interesting 1800s Writing Style 
Tribulation 
Not bad Not Good 
;0) 
Too harsh 
Too short 
Dark and unromantic.... 
Not the best in the series 
entertaining shapeshifter/vampire romance 
Mediocre 
Falls short of being truly satisfying 
Wonderful creativity in first half but repeated rapes made it depressing.  Incomplete ending.  You need to read the sequels. 
Mediocre romance 
Too short feels incomplete 
Good story 
A good read! 
It was OK 
It is what it is... 
quick read no surprises 
still good but not her best work 
Needs to be longer 
Not my type of reading but some may enjoy it.

It's Okay 
My only complaint is..... 
Not impressed
