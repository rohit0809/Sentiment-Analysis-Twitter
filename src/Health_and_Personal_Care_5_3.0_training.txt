Adequate 
Can do light holding 
Not the best shaving soap but convenient if you like to face-lather. 
Only Available As A Shave Stick 
The under-the-rim brush doesn't get under our rim 
It works but thought it was the bleach

Caveat emptor 
close shave 
Doesn't work well if you shave infrequently 
Over-priced Over-bladed 
great 
Works great 
Great shave but way too costly 
Good product to add to your Amazon purchase.  Knocked off stars because of Gillette's confusing product system. 
I like it because it is cheaper than the same brand at the store... 
Ugh 
Expensive but good 
Save your money. These blades are a rip off! 
Blades Good 
Great product 
Fantastic but not in my &#34;club&#34; anymore 
Good but not much better than others 
an objective review. 
more expensive blades not a more efficienct shave

Works Better for some than for others 
Eat first! 
Felt dizzy & wierd! 
HOW DOES ONE RATE A VITAMIN? 
a neutral review for this one 
I LIKE OTHER SUPPLEMENTS MORE 
Don't buy this in bulk. 
I would suggest buying the 6 foot hose instead 
its ok 
Won't get the really big stuff off. 
Better to get whole seed & grind it yourself 
Didn't like purchased for price though 
So far so good 
Only a slight improvement... 
Great for leg cramps 
Ok for stainless not great does streak 
Dog treats eh? 
Your Mileage May Vary

Hoping For it to Taste Better 
High protein yet bland flavor aftertaste and dry cakey texture 
A little bitter not very peanut buttery but 20g of protein in 80 cal is great 
Meh. Tastes like nothing much. 
Higher in protein than most competitors 
Taste Could be Better. 
I liked the taste but it does have sugar alcohols. 
Only if you need sugar free and gluten free 
It tastes okay but not very peanut butter-ish 
Love 'em but not the calories. 
Too dense 
Decent tasting a bit dry 
Texture and taste a bit off 
Protein filled pipe dream

Tastes Like Suffering 
Just OK 
Needs some work 
Nutrition and hunger-saver 
Grainy chalky peanut butterness... YUM
