Not an early adopter here 
dont see much advantage to this product 
Pretty Ho-Hum. Good if you want a case and a charger in one - or you are really lazy. 
Good idea - I guess!? But is it necessary?

Too Quiet 
Uncomfortable 
I bought two of these 
Not too impressed 
Functional but mediocre performance poor sound quality and some annoyances 
May or may not work but cheap enough to try! 
Much better sets out there - not good for the price or functionality 
Didn't live up to the hype 
Power button is a deal-killer 
Ear phone piece never worked out 
get what you pay for 
This phone didn't work well 
Basic phone but poor even for the price 
It just isn't good. 
Sad phone 
The phone is a failure for Nokia 
Extended battery or just an extra large battery 
Doesn't Maintain a Reliable Connection to Verizon's Network 
Flimsey micro usb will damage Iphone backside 
Worked great for 4 months 
PRETTY but has some major problems.

Not very good 
Non Adjustable 
Great sound lousy bluetooth lousy comfort 
Worked great for a couple months 
Not for me. 
motorola stereo bluetooth headsets aren't worth the cost. 
Dissappointed! 
Poor Bluetooth Connection 
Wonderful until they broke 
Great Battery life easy to use but dies quickly 
It's not all that! 
Uncomfortable and iffy opperation 
Not good enough.  Battery life way overstated.  Phone call quality fair-to-poor. 
I must have a weird head... 
Great Sound but Doesn't Work Right With iPod 
Decent Sound Hurt to Wear 
Definitelty Extends the Battery LIfe

A good concept but it needs work

You will need to buy extra charge-in plugs. 
Didn't work out the way I thought it would. 
Unnecessary 
It's the little things that get you... 
Good idea impossible to execute affordably.  Use a charging station instead! 
I'm underwhelmed. 
It Costs Too Much for What It does...More Tips should be Included 
Not an early adopter here 
dont see much advantage to this product 
Pretty Ho-Hum. Good if you want a case and a charger in one - or you are really lazy. 
Good idea - I guess!? But is it necessary?

A waste for the money

Looks can be deceiving 
Great case

Just there! 
Fragile slightly blurry 
I got suckered into buying this Urethane protector...$18 down the drain 
Difficult to apply and looks \plasticky\ afterwards 
I thought it was a good product for the price but it didn't last. 
Nah 
May need to find a better case. 
Too big for an iPhone 4s with a Speck CandyShell Grip case and it smells bad. 
Cheap for a reason. 
Not the best protection but looks nice.
