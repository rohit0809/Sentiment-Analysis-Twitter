It does its job but it's nothing special 
Biggest Loser No There is Some Value Here 
Good idea but too big. 
I'm not that impressed 
It's a dry erase board 
Good as a Reminder 
Works for it's purpose but too disposable after that 
Expo White Board with a pre-printed chart 
Great for a workout! 
Not that motivating 
Good Printer - Freezes after long periods of time - No AirPrint 
Progress or regress? 
Slow But With Some Good Features. A BASIC Printer. 
Okay printer 
Basic Scanner. 
A reliable all in one printer 
Thicker not always the best. 
Thick not too sticky 
The roll is really small 
not save much 
No better than others I've used 
Looks good punches great stores well... but I hate to empty it 
Paperpro 3-Hole Punch 
My heart was moved the holes were not. 
Cuts well waste removal not so much 
Doesn't contain punched holes securely 
Lightweight 
Good 
disappointed 
so so with my mac 
Good but could be much better 
Disappointing right out of the box... 
Good printer but too long installation 
Average quality with poor software 
Capable but not well refined 
It's a toss up between this or the Canon MX870 
Excellent Value but Driver Issues 
It works 
keeps it cool but... 
Not opaque 
Hard to straighten out 
Good Quality 
Very Nice Matt but supplier needs to improve their packaging 
Go ahead and add $50 to the price tag. 
Not the greatest 
Not half bad.... 
Middle of the pack 
Great printer - if you have a PC 
a little expensive.  Compatibles work just as good. 
Good but over Priced 
can only load about 5 pages at a time 
Good cheap printer 
I agree...this printer uses a lot of ink..welcome surprise (see my 4/30 update) 
Summary for Mac Users only....good printer overall 
Wireless with touchscreen and apps but issues reduce its rating - UPDATED 2013 
Questionable for small business 
Strange Combination 
Meh 
Cheaper than ordering from warehouse stores 
Same taped together bags as reviewer logan 
Oh Well... 
Good product for the price 
ITS ALIVE ! 
Attractive but does not stand the test 
Good printer for the price 
You get what you pay for 
Bought it for the HP Reputation 
Not good for wireless printing 
The \Alien Creature\ printer... 
Wireless but not much more to offer 
Not recommended for Mac users 
Larger label area...but will you see it? 
Don't see the point of the gianormous tab; but nice for GTD 
A step down from my old office chair but for the price it's all right. 
Nice in photos but dissapointing in reality 
Really won't work well with mac wirelessly 
Great for home computer not so great for tablet 
Received this printer about three hours ago 
Three Stars 
IMPORTANT - Google Voice Support Ends May 15 2014

Small tabs 
Strong Smelling Plastic 
Avery Erasable Mini Tab Dividers 
Durability of Plastic 
Arrived Incomplete? 
Attractive good quality but difficult to write on 
Good Binder - 3.5 stars 
No more or less comfortable 
A few drawbacks..but otherwise ok 
Nice enough dividers the labeling process is a bit drawn out though 
Great Dividers Hard to Get Right Printer Labels 
Sturdy overcomplicated 
Sizing off for Covey planning systems 
good label maker 
Small and fast but poor print quality and limited tape size 
There Are Better Label Makers 
Easy to use cartridges pricey 
Dymo Label Problems 
It Makes Labels: Computer Required! 
MINI Binder.  Small size:  5 1/2 x 8 1/2  Just ok... 
Specialty sized which limits use. 
Ok as a binder pocket is impractical 
Nice Enough Odd Size 
Nice little binder but nothing special 
Hold It! 
Caution - filler paper is hard to find 
Nice useful item but doesn't close evenly. 
Decent Small Size Binder 
Odd size 
MATEIN-OFFICE 
Doesn't last very long. 
Not A Shred Of Evidence That This Is Up To Fellowes Quality 
Ummmm maybe my unit is broken?  But it has trouble doing 3+ pages... 
has limitations 
It Makes Labels: Difficult to Read Screen! 
How to measure your size for this chair. Not for someone very short or very tall. 
Average Low Cost Chair 
With a name like basyx... 
My LEAST Favorite Chair By Hon-But OK. 
Nice looking chair soft leather? affordable and easy assembly 
Overall Good Few Problems 
Love the screen hate the computer 
Nice features but frustrating to use 
For the money this is a good chair. 
Greedy for ink 
Bulky monochrome lacking features 
Does the Job 
uncomfortable to hold 
Not as good as other Jetstream pens 
Not as good as.... 
a nice pen overall but I prefer a thicker line a softer point 
You Have to Scribble on Scratch paper to Get it Going 
Nice pens but more of a ballpoint 
Not bad not great. 
Still smears and doesn't write on glass or sideways. 
Just Another Rollerball Pen 
What can you say about a pen? 
High points and low points 
They write ok 
Good But Nothing To WRITE Home About 
Longer 
Not as good as some of my other gel rollerball pens 
Needs a stronger suction cup 
Portable project helper 
good idea but 
Not really one-handed 
Limited use and awful mac software. 
Mixed Review 
Great at first 
Do not judge the chair on the first day alone. 
Okay office chair 
All the bells and whistles but still like my basic fellows P600C better 
I personally love to shred documents it might even be a fetish... 
convenience limited by small bin bad design slow speed 
Nice for letter-sized paper but struggles with non-standard sizes 
Not worth $200 but great concept otherwise 
Only good for flat non-stapled paper 
Frequent jams 
Swingline Stack & Shred Hands Free Shredder 
Good at What it Does but Plenty it Doesn't Do 
Handles 60 sheets at a go (sometimes depends) 
Interesting - clever idea not sold on the execution 
Has Quirks 
When it works it's great... 
Shredder works as advertised but temperamental 
Doesn't work as promised .. 
ok 
I prefer the Staples Springloader 
Arrived not assembled properly. 
Doesn't staple flat 
lookwise is good 
Useful but has some design flaws 
Super-light touch light-duty stapler best for anyone who can't use a normal stapler 
Decent compact stapler 
A functional stapler with mediocre aesthetics. Some confusion about what staples it requires. 
Not quite as promised 
It came with no staples and I never could get the thing to work! 
Pretty but I prefer the classic Swingline 
ok stapler 
Swingline SmartTouch Stapler is so so 
A light use stapler that the students love to use 
I don't love it. 
I do not recommend this 
It's okay - My preference is a regular stapler 
A good idea with some flaws 
Weird highlighter. 
These are okay but I guess I'm a traditionalist highlighter user 
A Highlighter That Sure Is Different 
I'm not overly thrilled. 
Low-Lighters 
Like highlighting with a crayon 
Bright but thick 
Novel idea soft feel highlighter but not really much of a highlighter 
Nice but not great 
Gel Highlighters they aren't your parents' office tools 
Good Product - Limited Appeal 
It is fine but not as solid as I would like. 
Over Whelmed by the Keyboard Tray 
Heavy. Good length. Installation not as easy. 
keyboard tray 
Heavy duty to a fault 
Good but not great 
Decent product but value? Not so sure. 
Quick and Simple 
Happy Holidays 
Attractive convenient expensive 
Unimpressed 
Failed to Interest 
Decent but not as good as some of the other brands we've tried 
Not  bad but not my first choice in workbook for kids 
Didn't hold interest 
Currently doesn't compare on price or performance with the Fellowes W11-C 
High price reduces its value 
This shredder is an 'okay' product 
Not bad but missing the \auto on\ feature. 
Swingline Paper Shredder - Good quality but pricey 
A cut above...in some ways 
not so great 
Ok but not great. 
OK but 
Ink Takes Too Long To Dry And Smears Easily 
Smudgy and they bled over my hands 
Like the pen not the mess 
Worked well but I did have one blowout 
Nice but not as smooth as stated 
average quality 
writes very smoothly a little messy 
Writes smooth but is a bit gloopy. 
Nice Feel but Has a Few Problems 
Not my favorite BIC 
Sometimes a pen is just a pen 
Nothing special 
Too thin! 
Decorated Bic Pen 
Prefer regular BIC Cristal pens 
I couldn't resist... 
Works Fine But Is Just A Pen 
Just a pen. 
Seems to me it's just a thinner pen than the \regular\ version 
Too thin; plastic is cheap 
Prefer the Original 
What's the point? 
Decent pen 
skinny pens 
More specialty pens please Bic! 
Really Now We Have Separate Mens and Womens Pens! 
Slender pretty and smooth-writing 
But what are they? 
not bad 
Multi Part Review 
Great Idea But Not For Heavy Lamination 
Staples pages no good for bulletin boards hard to load staples 
Better Staplers Available... 
Light Weight Handy Little Stapler ! 
Just ok. 
As a vine reviewer 
Works well but has design flaws. 
Okay but not perfect 
50/50 !!! 
Too lazy to complain. 
Fellowes Bankers Box easy to put together 
Nothing Special 
Good for a gel pen but I'll stick with my Zebra ballpoint retractable. 
Not as mightier than a sword 
Writes well 
Nice Art/Testing Pencil..but some lose their grip with time.. 
Lovely line uncomfortable grip poor lead handling 
Great Pencil! Update: the lead constantly needs to be pushed down! 
Can't use headphones with these phones! 
Good but not great. Read Update 
Power supply problems... 
USB Cable Not Included 
Have a work around now.  (formerly Good for PCs Bad for Macs) 
Can be wired or wireless but not both:  wireless eliminates scanning 
Good for Windows users. Not so good for Mac users. 
Good all in one printer but not a photo printer 
Multi-Function With Some Malfunction 
OUTSTANDING functionality.  Not so stellar print quality. 
Some great features but some really annoying ones too 
Unimpressed 
Installation Was A Huge Headache But Not a Bad Printer Once Working 
Decent but not great basic inkjet printer 
Persnickety little machine 
Great idea that just doesn't hold up... 
Great Idea in Theory But of Limited Use in Practice. 
Overpriced 
Just okay 
Repositionable and strong 
Very handy for clearing up paper clutter 
flat 
Good with flaws 
So far so good... but anticipating problems 
sturdy 
Need more room! 
could be really useful but doesn't store much 
Interesting Idea 
Nice Idea But Flawed Design Makes For Limited Use - Sometimes Bigger IS Better... 
Useful but no help for the organizationally-challenged 
OK 
Durable but pricey 
cheaper options for your printer 
Acceptable Not Great 
Great Printer -- Rip-off on Ink Supplies 
Good but some problems especially with a Mac 
A word of warning 
Horrible set up.  Meh quality. 
Lovely Colors and Patterns 
Divided Fancy But Not Especially Sturdy 
Beautiful Design But Flimsy 
Lovely but Somewhat Thin 
Surprisingly Thin Index Dividers with Psychedelic Vibrating Colors that Hurt My Eyes 
Only if you love the design and need not touch them often are these a good option 
Pretty patterns but very thin 
Attractive but flimsy. 
A little thin 
Cute Not Top Quality 
Pricey for paper 
pretty but very flimsy 
Pretty But Far Flimsier than Expected 
Useless Pocket 
Very stylish but not particularly functional ... 
No Pockets - Bummer 
Pretty but sadly flawed... 
Eco friendly 
A Nice Looking Reasonably Priced Binder With Several Flaws 
5 star if you have large desk 
Not a standout but not too bad either 
Will Love it If you don't need the interior pockets... 
Its okay 
Looks can be deceiving 
A little pricey 
Pretty for home use. 
Understated Binder For Work But Comes With Warning 
3.5*  \It was the Best of Binders; It was the So-So of Binders.\ (with apologies to Dickens) 
Seems pricy but it's quite nice 
Flimsy 
Sturdy. Lightweight. Potentially Toxic. 
Looks good but some quality control issues and seems a bit pricey for what you get.  Not sure about that Prop 65 warning... 
Wilson Jones Recycled Bliss Binder 1\ 
Okay but No choice in Design 
Cute but Extremely Stiff 
Could be improved 
Pretty binder 
This is an adequate binder of its type 
Nice Enough But Not Worth 8.00 
Love the style but the execution is subpar 
nice but... 
Lovely binder 
Cute cheap binder 
Some Nice Qualities Some Less So [3.5 Stars] 
Pretty but stiff 
Not what I expected 
Definitely easier to use but requires special staples 
Heavy duty could not use with regular staples 
Five-star stapler handicapped by an inability to use regular staples! 
Not the best not the worst 
Laser pointer works great but wireless remote isn't compatible with Windows 8.1 
It's okay 
does it have to be this big? 
It's not too terrible... 
Quiet easy to use 
I'm Trying to be Fair Here but... 
A good quality that must meet market pricing 
Strong folders but the sliding tab??? 
Motorized Sharpener requires 2 AA batteries 
Works but not with confidence 
Cute little doodad gizmo thing but not as good as it should be. 
Manual vs. Battery Powered 
With a little effort it does the job 
Grip is nice but pen is nothing special 
For portability and quick easy scans a bit pricy. 
Cute Yet Heavy 
need LOTS of room on your desk for this good for teens 
Love Notes 
Cute but pretty big! 
Not really sure this has much use 
writes excellent erases okay! 
Best erasable pens on the market BUT ... 
Nice pens but thought they were refillable.  Will probably not buy again. 
Small and cheap 
Random frame color is ridiculous 
Servicable but cheap 
Handy little whiteboard for the office home school etc... 
Not a big fan 
Nothing special 
Inexpensive lightweight and functional. 
okay 
What you see 
Quartet Magnetic Whiteboard 
Fine but nothing special 
Weak magnets hurt an otherwise decent product 
General advice is to lubricate shredder cutters from time to time 
Nice product but not economical 
Brother TN 450 compatible 
Out with the old in with the new... 
HP creates massive confusion with their numbering system 
good ink 
Be sure you understand what \magnetic\ means . . . 
Desktop Realestate or mouse pad? 
Massively massive mousepad 
The Dually of Mouse Pads 
For Decoration More Than for Practical Use 
Too small to be very useful 
Works well but has limited applications. 
Limited Use 
Mediocre 
Okay but they stick together (minor curling too) 
Can't do much better or the price 
A mix of great and not so great. 
Returned Second Set 
Good 
Two Out Of Five Handsets Defective After Less Than Two Years 
Busted speakerphone great range uses standard AAA NiMH batteries outstanding audio quality 
Works well but a really a bit out of date already. 
Phone review 
Needs More Space 
Not so useful for keeping track of schoolwork 
Well made cramped for space 
Love this calculator.... I loved it until 
Uniden Quality Has Dropped 
Cool designed product that will look great on your desk although not completely functional... 
Too big too shiny too bulky--but it works just fine 
Just OK 
Watch the weight limits and the old paint! 
Not Strong Enough 
Could have been awesome if they had done it right. 
Too Much...And Too Little 
Nice phone but no easy way to screen calls 
Just Average 
These are ok... 
Works Well does Not Dry Out 
Great applicator but glue dries a bit cloudy and white 
Not Really Crazy About the New Packaging 
Does what you want it to do - with greater ease due to the applicator 
Designed for convenient reuse while sacrificing strength 
Handy for sequins and flatbacks 
Great idea but they could use some improvements 
Lots of colors and handy brush tips 
Regular Sharpies work Much Better! 
Easy to use but watch what you use it on! 
Disappointing results 
Good product but it was the wrong model # 
Nice design and features; good sound quality (at low volumes) poor range 
Okay \Sticky\ keys 
OK but Panasonic equivalent is better 
Nice Cordless Phone But 
Good Phone System. Excellent Sound Quality. 
looking for a cheap phone 
Decent pencil but not the best choice. 
Good Chair But Leatherette Material Cracked Badly After 16 Months 
WARNING: BUY A USB CABLE FIRST! 
Constantly having trouble with Mac 
The printer is excellent the supplies are expensive 
Very nice with some flaws 
Beautifully made but one major flaw - the safetly lock makes Repetition difficult! 
A little bouncy but useful 
Works well and looks nice 
bouncy. 
Not sturdy enough except for a tablet 
Office printer?  Yah right. 
Great for teen & kids 
Fairly handy... not very strong or reusable 
Works better for smaller paper products 
Nice alternative to sticky tak 
Sticky stickups 
Good for notes and postcards but not anything substantial. 
Alternate for magnets and tape 
Only work for small light objects 
Good and Cute When Used Wisely 
Sticky and good 
Works fine but needs better usage instructions 
ink cartridge 
If you can find them cheap get this one. 
Nice smooth writing pens but a little light in the hand. 
Write nicely but watch your fingers.... 
You Get What You Pay For 
Smears 
Decent pen but not top shelf 
Penned 
Fussy click mechanism good for leftys 
The ink skips! 
4 stars is maybe a little generous....maybe 3 is also too generous 
Satisfaction varies with your specific needs and expectations 
Great colors! 
Mixed feelings. 
What's the big fuzz? I don't get it 
Cute... but not really for me. 
Nice pens cool colors! 
\SMOOTH\ INK AND CONSISTENT COLORS 
Just like any normal papermate pen 
these pens write the color they are 
Great price great colors - if you like ballpoints! 
Bright colors cheap looking body 
It's a set of pens 
Light colors are always just too light 
nice 
good ink lousy pen 
Liked it serves its purpose well! 
The quality is questionable but it functions fine 
Ok post it notes but prefer the original 3M Post-Its 
These are fine - but nothing unique/innovative 
Not as good as Post It Notes 
Not sure of its usefulness has some issues 
Plastic is not good + smears with gel pens 
Good idea but be careful 
A different look and feel 
Not Sure These are Worth the Switch 
Plastic-y texture makes many pens run on this sticky note 
A teacher / graduate student review 
Great for ballpoints -- not for gel pens 
an innovation you can do without 
I can see clearly ...sorta 
Abit too transparent... needs work 
Paper vs Plastic 
Nice Idea but Not That New 
Cute accessory..but not necessary! 
Cool idea but not perfect... 
Okay depending on what you need 
Kind of a mixed bag 
Underwhelming 
By now a bit of a comodity product. 
Need better adhesive 
nice but with built-in shorts 
comparable to POST -It flags 
They're adequate. 
COULD BE STICKIER 
They just don't Stick Around 
These are Sticky Notes . . . 
Bargain basement stickies 
Works as well as Post-It Notes 
Recycled makes a good product eco friendly 
Good product but there are better ones out there 
Acceptable sticky notes but I prefer Post-Its 
Not so Sticky 
Good sticky pads but wasteful 
See-Through Sticky Notes 
Perforated Sticky Notes 
Perforated Sticky Notes 
Decent sticky notes but don't give me a reason to leave Post Its 
Up to the job 
Average 
Not Quite as Good as Post-it Notes 
Hey It's a Sticky Note OK 
Post It's a Better Value 
Fine.  Small differences from post-it notes. 
O.K. product not priced competitively 
Not To Bad But Could Be A Bit Better 
Basic 
Maybe slightly better than Post-Its 
Quite Colorful - But Not Very Sticky 
Great for Writing on 
Unnecessarily useful... 
Disappointing 
Not what I expected 
A comparison 
Fine & Useful... but nothing truly innovative 
ok for what it is 
Could be better designed... 
Product works well enough 
OK if you write tiny; otherwise too small 
Great size & paper quality but... 
Cute 
Useful for organizing shelves and files and stuff like that 
Great Idea. Not Great Material. 
Really Get Your Attention 
Limited usefulness; writing smears -- Post-it brand is better 
Clever idea but not as versatile as I would like 
Nice product but has some limitations. 
Bright but maybe see-through not such a great idea? 
Good not great 
Handy note pads but better? 
New Twist on old favorite 
Nifty idea 
OK but not my personal preference..... 
Ridges in the paper 
Ordered the wrong one 
It's paper 
Pink Pen 
I Like It But... 
Are you a printer paper aficionado? Me neither. 
Good buy 
cheap paper 
OK But No Savings. 
Decent paper grabs sometimes 
Too expensive 
Worth A Shot (and doesn't include gray) 
some work some don't 
Cheap but sticky. 
Do not purchase. 
Blazingly fast but not as user-friendly as the Fujitsu ScanSnap 
If I could figure out how to use it..... 
It Dispenses 
Compact but takes getting used to. 
Fine but not a significant improvement 
Prefer standard stickies 
Great in concept poor in execution 
Bottom adhesive is too far away from edge 
COULD BE STICKIER 
The Bottom tends to Fan Out 
Could use more or better-placed sticky 
Good concept but flawed 
Good idea just not executed well.... 
Not as cool as I thought 
Doesn't work as well as you'd think 
weak adhesive but hard to peel from the pad 
Not So Helpful Sticky Notes 
A bit too strong for regular sheets of paper 
Great for Papers Not so Good for Posting 
Nice but still needs some work 
Useful but needs more sticky 
not worth the premium in price 
A good old post-it but with a few quirks 
not quite 
If you need it - it might help but... 
LIKE my 3M Post-It Notes BETTER because they STAY FLAT ... 
Almost Lie Flat 
About as good as regular sticky notes 
The notes will curl up as soon as you take them from the pack. 
Hard to Use 
Apples to apples to sticky paper... 
cute but best for a gift 
A cute desk ornament but not for real frequent usage. 
Good but... 
Not worth the effort. 
Curling edges are a hassle but the price is right 
Pencil Sharpener a bit Small 
Decent pencil sharpener. 
Nothing Special 
Nice hand feel but lines could be cleaner. 
Looks nice feels cheap 
Okay not great not bad... 
Average 
Found myself looking for excuses to write 
Good not great 
This product doesn't age gracefully 
Half and half... 
It is a gel ink pen 
Didn't Work As Described 
A new development in book marking/note taking 
OK But Kind of Odd 
Handy all-in-one packet 
I'm Not Quite Sure What The Point Is 
Not as handy as you'd think 
Colorful! 
Rainbow of color and sizes 
Like the concept but they don't hold their \stick\ as well as Post-It Notes 
notes that stick 
EPSON R2000 / CANON PRO-10 / PRO-100 FACE OFF! 
Good overall function but no cross-shredding!!! 
Just your basic calculator 
Nice little calculator 
Easy to read numbers but just OK 
Decent 
Be Careful of the Clip 
Nice report cover but pricey 
Useful and unusual but not great. 
The clips are too hard 
Does the job but not likely for long 
Really good if keeping inside a briefcase 
Useful Design but Too Flimsy 
Decent product nothing special but it will do the job 
Useful Folders! 
Thin and to easy to bend 
Good but way too delicate. 
Great results for a low price if you can wait for the ink to dry 
It's fine but only for specific uses 
Effective enough. 
A relic from the 1960s? 
Works fine 
It works but limited usefulness 
Not so sure... 
Sharp but not as safe as others 
Safety Over Functionality 
Safer maybe but not easier 
Safe but not as effective as a utility knife or sturdy scissors... 
Works great on thin plastics terrible on durable blister packs 
Time will tell 
Where was this when my kids were little? 
Pretty cool tool... 
OK for Small Jobs 
poor version of a box cutter 
Too Lightweight 
Needs a bigger blade. 
So-so 
Almost Better Than a Razor Blade 
Ooh a Box Cutter 
Pretty good for the price 
Quality label but not the normal ease of use that I am used to with Avery. 
Labels are good Avery templates so-so 
Cuts well but exposed cutting edge could slice little fingers 
Decent printer quirky. 
Too Bulky 
Attractive yes but a bit awkward 
Cute by not easy to load 
Design is superb but removes functionality. 
Colors off on photo printing 
So far so good but... 
not good for art pencils 
Stylish pretty comfortable with some reservations 
HON Abandons Quality 
not so impressed.. it's okay 
Elegant look...  disappointing features 
Looks Great But Lacks Quality 
thin padding and oddly proportioned 
Make sure this is what you want before you get it 
Sleek and firm but it is not leather. 
Would be much better on casters 
Good phone but dated design 
Expensive and not that great 
Better than the tab markers 
not what i thought 
Works well but will drain your wallet with ink costs 
Does everything really well but the ink use is highway robbery 
Scanner died within months 
Not overly impressed but they work for my purposes 
colors are off 
Not what I expected. 
Works As Described but Not Reusable or Permanent 
Easy to Use 
Product is so-so design and print online service is great 
Read the small print... Tips for use & a couple recommendations that work better for you 
Not as expected 
It's a basic label sheet with adhesive back/border 
Nice looking little signs but don't print to edge on all printers 
Would like to see bigger shelf tags 
my fault 
A good little copier/printer with one hesitation 
Great for pictures but not the printer to use for routine office work 
This printer is a bad mamma jamma! 
Good fast prints not so good interface 
Couldn't Get It To Work On My Network 
Not bad but has design flaws. 
The software drives me crazy 
Quiet Fast All-in -One 
Be Careful Mac Users 
Great quality and easy to use! 
Do you copy? 
A bit too big for an inkjet machine 
Great printer! - UPDATED 3 YEARS LATER - LEAKS INK 
Look great alignment is problematic 
Okay hard at first 
Something like greeting cards meet stickers 
good labels but templates may be an issue for some people 
Okay but.... 
Avery 
nice labels but templates only work with Microsoft Word 
Some tricks to using... 
Product itself is great but creating labels can be a challenge 
Great idea challenging to produce 
Ok not great. 
sort of flimsy 
Not as easy as I thought it would be to use 
About what I expected 
Can be a challenge to attach labels to bags 
Fantastic for small food businesses bake sales and avid cooks 
Prints nicely but has some limitations 
Not impressed 
Anticipation.... 
Great labels but awful Mac software support 
Templates Need Work 
Good Product Needs Better Templates 
Round stickers are brown 
Decent Lables But Nothing Special 
Another Good Avery Product But Could Be Improved On 
Nice albeit small arched and textured labels but the template support could be better 
A decent all-in-one for the home office 
Epson WorkForce 845 Wireless Color Printer 
A firmware update improved this printer.  :-) 
Nice not great. 
Just An Ok Printer. You Wont Be Impressed 
Glaring problems prevent the Epson 645 from being recommended 
Epson WorkForce 645 Wireless Printer with Scanner Copier and Fax (C11CB86201) 
Thirsty as a sailor on shore leave slower than molasses in January 
The price clinches it for me 
Not a bad inkjet printer but don't believe the high print volume hype. 
Hits the basics but I expected more 
Excellent Quality Fast Printing - UPDATED 
No bad but not great 
So many features so many options... maybe too many & printing subpar 
Easy labels iffy fonts 
Lots of features Still not a P-Touch 
Nice product but no thanks on the expense 
Better than Brother PT1290 
A good labeler but not great. 
OK 
More complex isn't always better 
Efficient but the UI could use some work.. 
Works well enough 
Decent label maker; when it is working 
Fine for a Presentation BUT Not Particularly Durable & NO VELCRO 
Protection of documents on travel 
Flimsy Like The Paper You Put In; No Velcro 
Nice for Documents But Not Very Sturdy 
Pretty flimsy 
Decent product but should come reinforced in some areas. 
Adequate 
Definitely not for heavy duty use 
They're Just Okay 
Great option for the price. 
Decent but with one very annoying quirk 
Works fine but not competitive with the best alternatives 
Inexpensive 2-in-1 presenter & mouse. 
Nice pointer but poor-quality software. 
Good range with a lot of design problems 
Good pointer and remote; annoying design flaws 
Better options out there 
The Dongle broke within a few days. 
It does the job as it is advertized 
The Cadillac of label makers - DIED - see Edit 
Least favorite of all my label makers. 
Ultimate label maker but battery is the biggest Con 
Not significantly better than the non touch version 
Great Labeler... Questionable Power Supply! 
Have all the good qualities except quantity and price. 
Runs Out Too Fast 
Good workhorse and easy on the budget 
Well it Prints. 
Value priced laser printing but not for macs 
A good value 
A good budget laser printer

Mystery Kit 
Thin/Flimsy But Acceptable 
Standard Manila files 
Helpful but not unusual 
It's just what it looks like - 9 regular file folders and a sheet of blank labels 
Eight dollars for nine file folders? 
It's OK 
You are paying for the look not the quantity. 
Really?  It's simply a marketing ploy save your hard earned dollars. 
The glass is either half-empty or half-full depending on your perspective. 
Too much money for 9 colored file folders 16 stickers and a sheet of helpful tips for life 
Very basic kit 
What I needed 
Should Have Included More of Everything 
Sturdy great label area 
Smead MO Filing Starter Kit... MO = my organizer 
Good for basic file keeping

Just order a box of folders instead 
I like these just fine. They're file folders plain and simple (though really overpriced). 
'Starter' is indeed what it is. 
Nothing special... 
Nine folders labels tips 
Better than your everyday standard file folder! 
GOOD PROS BUT CONS AS WELL 
Good Organizer does not stand up on its own 
Inexpensive light weight 12 pocket organizer. 
Good product but an organizer is only as organized as its owner 
Clear window broke within a week 
Neat folder not exceptional 
Well designed could be better a bit expensive. 
Not For Me 
insanely bright blue instead of navy as pictured but otherwise an okay folder 
Nothing Special

Useful folder to have 
great for trainings or conferences however...

Not as practical as I thought it was going to be! 
Way Too Pricey 
Solid box for filing and storage 
Limited usefulness and inconsistent results... 
Nice idea but doesn't work as well as it should. 
Cute little gadget 
Great design idea less effective practical tool 
Sometimes Works Great Others Frustrating 
Overall nice...but not quite what I expected 
It's ok 
Definitely a uni-tasker but does its job well 
New Westcott Scissors Mouse Is Useful !! 
Not for lightweight paper 
Bit of a learning curve on this one! 
Works great - when it works 
Not everything it seems 
Made for cutting paper...not papers 
Good idea but not that useful for me 
Great concept but too hard to learn 
Best For The Kids 
Works Under Some Conditions 
Takes some getting used to 
Great idea but be careful 
It works but you have to know how to use it 
Good for only a small subset of what plain ol' scissors can do 
A product that works but is not as convenient as scissors 
Cuts well but (perhaps) limited use 
Its good but does add bulk to your wallet 
Average product 
Not much \higher\ capacity 
Nice printer not completely wireless 
A powerful shredder with some annoying flaws

Good concept some flaws 
The Good. The Bad. The Stinky. 
Curled up on edges 
Could be better 
Great Idea. Disappointing Product. 
OK but Kind of Gimicky 
A little disappointing 
Handy 
Nice but not necessarily necessary 
Good concept but falls short 
Love the idea--but it's got limitations! 
does what you expect but $5 seems very expensive for what you get 
Easy Convenient with Cautions 
Eye-catching but does not stick to all surfaces 
Would be better if it were white 
Not my favorite Post-it product 
Nothing Special... 
IMHO...Meh! 
Not quite perfect 
Windows Only Alternative To Fujitsu S1300i 
Some minor inconveniences but still a decent scanner 
Not Quite Ready For Primetime 
An interesting alternative to the Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300i 
Looks nice so-so quality 
Quality is fine but the black border really cuts down on the usable space and the picture is misleading. 
Don't expect 
Love it 
Arrived warped 
DON'T TRUST THE PICTURE.  Usable cork surface only about 13\ x 8\ 
Too Small 
This a nice lightweight cork board that is in a convenient ... 
Too small to be functional 
smaller than advertised 
Looks nice but large frame makes it less functional 
Smaller than you probably want 
Great as a Memory Board! 
Frame is larger than it appears in the picture 
Stylish stapler but not the usual swingline quality 
Cheap 
Functional Stapler 
fun color but definitely only good for the occasional user 
Waste of money 
Works fine but not ideal for a frequent stapler. 
Functional light weight stapler for personal use - BUT! no starter staples included 
A fine light duty inexpensive stapler (if you don't pay list price). 
Not sturdy but stands out 
Not that impressed 
Not Your Grandma's Swingline 
It's okay looks good feels flimsy 
Decent compact stapler 
Very Dissapointing 
Reasonably Good 
Ok for a small printer I still prefer Epson's WorkForce brand 
Can be realllllly slow 
Pretty good 
A very basic multi-function printer. 
It's an Epson. If you like them you'll like this one.

Good for Small Scale Raffles Hard to Design 
Too Reliant On MS Word 
Good Product but Program Issues Hurt It 
OK but......... 
I don't trust them - the chips don't work. 
ink loves to bleed even with fast writing. 
Not overly impressed 
Comfortable pen but drags on paper 
Nothing to Write Home About 
Dark & Mysterious Colors Poor Ink Coverage 
Really neat! But really these are pens! 
Works OK but definitely not worth spending $16+! 
Rainbows 
Uni-ball pen set - disappointed by the colors 
It's Okay - Not My Ideal 
OK for minimal shredding volume 
BASIC PAPER CLIPS 
If You've Used a Comb Punch & Binder Before Great! If Not You Might Want to Start With a Different Machine 
Works OK but definite areas for improvement 
bulky and not compatible with iphone and iPad 
Price blows avery out of the water but watch out for printer compatibility 
Not great using Lion on the Mac - Large Footprint 
Newer but not a V700 replacement

Nice all in one but slow and uses ink like crazy 
Good Quality \Disposable Printer\ ... 
It doesn't work on my network nice scanning claims about touch and cost 
Nice printer flawed scan capabilities expensive ink 
Works great on the network BUT... 
Printer's great; scanner not so much 
Runs out of black ink way too fast 
THIS THING IS MADE TO WASTE INK!! 
EXTREMELY user friendly interface but not perfect 
It's decent but not sure of value for price... 
Could Not Connect to WiFi 
There is better for the same cost. 
Overall pretty good printer with a few quirks

Slow!! 
Ink is very costly 
Does a lot of stuff

Works well 
It's OK 
Looks good but not the life-changing object they claim 
Interesting But  . . . 
Odd Chair ... Mixed Results ... 
Quirky chair 
Cute and easy to assemble 
Comfortable and stable. 
As advertised and easy to put together with one problematic design flaw 
Meh 
More expensive reliable 
This is not the photo black cartridge plus it's an okay price. 
How Am I Using Ink This Fast!?!? 
Like I have a lot of choices... 
It runs out quickly. 
Not seller's fault but............ 
Great Printer - Not Best Choice for Vellum - Disappointed w/Canon

Reliable product at a good Price but not the best. 
Sturdy and functional but not perfect 
A Few Improvements Over Its Predecessor (The MA220MB) But Not As Aesthetically Appealing And Has Durability Issues 
Good quality but \easy adjust\ is a bit of a stretch 
Very very well made...but get the other one 
It's a good idea 
Interesting organizing concept - good paper from a well-known company 
Useful but not incredibly convenient 
It's okay 
Better than I expected 
Grossly overpriced 
Not sure of the advantage 
Amazing But Expensive 
Good idea poor execution 
Quality just OK nice idea but .... 
Works a little too well paper is very thin 
You are paying for convenience 
More of a pad of paper than a clipboard 
A regular old clipboard is much better 
Interesting Idea With Flaws 
Just OK 
They are not Cannon ink. They are not bad though and they are soooo cheap! 
So - So Price is Right 
They're pens... 
Pilot Work Force Retractable Pen 
Large sturdy pen 
It's okay. Kind of a novelty thing. 
Just a little too big... 
Not impressed - cheap feel ugly clip slippery grip 
OK 
OK pen in terms of function 
Good if this is your kind of pen expensive if it isn't 
Not sure how practical this is 
Pen works 
Good pen but design could be better 
Clunky 
So Close but Not Quite 
It doesn't live  up to the claim 
the colors aren't particularly bright or vibrant 
OK But I Would Prefer a Softer Grip! 
more water resistant than Pilot G2 but writes less smoothly 
Just okay 
Not as smooth as I'd hope. 
Flimsy and easily bent 
Large and Economic 
Works OK but maybe not enough ink? 
Good printer no wifi built-in and expensive toner 
It's Okay 
Several things draw the rating down here... 
Positive first impression so far but \return imaging unit\ a little worrisome 
Not as many features as the competition but still a solid basic printer 
Very good not great 
110 negatives. 
VERY easy method to convert your old photos to digital 
Average Stapler in Pretty Wrapping. 
Nice appearance works fine. 
Attractive 
Looks good but doesn't staple any better 
Decent Sharpener Need to Wiggle You Pencil a Bit to Sharpen All 
A portable and efficient pencil sharpener but some flaws 
Does as promised 
Might Have a Dud-Keep Receipt for 10 yr. Warranty 
Works pretty well 
Made In China - Poorly 
Nice but with some annoying flaws 
No AirPrint 
Good Choice if You Don't Have to Have Color 
Still not Laser 
Won't Replace my laser printer but makes a great standard printer 
Good printer but 
Is this REALLY an affordable alternative to a laser printer? 
The tray sucks but it prints nice 
Good quality photos but a monochrome laser might be more suitable if you print mostly text. 
For the price good value but lacks the bells and whistle. 
Good printer but please Epson make OSX installation easy 
Monochrome Printer with a HUGE Ink Cartridge 
There are better Epson products 
Compact single-purpose black ink inkjet printer 
Fine but nothing special 
Can't Get the Wi-Fi Working 
Am I missing an important point? 
I'm not sure what these are for I thought they were binders for letters. 
Just plastic sheets 
Just plain 8 1/2 x 11 (7mil) Polyethylene (PET) sheets. 
Pictures can be deceiving&#8230; but still a great plastic cover for your docs 
pictures are misleading 
Not entirely as advertised 
Not Bad 
Easy to use . . . 
Sharpens great but you're going to have to hold it down 
Ok 
Works OK for a portable 
I am on the fence - It does work 
Compact Size with a few problems 
Westcott iPoint Ball Pencil Sharpener (15570) 
It works 
Interesting product...plenty of uses just don't use too many 
Interesting Novelty but Expensive 
Its big in size but not on stick 
Good for limited use; not sticky enough. 
OK not sure there's any practical use for this product 
Great product that I've been finding a ton of uses for but the adhesive isn't quite strong enough. 
Great except for one thing 
Be Sure you Need Only Single Function! Choose carefully. 
Bend Over When Buying Ink 
Paper get Messed Up 
SLOW not always user-friendly one-trick pony w pricey consumables per unit print costs 
Good product recommended for photo printing very slow. 
Excellent prints but Set-up was frustrating for me 
Lot of plastic pricey (Canon only) ink noisy and limited features 
Op System Problems. 
Not Vanilla Manila 
A nice idea to help you relabel and reuse manila folders needs improvement 
Well... 
Read the small print 
can only use specific pens and erasers 
Great idea 
Not so erasable... 
For the environmentally conscious - reuse reuse reuse 
Very easy set up quite handy for documents image quality lacking compared to other scanners on photographs however. 
Comparison of the P-208 with the Cannon P-215 
It doesn't fare well when compared to my Doxie GO personal scanner... 
Great Quality (But Expensive) 
great tape at a really high price but some care can help 
Odd \Tape\ 
Not as good as competing products 
cool red tape for packing or marking things red. 
Works ok 
Watch where you stick it! 
mainly good for resealing easy opening and closing 
Decent deterrent if you apply more tape over the top of it 
Most of the Manufacturer claims for this security tape for lightweight envelopes and mailers tested true but one did not 
not for sealing 
Helps to supplement heavy duty long lasting packing tape 
With Reservations 
This message tape works best if used UNDER the clear thick packing tape. 
It would be ok if the description didn't say high adhesion and holding power 
Easy to Realign 
not very sticky 
Barely sticks to a box.  Not good for security or anything else. --- Edited and upgraded from 1 to 3 stars 
Alert tape for tampered package - not useful as a packaging tape 
Adhesive is too light for box sealing 
Okay but Could Use Some Improvement 
Barely adequate for intended purpose when used alone 
A little fragile 
Not as strong as expected. 
Good for warning not for sealing. 
Thin Box Sealing Tape 
Thin easily tangled tape 
Ok 
great for labeling but NOT for your primary tape 
Could be thicker 
Truly a Label Not a Sealer 
To Enhance Your Taping Not for Primary Taping 
Sticky 
Did I get a bad batch? 
Doesn't last long 
Could be much better 
Did Not Impress This Pen Snob 
Your Favorite Black Ink Pen With A Colored Squiggly Line Case 
Black pens 
Great picture quality but questionable security 
the mystery pooper remains at large 
Not the most sensible product. 
Great quality OK with my printer 
I wanted to like this more.... 
This product solves a problem that I don't have but if I did...

Neat idea

Noteworthy Note Taking 
Okay...Whatever 
Nice idea needs improvement 
Good idea buggy app 
Worked fine for me but not worth the cost. 
It is a note pad 
Does what I need it to do but there is no iPad app... 
It' ok.. 
Don't last too long 
Be careful when opening or ink will get on you 
Smead Organized UP Heavyweight File Folders: Things are looking UP 
Good... useful... but not as great as expected 
Good Concept Needs Some Changes 
Don't put them in a backpack! 
Very odd file folders... 
Nice images but missing something. 
decent printer but a real pain to set up 
good product for an ALL in ONE 
Some good; some bad 
my first disapointment from Canon 
Prints and scans well but won't print without a power cycle after it goes to sleep 
Great price you get what you pay for watch the wording of the product features they may lead you to wrong conclusions 
I was hoping for more. 
Good enough but I liked the MX 850 better 
Solid Printer with Good Features but Some Negatives 
Lift 'Em High 
Learning to leave a fingerprint 
Not what I thought it was from the picture 
Difficult to dispense works just fine 
Works fine in some cases 
Not as easy to use as flat sheets not sure why you would choose this instead. 
Great hardware 
Pen-o-holic's Perspective: Poor Man's Gelly Rolls (Almost) [3.5 Stars] 
Not as good as Sakura but some are ok 
3+ is more realistic 
Not the best 
So.... 
Okay Pens 
Every color you can think of. 
Rainbow on a stand patience required 
Nice set of gel pens often takes extended time for ink to dry. 
Perfectly good gel pens 
Great pen holder great color variety not that great pens 
The Price is Right. 
Everyday paper 
Nice white and bright 
Works OK in very dark room 
Panasonic Answering Machine will ONLY work with Land Line 
A Sharp(ie) Disappointment 
Dull Colors under room lights 
Not the best for art projects 
Good for black lights not sure about anything else 
Most colors were great - easy to use 
Useful for marking on white backgrounds 
These Are Okay 
neon but not opaque 
Not as bright as I hoped 
Arrived broken 
corners break easily 
Adequate 
For the price it's fine 
Good quality but not perfect 
Quartet Dry Erase Board (23 x 17) 
Good enough for a cheap price 
I've had better 
Good enough 
Adequate small magnetic erasable board 
Love the idea not the reality 
Disappointing but you get what you pay for. 
Nice idea but picture quality isn't great 
I was expecting more 
Left with a case of buyer's remorse 
OK - sharpener. Weak motor good warranty 
Decent unit for the home or small office... 
Great except for one thing 
Good for home use but not for office/school 
speakerphone is horrible 
No problem but its not like having built a better mousetrap. 
Comfy but no anti-slip coating on the bottom makes it slide around on your desk 
Didn't make life easier 
Decent wrist support not good for gaming 
Looks cheap makes a LOT of noise when you slide the mouse 
Wrist support is fine but the scraping noise is annoying! 
Too Slippery For My Tastes 
Some may like it 
Product Didn't Meet Expectations Because My Use Was Not Right 
Good mouse pad. Less good wrist rest. 
It feels wierd 
Works but kind of ugly 
Ok mouse pad 
Good but not great 
Wrist Rocker 
Fellowes wrist rocker 
Not that special... 
Not for all users 
Okay but needs exact table ergonomics to work right. 
A plastic sheet 
A bit of buyer's remorse... 
Mediocre Laser Printer from Canon. 
A useful (but slow) color laser printer - that would make a decent printing scanning and copying tool for small or home offices 
Couldn't get any dry  marker to work legibly on the shiny calendar surface area 
Cheap construction and sub par marker. 
Mid-level quality of construction 
Good Board 
Good Basic Laminator (But You Better Know How To Use It!) 
Okay not great 
Is this worth the price? 
Good tape but nothing special 
Works just fine but not enough to justify the cost 
Easy to work with. 
Strong tape. Overkill for most jobs. 
OK Quality but PRICEY 
Use Sparingly It's Expensive But Good 
Seems good rather expensive 
Good Tape But Expensive 
Yowza that price! 
Pretty generic 
Decent Product ... 
Tape without dispenser 
Disappointing.  I'll stick with the Scotch or Duck.  They are both better values. 
Thicker and stronger but also a bit more expensive than average packing tapes 
Good but not great 
Nice tape but I see no reason for the high price premium. 
Spine quick to insert... but quick to fall out too. 
Spine Is Easy To Put In But Easy To Fall Out Too 
List price is extremely high costs less here 
Good product but a little pricey 
binders 
Fine But Pricey 
Just an ordinary binder 
Ok binders but I did not find the spine much better than any other 
Decent average binders 
Amazon Basics Thermal Laminating Pouches 
Works Good...But Not For Me 
Not very practical 
Practical & Hefty  but a little pricey 
Could be better 
This \lift\ should only be used as a \laptop riser stand\ with an external keyboard - never type with your wrists pivoted upward 
Great Idea Cool Design But Angle is Not Adjustable 
Watch your angle 
Awkward to use for my laptop. 
Didn't work for us at first 
Lift and tilt your laptop PC a simple yet pricey gadget 
Just so so 
It's Okay But Not Really  Helpful for Me. 
Would be perfect if the resting angle was adjustable 
Totally under-whelmed 
just OK 
Good height but flimsy 
useful stand - some limitations 
Somewhat wobbly... 
Ok but not outstanding monitor stand. 
My monitor's base is too wide. 
In many ways ideal for my needs... 
Should be stronger and needs adjustability 
Check the width of your monitor's base first 
so far it is good 
Cheap to buy - expensive to use 
Cheap price small footprint & good prints/scans but no Fax/Ethernet & costly ink makes XP-410 a dubious choice for many users 
There are better Epson options to choose from 
Slick Economic Printer 
Decent printer sucks up the ink 
Minimal but with a small footprint 
Versatile printer with a very good scanner 
Great Printer But So Far That's All It Does 
Nice footprint nice look but loud! 
Workable for home shipping 
Pros and cons 
Okay for light-duty sharpening. 
Makes pencils less dull 
Average Sharpener 
Meh. 
Start sharpening in the morning for an afternoon meeting - Ok it's not that bad 
Novelty Sharpening 
Nice USB feature but spend a bit more on something commercial. 
Works ok for sharpening an already sharpened pencil 
Works fairly well 
Satisfactory 
Cheaply made. Works but required fixing first. 
Sadly not for Prismacolors. Not very green. 
Meh...There Are Better Choices 
Convenient but not much power... not expecting it to last long 
A BIT UNDERPOWERED FOR EFFICIENT USE 
No Batteries Needed 
Pricey compared to more capable laminators 
Meh... 
3.5 stars 
Not All That Useful 
Didn't feel as comfortable using it as had expected 
Helpful pad but lacks some key features 
It's ok 
Could Be a Little Better 
Just ok 
Things To Do is ok 
A handy to-do pad for your desk or counter but not refillable 
Heavy smooth paper in disposable cover 
Nice Pad Could be Better 
It's Okay Large Line Space Large Footprint 
Better notepads available 
Simply OK 
Memo pad; hard cover is not useful on the one I received. Does not support pad up at an angle. 
Just a regular notepad! 
Wish it was smaller and that the stand was sturdier. 
A promising product but it's not quite there yet. 
It's alright for a notepad but there are some flaws 
Nice To-Do List Pad 
\Snap your move\ 
Not all features work consistently. 
Problems Putting it Together But Seemingly Ok Once Assembled 
One door warped; Apparent (slight!) water damage on the top surface. 
Big! 
Huge binder easy access pretty cover somewhat sturdy 
In which I sound like a grouchy old man. 
INSANELY Big!!! 
Design Could Be Improved 
Huge Binder Durability Questionable 
Large ... holds just about anything ... not sure it will last an entire school year 
Kind of flimsy but good size 
Really well designed but not perfect. 
Rugged But Also Bulky and Oddly Laid Out 
Good for an adult but not a child 
Great but needs more compartments. 
Bends easily 
nice storage features too wide 
Little bit too bulky 
decent for price 
a little underwhelmed 
Average binder 
Nice Features but Unattractive Bubbling 
basic sturdy a little pricey 
Not 4 pockets expensive easy to open 
Average binder 
Great For Kids Nice Bold Color Average- Quality... 
Good binder but wow it's expensive!! 
Good Features But Also Disappointing 
easy to open 
Not very heavy duty but rings are very good 
binder 
Nothing wondrous nothing abysmal 
Mine came ripped 
Edges are weak. 
love the pink 
No frills other than the vibrant color 
ok binder stiff rings 
Not really \heavy duty\ but okay 
Adequate 
Expensive for an average binder 
Not sure how Heavy Duty this is. 
ok but pricey 
great color 
Generic Binder Good Hinge 
Basic \no frills\ binder. 
Mediocre Quality 
Nice binder but could be more strong! 
Middle Of The Road 
Read the Fine Print 
Sturdy binder but flaw on sample 
Just Okay 
Ten bucks? It might be worth three. 
Functional binder but not as strong as another similar binder I have 
Decent binder but really nothing stellar - feels cheap and plastic cover already bubbling off cardboard 
These things have been too cheap for years. 
Not Terrible But Not Worth a Premium Price Tag 
It's...a binder 
Okay But Costly and Not as Reinforced as Expected 
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link 
High Cost Low Quality 
Solid Binder 
As good as any store brand binder 
Durable = quality? 
Serviceable but NOT Heavy Duty! 
Okay Binder  for School Children - Not for 'Client Use' 
Okay but looks and feels cheaply made 
edges are more durable 
Overpriced 
It's good but... 
Already Cracked but Holding Up 
Great for kids learning to write but only one piece of lead? 
Mixed Review 
USE ALOT OF PRESSURE WITH NO BREAKAGE!!! 
Nice if you tend to break leads 
good for what they are for 
Nice solid lead but pencil is hard and uncomfortable to hold 
These perform well and look nice... a good alternative to regular pencils 
I wanted to love them but... 
Good nor great machine 
Barebones I think 
Heavy Weight Physically But Light Weight Performer 
Monster size great for lots of office printing 
Falls apart too quickly 
Great for home files not so great for school. 
Nice but a little awkward.... 
BIG! and wide and deep 
nice but too big for school 
Sturdy 
It's huge and has a lot of single stitch spots 
Misses the Mark A Bit For Students 
Good Not Great Boxes 
Pretty good but I prefer Bankers Box brand 
Not high-end but decent 
Sturdy not self sealing includes side legend 
It's a box 
Smaller than the picture shows. $2.60 per box. 
A good size for some items 
Good quality and the biggest box you would probably want. 
Affordable no frills boxes 
Good if you need 20 
Okay I like other styles better. 
Nada the green plastic mount was off putting 
Solid cute trendy... but not worth the price for what you get! 
You can't write on it with artist pens (or pencil for that matter) 
Fun But Sort of Chintzy 
Fun product but pretty pricey 
Nice colors 
Not exactly washi tape 
Scotch Expressions Magic Tape 
Great for paper. 
Creative. 
Expensive colored Scotch tape 
Can't write on it.... 
A crafty twist on Scotch tape 
Great Look but Scratches Easily and Moderately Functional 
Good for books in lockers without crossbars; limited appeal otherwise. 
Good enough for an extra shelf..... 
Functional locker pocket 
pockets are pretty tight 
Major Fail 
a bit tall 
Not as cool as I thought it'd be... 
whole day isn't covered 
Inexpensive. 
Thin Cork Board 
It's just... ok 
Good quality dense cork board for reminders cards and photos for your office; mounting could be improved! 
Thin but sturdy 
Good price... but very cheap cork and poor packaging. 
Pretty much what it looks like.  Not bad for the price. 
Functional But Flimsy 
Pretty Cut & Dry 
With A Few Adjustments This Calendar Would Be Perfect 
Permanent mount smashed corners marker too big 
Comes with magnets but is not magnetic 
Flimsy and hard to erase 
Works ok pen is hard to erase after 2 weeks 
Bare bone but functional 
A large dry-erasable wall calendar that would work fine for both families and small offices 
Average Product 
it's OK... 
looks nice feels very flimsy 
Cute but mine fell down and busted after a few days 
Decent enough little board. 
Sort of flimsy but adequate when placed on a level surface. 
hangs with adhesive pads only 
Light weight item 
Large 
No chalk... 
Good looking but not heavy enough 
It's ok for the price 
A little disappointed. 
Inexpensive chalkboard but low quality 
Consider the actual writing surface size. 
Sturdy but very small writing surface 
Smaller than you think 
Small but still functional. 
Looks nice less filling 
Headaches on setup but the nice prints are worth the effort. 
A Tale of Two Printers 
Not heavy duty 
This Binder is great for occasional use did not find it to be heavy duty 3 ring binder. 
For a binder it's a darn fine product. 
These binders are fine but I certainly would not call them \heavy duty\. 
Not what I would call Heavy Duty 
Wilson Jones 363 Heavy Duty Round Ring View Binder 
Only for light or occasional use 
meh 
Wireless Issues 
Connected easily mediocre print quality 
Solid Nice Looking Small 
Small and thin but good for tight places. 
Great Concept poor execution 
Quality Product but Odd Value 
Not sure on home use of this 
Probably better for office use than home use 
Works for me 
OK for occasional use clean it constantly 
A heavy duty laminator that gives me pause 
Solid but cheap coloring. Corner punch/cutting doesn't work. 
Some parts great some parts not 
Teensy Items 
Low on Variety High on Distraction 
High Price for Convenience 
Buy it for reduced resistance when mousing 
Good for light duty work 
Decent value for the money 
Entry Level 
Lots of features but will it last? 
Works but only average print quality at best; an ok budget printer and scanner 
Small printer than print scan copy and fax BUT not the best quality print. 
Decent all around printer but for just a little more you can get the excellent Brother MFC-J870DW 
Mine's going back! 
Fine Pen and Stylus 
Presto Chango 
It's OK ... 
Good pen soft stylus tip 
Less clutter next to my chair 
Better pen than stylus 
As a stylus it's great but as a pen the ink flow is variable 
I'm going to stick with this prehensile thumb deal... 
Works as advertised 
Writes well but not comfortable to write with for any length of time.  Good for the stylus 
Decent combination item but a little high-priced 
Ball point with \squishy\ stylus 
Zebra shoots and sorta scores 
Not for Me But Maybe for You 
Sleek but a hassle to set up 
Not perfect but easy to use and sleek. EATS ink. 
PHOTOS are a Pain 
Light Duty Only 
Scans fast and wirelessly but unnecessarily complicated software installation and substandard TWAIN driver 
Easy Portability; Adequate Scans 
SO FAR CANT GET IT SET UP 
Oh Brother... 
\Laughter and tears... 
Not the scanner of choice (yet) due to urgent software matter 
Probably 4 Stars For PC 
Needs help 
A cheaper (but slower) alternative to the ScanSnap 
not as good as a Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500 for a Mac user 
Nice portable document scanner 
Not for me! 
Get's the job done. 
Good for on-the-go scanners but not for big jobs 
Software could be better 
It works it's handy 
If price is your primary concern then this scanner may be for you. 
If clouds had scanners... 
Too Big 
Easy setup as a network printer but slow and expensive for a multi-function printer. OK for photo printing. 
Epson XP-950 vs Canon Pixma Pro-100 vs Canon iP4000 
Great for photos but not quite as a day to day printer 
sleek printer but not good at printing blacks 
Larger footprint but prints 11x17 
Limited amount of reasons to buy this printer 
frustratingly beautiful 
OK photo printer but I think it is not the leader of the pack 
Fair Printer 
Good Student/Casual User Printer 
Great little inexpensive printer with quality results 
Compact Unit Slightly More Limited Features 
Good Printer for Occasional Use 
Okay but not worth the hefty pricetag 
Excellent Ink 
Very decent but the XP-850 is better 
Good for a home office with great features for Mac users. 
Very good but some issues 
Disappointed 
A vast improvement 
mixed bag 
Pilot mr animal pen 
awkward design for what could have been a good pen 
Writes great but has other issues 
Affordable Bauble I Mean Pen 
Heavy thick pen nice ink 
Hefty feel hefty tag 
Adequate but not special. 
Why the animals? 
Not as smooth as the Pilot Axiom Ballpoint 
Ricoh Multifunction Laser Printer 
No WI-FI but good color scanner good printing. 
Good printer 
Decent board dried out pen highish price for quality 
Pretty good deal at this price..... 
pen is very poor board is fine 
Notes to Self 
The best thing about this whiteboard is that is is narrow and will fit in smaller spots. 
Just O.K. 
Not a bad printer but not a good choice 
Works but has jamming issues and expensive toner 
Heavy somewhat confusing set up No Mac drivers 
broken? 
Value-priced ergonomic chair. 
For big people no lumbar adjustment 
Solid chair with a few drawbacks 
Could use stronger lower back support. 
Cute bit of bling but how long will it last? 
Not Exactly What I Thought 
Cute and will keep the guys from borrowing my stapler 
It's just ok 
bling stapler 
Nice Swingline Stapler But I Don't Know About The Bling 
Good 
Bling out the stapler 
A fine inexpensive stapler. The bling feature is silly. 
okay stapler with bling 
cute 
Decent enough 
Good basic stapler with customization! 
Swingline Bling Fashion Stapler 
Cheap light stapler no staples 
Not for the artistically challenged 
There are other options to consider before you buy 
A middle of the road shredder 
Confusing - manual says not to shred more than 10 sheets of paper in one pass and to remove staples/paperclips etc 
This is a good shredder for minimal shredding functions 
Less speed more grunt. 
Good for what it is intended for but don't take the 12 page rating too seriously 
Glides Easily But Not Good for Arthritic Hands 
OK I like it 
Good Board Bad Marker 
Usable but nothing special 
Would be better if a wall hook were included as a hanging option. 
Cheap and basic for a kid 
Functional Dry-Erase Board 
Inexpensive marker board good for small spaces 
Very cheap dry-erase board 
Nothing of note in any regard 
Just okay... 
Perfect Size For The Refrigerator 
Convenient but not quite out of the pack 
Good but not great 
Arrived Bent 
Cheap cheap materials and not the best choice out there... but it gets the job done. 
Duo Action: A Quartet Magnetic Combination Cork And Dry-Erase Board Review 
Works but I would not want to 'permanently' hang this on a wall! 
Handy to have ... 
Nice Magnetic List Maker 
Basic with not enough room for writing... 
Over priced for what it is. 
Works better than the Real Estate Freebies 
Handy. 
A Little Expensive Serves its Purpose ... 
Stays in Place! 
It's ok 
Very small sections to write in. 
Three Perforated Writing Blocks Per Page 
It's OK... 
Cute but not as functional as it could be. 
Good Idea But Needs Improvements 
Just ok 
Don't like it 
Well thought out design but could be better 
When you need one you need one 
Could use a stronger magnet 
Stronger magnets & fewer labels would be nice 
Decent For Small Lists Poor Design Not as Pictured... 
I don't like the perforations.  Magnets could be a little stronger. 
Not as tall as it appears... 
Held all I could put into it but easy to dislodge (magnet could be stronger) 
It's okay 
I know office products are pricey but...... 
Like it 
Very sizeable - unfortunately the magnet isn't very strong 
Quartet Magnetic Combination Board 11x14 
A Decent Board 
Its cute and functional but the magnets are really weak. 
Decent whiteboard but better are available 
OK for seven bucks 
Cheaply made but does the job 
Acceptable combination board 
Simply Okay 
The board itself isn't bad but buy some different pens. 
Meh. 
Average Quality 
Weak magnets again 
Good idea not sure how well executed 
Not overly impressed. 
I Can't Recommend Using the Magnet Strips for Hanging It 
Quartet Magnetic Mail Organizer Storage Pouch Review 
Good magnet 
Just OK... 
It works but not too impressed 
open at the sides 
It Works 
Works but magnet requires a large surface area 
Works well but dull 
This Would Be Best for a Locker 
Okay. 
ink powders off these quickly 
Not horrible probably best suited for a tween/teen. 
Arrived mangled 
When Magnetic doesn't mean Magnetic 
Sharper looking than an ordinary white board but arrived with dents and a scratch 
Looks like stainless 
Its OKAAAY 
Requires a little more effort 
A flimsy but functional cork board 
Well yeah...it gets the job done and no more.... 
pretty flimsy product 
No wall hooks just tape - Hope you like it exactly where you put it. 
Flimsy Average Corkboard 
Mostly functional very unimpressive 
Functional but may not last the long run 
It's Okay 
Not bad 
\Not flashy...\ is right.  Just a sub to mediocre cork board 
Nice little bulletin board but self-stick hangers are PERMANENT! 
Basic thin plastic cork board. 
Works 
Just okay. Nothing fancy nothing horrible. 
Fine 
\Cheap\ yet Functional. BASIC. BASIC. BASIC. 
Good idea...But... 
You get what's advertised but it's a bit useless. 
Week starts with Monday 
A little small for a busy work schedule / office 
Great price not so great quality 
Letter-sized memo board 
Quartet Magnetic Dry-Erase Board 
Ok but not the best 
Weak Magnets 
Inexpensive and made that way 
What is there to say? 
You Get What You Pay For 
It is adequate 
Pretty cheap but usefeul 
Protrudes magnets too weak to stick to fridge. 
Easy Open Binders 
It's a binder 
Probably not worth any extra money just to open easily. 
Bound 
Good Design But Cheap Materials Make This Undesirable 
Nondescript Binder 
Not My Favorite View-Binder 
Average quality binder at a higher cost.... 
Good enough 
Nothing super special 
For an \ultra duty\ binder this is looking mighty average 
Standard Binder 
Adequate 1\ binder no more no less. 
Problems with the quality of workmanship; but materials are good 
Considering the price and the puffery I expected better. 
Just an ordinary binder 
Great file for professionals or students alike 
It is a good binder. 
Could be better: feels weak when full 
Nice Binder - Prefer The D Ring Model 
Arrived with bubbles under the cover and several dents almost rips on the back cover. 
I like this size binder for use in storing my Family Heritage Reserach. 
What&#8217;s now &#8220;ultra&#8221; used to be industry standard. 
Nice enough a binder 
It has wrinkles! 
OK Binder- needs some better features 
Design Good But Quality Lacking 
It works but it's not heavy duty and feels like it should cost about two bucks. 
It's a binder made of polypropylene and it holds papers 
Basic notebooks for manuals and reference materials 
Basic binder - good for storing documents 
Just OK. 
Slightly Nicer Than The \Basic\ Line But You Can Still Do Better 
Useful to file documents 
Plastic 
Overpriced but well made 
Overpriced 
Not worth double what I pay for other binders 
Acceptable 
It looks like it was left out in the rain 
The Binder will do the job as it is strong! 
Would have been a good binder but covered in bubbles on the front and back. 
It's a mixed bag 
Hinge was singed 
Not the best binder I've used but also not the worst 
Several minor flaws throughout make this a bad choice for students 
Wrinkled bubbly cover but nice strong hinge 
Not as \heavy duty\ as expected 
Waiting to see.... 
2.5 Stars For An Otherwise Praiseworthy Product. 
Unnecessarily Complicated 
Just Post-It Notes with Advertising for the Evernote App 
Smooth Finish 
Decent laminating pouches - nothing special 
Wrinkles a little too easily 
Thin but good 
Middle of the pack pouches 
Good quality laminating pouches though not the best value if you shop around 
Excellent Pouches For Preserving Sensitive Documents Great For The Classroom... 
They'll Do 
Works great if you have the laminator tool. 
I don't have a laminater. 
decent pouches not the best value but not bad 
Average-ish? 
OK for lightweight storage; a bit pricey; some issues with assembly and a solution 
Good for my purpose 
light duty storage boxes not cheap 
Heavy quality but disaasembles easily. 
A little too big 
Like This Larger Size.  Very Handy! 
Looks Nice and is Fairly functional 
High quality but the spaces aren't very useful 
A Somewhat Perplexing Device ... 
101 Uses for That Little Slot on Your Organizer... Okay 5. 
Why not make the memo holder fit regular post it pads? 
It's pretty 
OK but not THAT impressive 
Better Than Wooden 
Clunky 
Disappointed 
Spaces are too small 
nice boxes and lines... 
OK Magnetic Notepad 
A thin sheet of paper with magnets glued to the back... 
Wish it was a little bigger 
Tear each sheet in two 
So it's a to-do list 
Love MEAD but... 
Nice Idea But Not Much Space To Write 
It's okay 
Nice idea with average implementation. 
Great Product Idea Not So Great Execution 
Neat Liitle Book - No way to \Organize\ 
stylistic yet one wonders for what use this is really intended. Smaller than imagined yet ample space for countless accounts. 
Not what I expected 
Nothing unusual 
No Real Reason To Purchase 
Good idea -- but needs a little tweaking 
GOOD BUT COULD BE BETTER 
Helpful idea hampered by small font and light print. 
Cute but not really necessary -- a plain piece of paper works just as well 
If you live in a world of FIVE DAYS a week! 
Mead Organizher Reminder Center 
Classy look awkward usage. 
Memo Board 
Helpful! 
There are SEVEN days in a week 
Disappointing 
Keeps you organized though not fashion-friendly 
Really good concept; not as great execution. 
6x10 is really small when split in two halves 
Excellent Solution but.... 
Mead Organizher Write 'N Wipe Weekly Undated Dry-Erase Calendar 
Weekly Organizer 
Not a bad idea but not very useful 
Nice idea but it's a bit too small to be practical 
Magnetic 
No storage for included marker 
Not easy to clean 
Prone to sabotage 
Monthly Dry Erase Board 
Grear for short notes; too small for much organization 
Just Ok 
good and bad 
Flawed 
A Dry Erase Calendar 
Family calendar 
Not what I'm looking for 
What's the point? 
Great Hanging Organizer Calendar 
Okay... not the best solution though 
Still On the Fence 
Not exactly what I'd hoped 
A little too large 
Best Part is that it's Purple.... 
Either you need it or you don't 
Easy way to keep track of spending 
Too cheap. 
Probably fine if you start when your child enters preschool but \compartments\ are small 
Nice But Could Be Much Better 
Only for the most severe cases of scrapbook-a-phobia 
First-rate Lamp: But is it Worth the Cost? 
Tightly Wrapped Will Pack a Punch but Has a Short Range 
Barely OK but it does fit the Mini pretty well. 
Nice idea if you have a small apartment or just getting your move started 
Neat idea poor quality boxes 
Okay for a VERY Small Move 
Bankers Box SmoothMove Moving Kit 8 Small Boxes 6 Medium Boxes 4 Rolls Bubble Wrap 1 Roll Packing Tape and 1 Marker (7716301 
Buy it for the medium duty boxes not the extras 
Nice Boxes Not Enough Bubble Wrap. 
Mediocre performance 
Expensive decent quailty 
Perfect size for moving... but 200% more expensive for the *exact* same box at Lowes or Home Depot! 
A large box with medium strength cardboard 
OK No More 
Get The Medium Boxes Similar Size But Better Built 
The website you have to go to order skins is very slow 
Cute Concept Otherwise Nothing Special 
Unique but not reliable 
Not the fun I expected 
Pretty stapler but it only includes a single skin and is mostly made of plastic. Is not a full sized stapler. 
Basic Stapler Not Heavy Duty 
Does not staple 20 sheets custom skin gimmick is... gimmicky. 
A substandard stapler with a gimmick and a inflated price. 
Kinda cool but unnecessary 
Swingline Stapler With An Optional \Skin\ 
Good fashion stapler 
Decent light-duty stapler 
Less useful than I thought although may be just right for some 
Okay for the Price 
Pockets are great - other features are iffy 
Good idea but too flimsy to be all that useful and what's with the single-position tabs 
Loved the trio of inside pockets but two important features are lacking whether used at home or on the fly. 
I like the extra inside pockets 
Functional and sturdy but does not inspire confidence. 
It works but doesn't seem sturdy 
Works for Me 
Moshi Stanza Duo Stylus Pen 
A Little Pricey for What It Is 
Not bad - Wish it had a slightly slimmer barrel 
Useful and pretty 
Handy But Not Phenomenal 
Marker Caddy 
A little bigger than it appears 
Over Priced 
Kind of cheap. 
Nice to have but not necessarily most convenient 
Quartet Prestige 2 Marker Caddy 
Markers are great the rest... not so much 
Idea is better than execution 
Good markers decent eraser 
Good dry-erase markets bad eraser cheap holder 
Limitless Comfort &#8211; Ergonomic Laptop Desk 
Prints beautifully and I found it quite difficult to set up wirelessly. 
Mostly Good 
Could use a large price reduction 
Good printer for kids college students and back up 
Deal Killers: (1) MANUAL Duplex Scanning and (2) Paper Jams 
No Color Screen 
Wireless Setup Doesn't Work/Wired Works OK 
Excellent Photos: Difficult Setup & Multiple Features Make it Very Complex to Use 
Big Bulky and not a fan 
Not bad for the price 
Ok but there are better Canon Printers out there! 
Big and Bold but not Smart 
Difficult to set up 
Decent printer but you can do better 
Really ultra-fine points on these. 
Very specific usage - for very small writing 
Good but not great 
It may be tough and durable but I had a few issues with it 
Decent Binder; Nothing Extraordinary 
More suited for gentle use and archiving 
Only Time Will Tell 
Great quality and paper handling. Setup is a nightmare 
Will burn through a pile of docs but complicated to set up and use 
There were a lot of little strips to remove from the scanner that are applied so it can be shipped easily. You're instructed to 
Wired good. Wireless fail. 
Get the Fujitsu iX500 instead 
Fast 2-sided scans but super awkward setup 
It will do the job but \WorkForce\ = \Forces you to work\ 
Ok doesn't compare to a Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500 
Complicated Setup Scanning OK 
OK but with some concerns 
Wonderful Hardware Software issues. 
Very easy to assemble but for me at least it isn't comfortable 
Comfortable but best for a somewhat wider and lighter body overall 
Good chair meh on the price. 
Nice Easy-to-Assemble Chair 
Works well once it is set up 
Excellent networking/connectivity otherwise not that impressive at the price 
Wireless printer that works but at a cost. I prefer Epson WorkForce 630. 
Maybe Not  . . . . 
Not intuitive to set up 
Not quite the pen for me 
Pen and Pencil 
I am a pen snob. This passes... almost. 
Good idea but it's got some flaws... 
Nice product BUT.... 
Template issues 
I'd like these much better if I could download a template. 
Not as easy as you might think. 
3.5 stars - great labels less-than-perfect software. 
Love the look and functionality but not the limited features. 
Prints from anywhere!  Otherwise meh. 
Adequate 
Not as Good as HP Usually Is 
No template in MSWord or Wordperfect 
Fine for teens and adults 
Red is Dull Color 
Clear customizable cover????  Where? 
So-so Binder 
Not so durable. 
It's a binder 
Mead Binder 
WiFi and NFC wireless printing 
A rock solid label maker weakened by stupid design flaws 
Good label makeras label makers go 
Interesting design but I don't care for the rings inside 
Ninder Better Notebook Than Binder 
Is It A Notebook? Is It A Binder? Identity Crises. 
Five Star Flex Hybrid 1-inch NoteBinder 
flexible light but rings are a pain to open and close 
Arg! Same item as item #72186. Darn. It's just okay then. 
Probably won't last 
Too bulky for the smaller arms of school kids and not enough electronic compartments for older kids 
For A Low-Tech Reality 
shape is a bit odd as it could fit a ... 
Okay light one really poor functional flaw. 
Okay but I don't except it to have a long shelf \life\ 
Great for lockers not for other uses. 
Took me a long time to figure out where batteries went and hard to open. 
Adequate light if you can install the batteries 
Serves its purpose BUT . 
Serves Its Purpose 
Just OK 
Where Do The Batteries Go? 
Small: strictly for note taking 
Smaller than I thought 
Perfectly Normal Notebook 
I'm not sure what niche this fills 
A bit expensive in my opinion 
good quality but poor value 
Not quite a five-star value 
Average 
A giant high-quality all-in-one office printer ... with a few bugs. 
Problems at initial setup took a star away from an otherwise nice printer 
Grabs chunks of paper ... repeatedly 
Like other Workforce Printers: Suitable for small home office/ home school use but can become expensive 
With reservations 
Horrible Wi-Fi/Connectivity. 
Excellent Features Are Overcome by Glitchy Software Ghostly Printing 
Defective upon arrival -- waiting for replacement 
Suitable for small home office/ home school use but can become expensive in very heavy use 
Seemingly decent product but poor Amazon/Sentry Description & Documentation!
