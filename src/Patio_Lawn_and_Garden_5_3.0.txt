Fun and functional but a lot of work 
Close but no Cigar 
hmmm not the best hose in the world 
Not as happy as I thought I was going to be. 
It does what it was intended to do.... 
LIGHT IN UNIT WAS FAULTY......AND MORE DISAPPOINTMENTS! 
Not useful for mosquito control 
It's a great moth killer but... 
A good bug zapper but attracted a lot of moths 
Kills everything not sure if it reduces mosquitoes 
Effective but not completely; and it DOES CLOG (at first!) 
First bug zapper = DOA second one is bent but works 
EXPENSIVE AUDIO SATISFACTION OF MOSQUITO DEATH 
my own experience with this tool 
Corona Corona From Across the Sea 
It's a bit flimsy but gets the job done if you're careful 
Works but I will never use it again 
Not for people with 5 thumbs. 
Nothing To Brag About 
Good reel mower 
Flimsy 
It does the job but I might try something else next time. 
fair but not great 
Not sure 
Mice trip Kness Tip-Trap by walking ON it... flawed by design 
This is why the reviews aren't great 
A tiny gripe - why change what was working? 
Well made but very hard to clean 
I like this product 
Too big bulky and heavy for the hanging cord 
WORKS INEXPENSIVE NEEDS A HOOK ADDED TO HANG 
Expensive 
A Little work involved 
OK for what it is 
\one touch clean up\ - not quite 
REVERT BACK TO THE OLD WOOD HANDLES 
An honest review (UPDATE) 
Catches only the smallest rodents. 
Worked At First But Then Failed - a review of the \Tin Cat\ 
it's ok 
Better have some muscle.. 
The product works well enough but I saw it cheaper at a local store 
Nice for awhile 
There ok for small cuts 
you CAN get replacement blades; you'll need it 
it looks good though

Good But Needs Improvement 
Sturdy but could have more handy features 
Deters squirrels but has issues 
Perky Pet Squirrel be gone bird feeder 
Cost VS Practicality 
Better options exist but holds a lot of seed 
Yes It IS Squirrel Proof BUT... 
NO squirrel damage...but...NO BIRDS either 
Nice Feeder but Ridiculously Expensive 
Perch legs are too short 
Much bigger than I expected worried about how long it will last 
Attractive functional feeder - little birds love it 
Perky-Pet Squirrel be gone not really 
The Good and The Not So Good 
Good product but I can't justify the price 
large but seems a little flimsy 
Best for small seed not whole sunflower seeds 
Squirrel proof but birds don't seem to like it either! 
Looks good but not completely effective 
Made well but needs a 2.0 version 
Nuts to you!! 
Nice but the birds don't seem to like it! 
There's something about the design that birds don't like 
ok 
not for uneven yards or yards with rocks/roots - blade will get bent 
Got what i paid for. 
not useful 
Not sure if they work. 
Not particularly scary 
It works......... 
Works well but..... 
Not for short critters 
didn't  last 
Zapper screen is small in comparison to others on market

Not for the impatient multi-tasker. 
not large enough for my generator 
Flimsy but works.. 
So-so 
Okay For What It Is... 
Good for light duty task. 
Not for fall cleanup.... 
For blowing out garage and walkways 
Should have gotten a longer trimmer 
So hot! 
not professional quality 
Serves its purpose. 
Classic but not for me. 
So Far No Noticeable Positive Effects When Taken Internally 
Love these and the updates to new model but was damaged

Mixed Results 
Worked for some animals but not for others. 
Somewhat effective

No noticeable difference 
High Hopes

I thought it might work but didn't do much. 
Seems to work on rabbits but not on squirrels 
Not particularly effective 
Seems to be helping

Havahart battery powered repellent 
Maybe Another Season of Use Will Determine Effectiveness 
OK so far 
Somewhat works! 
It worked but not consistently 
Red squirrels didn't seem impressed.... 
Arrived damaged. Really damaged. 
Difficult delivery system 
Limited success with repellent (but nice sprayer) 
Sprayer didn't work 
Works well until it rains or you water the plants.  So you have to reapply often. 
OK

I don't know if it is good

Mixed Results. 
Perhaps not the most effective for larger acreage. 
I am so torn about this product after two months of use 
Works But Only for a Small Area 
Good in Theory Not as Good in Practice 
On the fence about this product...maybe an actual fence would work better! 
Problems out of the box 
Not Rocket Science 
Counterintuitive 
Wait And See 
Clever Solution to a Serious Problem 
Early returns are good.

Seems to work for now but can't be sure-Spray leaves visible residue 
Not Havahart's best 
Great If The Cup Was Not So Flimsy 
Easy to use 
Expensive and the cup arrived broken into several pieces 
Works But Hard To Spray 
Works in some instances but not around bird feeders...squirrels are addicted to those 'fast food meals'

OOPS! 
Perfect refill for heavy duty use

Requires some heft on new construction 
SO SO 
Itw okay 
According to the State of California these tools contain lead.

Work great but no size specified 
Not as advertised - deceptive claims 
Overpriced...but certainly usable... 
So-so bench that came with one broken piece and other damaged pieces 
Arrived broken 
Some Assembly Required 
Okay but not perfect 
Good fire pit. Not bad but not great either. 
Durable and attractive but poorly machined so the parts don't fit well. 
Don't leave it outdoors! 
Limited use but it might be right for you. 
Mixed review 
Nice features questionable efficacy 
Works if you use a lot 
Used around our birdfeeders

This is an effective formula will kill your moles in ...

Extra care is required when using 
Not sure if it works. 
Easy to use my dog was attracted to the area where I buried them.

Unsure 
Hard to tell if it works. 
Toxic gummy earthworms - seems to work but hard to be sure....

Seemed to work for a day or two

Non-toxic and doesn't stink haven't caught anything yet. 
This may work but.... 
Looks promising. 
Don't notice any difference

Works about as well as peanut butter. 
Nothing really wrong with the product

OK Not great.  Look for other possible alternatives 
Average seed 
Little more than an appetizer to our birds!  Hardly a success! 
It will blow over in high winds. 
Difficult to make straight edge. 
Mediocre

Large Capacity Feeder That Won't Leak -- Until You Remove It 
Great!  *May 17-Change in my rating...sad! 
An OK Product But I Prefer Planting Flowers To Attract Hummingbirds 
I prefer smaller feeders and here's why. . . . 
Not My Favorite Perky-Pet Hummingbird Feeder 
Toss away the nasty food. 
Hummers Avoid This One Most of the Time 
The Hummingbirds Give it a Five / I Give it a Three 
large on volume - fewer refills required 
Huge capacity but difficult to clean the base 
All setup and ready to go 
Not Great for Knotty Pieces 
Works but not for 4 months 
Time 
Only effective at close range and as a surprise for skunks 
Had hoped for more. 
Not bad 
eh?  so/so 
Fantastic for two seasons but no more 
Arrived bent but worked out OK 
Interesting concept

Works in \perfect\ soil but gets caught in anything else 
Haven't caught a gopher yet 
Hard to rate... 
Bird Feeder 
Not Really That Impressed And Could Be Dangerous For Birds 
Nice feeder but the squirrels win again 
Mediocre feeder 
Maryland birds weren't interested -- until I forced the issue 
Does Not Live Up To Its Name 
Squirrel-proof....and bird-proof too 
It's okay...but the look is clunky 
Looks nice but the birds won't use it 
Not Quite Ready For Prime Time 
A little on the cheap side 
Ok I guess but needed string to tie against side of pool 
It's okay 
Peat Pot 
UPDATE-Return IF 2nd hose just rec'd - see additional pictures. 
Works ok 
About what we thought on hindsight...

Good But Not Great In My Opinion 
No way will this hold 175 feet of 5/8\ hose 
Assembly a bit of a challenge 
Notes on assembly

Not so sure about this thing 
Only for very small mice. One-use only 
Expensive and Ineffective 
For the Squeamish a Clean Very Expensive Way to Catch Mice 
still waiting for it to catch something 
Not a better mousetrap... 
A reformed Kill & Seal guy (blame Coleridge's \Ancient Mariner\) 
Great Idea Not the Best Execution 
From a Germ-A-Phobe.... 
Clean and easy trap for squeamish but expensive 
It works sort of. 
REALLy cleam - but in a bad way 
Not As Gross 
They work but very limited on size 
Scorpion control results unproven 
Better than gas but not exactly a miracle 
Ideal for small yard urban dwellers - not ideal for suburban dwellers 
Nothing Fancy 
Its OK 
Quit working a little over a year later 
Could be Better 
Good but could be improved still 
Item was $63 two days ago 
Some good some bad 
Still have an ant problem 
It works sort of.... 
Good but still active. 
Powerful but lacks the ability to advance the line 
Performance 
Hand held snow thrower 
Go green 
Didn't work for me 
So so weed whacker.. 
Works well for a *very* short person. 
If you want a dandelion tool&#8230; this is it. 
Who knows if it works? 
Will attract a variety of birds to your yard but... 
Jury is out 
Depends on what you get 
So So 
Framework is good clamp fittings not so much 
Nice to Have But I Wouldn't Buy It 
Not worth the money 
supercalifragalistic squeegee 
Bust this out for the big jobs 
Not as good as expected 
Mona Lisa 
Works Good Most Of The Time 
Not What I'd Hoped For 
Complicating a simple chore 
Different Kind of Vac 
Gadget Tool or Toy 
Shiny streak free bathroom mirrors 
Not practical for small windows/ small panes. 
Works fine. 
Were a gift had to return 
haven't used yet will update review when i do. Seem durable but not thick as expected. 
Char-Broil Grill2Go ICE 
Intense Heat but burns through gas and not very portable 
Too Much Sprinkler For a Small Garden 
Decent killer 
Took a few applications to work 
A cardinal favorite albeit way overpriced (at $26.00)! 
No Finniel (Top) 
It probably kills slugs and snails 
mixed feelings 
Works but not as well as the competition 
Safer but higher priced Snail killer 
Slug and snail killer 
Slightly expensive but safer for pets! 
Slug killer on the loose! 
got item quickly but instructions horrible 
Still working 
Pretty Good Trimmer 
Good power but don't like having to buy expensive replacement blades 
Severely underpowered wobbly and noisy! 
Cute Stylish & Portable. Definite Eye Candy But Doesn't Function as Well as a Weber. 
Great Little Grill But Pricey 
Looks great well-constructed but smothers coals 
Good 
suction cup brackett is poorly made 
VERY NICE COLOR BUT 
Form -vs- Function 
8 inch self watering plant pot 
Hard to Handle 
works ok tough to figure out 
Water valve 
Not sure this cuts it for FL weeds... 
Works but is it worth the effort and ugliness? 
Doesn't prevent weeds but does reduce them 
It is working inconsistently 
Will Update Later 
Tire smell 
A Lite Weight 
Fairly good product 
Love the purple but... 
Not Impressed Yet 
Works ok maybe with a little open and  closing it'll work better 
Okay needs a modification 
Does the job. 
Light but akaward 
The teeth look a little grousome 
So far nothing. 
Certainly Nasty Looking 
easy to set but I haven't caught a rat yet 
Works but no dead rats yet.. 
Only Difference.......Price! 
Coshell COSAZ9 9-Pound Bag Coconut Shell Charcoal Briquettes 
Charcoal fine bag terrible 
Hot hot hot 
We Haven't Caught Anything Yet 
Often not \easy set\ difficult to bait 
Easy to set but handle too close for comfort 
Easy to set but hasn't caught a thing in a yard full of small animals 
Easy to set harder to adjust 
One Day I May Catch Something . . . . 
Works Great For Small Lawn. 
not so great 
Too expensive here but work nicely. 
Sharp Scissors but not much else 
Scissors on Steroids 
OK 
Its ok 
Why I don't buy Black & Decker products... 
Maybe there is a reason for the conflicting reviews 
Not as much control over frequency as my other timer 
Worked well for one season.  Sending it back for warranty. 
Great new tool to my pruning collection 
dont get too excited 
convenient but not crucial 
Better than rocks or broken pieces of clay but pricey! 
OK Idea but not really worth the money. 
Effective at raising the inner pot 
*** NOT AT THIS PRICE CHARLIE *** 
works but there are free alternatives 
Old gardeners have a hard time changing their flowers 
Only because I'm lazy 
Good but genius?? 
These discs work well but are they the BEST option? 
Okay for smaller bug catching duties 
Pretty but the birds are ignoring it... 
Three because I like the design but 
Looks nice and well constructed but hummingbirds are avoiding it 
Effective use with caution 
Basically tupperware with a hole for a mouse 
Motomco... 
Be careful if your cats eat mice 
Back to traps 
Works but there are better options for homeowners. 
Not sure if this works. Control vs. elimination? 
Takes a while. 
Good but could be soo much better 
Great product ... but NOT suitable for shipping. 
Hard to like when item not included. Quick to send after initial review. 
It get the job done 
Good Product But Why So Pricey? 
Does what it says it will but who cares? 
Really Works but Too Much $$ 
What do you have more money than brains? 
It is okay for what it is... 
An alternative pot filler 
Scotch Brite 
Good idea but product's advantages over rocks aren't enough to justify the price 
A comparative study 
Easy but unnecessary 
Not something I'd spend much money for 
A jumbled mess of cords. Terrible design. 
Okay product but not Dirt Devil quality 
Work good recommend you use outdoors but could be used indoors as well 
Good pest control for areas where traps aren't the best option 
Works great but caution is in order. 
Best for a garage shed or other pet-free enclosure. 
OK 
I haven't seen any dead mice around yet but ... 
Effective - though old fashioned snap traps are cheaper and safer. 
I like the clear top because it allows me to see ... 
Can they build a better mouse trap? 
Okay but not ideal 
Reading the warning limited uses in my opinion. 
Effective against mice but dangerous to pets 
Great design but bait didn't attract any mice 
Works but is dangerious. 
Danger to pets is a serious caution here 
Mice did chew on bait.  This version  is not pet resistant and the poison is lethal to dogs and cats. 
Works OK 
Great Product but too expensive 
It works and makes for the lightest possible pot 
Works but expensive hard to fit and you can do better yourself. 
nice but expensive 
So far so good but it's kind of early to tell 
Pot of Gold? 
Glorified Buffing Pad - Works but what's in it? 
Not As Great As I Had Expected 
It's essentially an oversized scour-pad 
Works well overpriced. 
Step  4 is somewhat confusing 
High Price Tag for a Nice Product 
Works but EXPENSIVE! 
There are cheaper alternatives 
These discs work well but are they the BEST option? 
Good for larger pots! 
Easy to set up less backache later but expensive 
Useful but free alternatives exist. 
Clever if overpriced 
Pot Filler?  or Giant Pot Scrubber 
No mess in Fall 
For this diameter the product should be thicker 
A Garden Genius? Hardly...  Good Idea- However Highly Flawed Design 
3 1/2 stars great idea and works but expensive at full price 
Help with a weighty problem. 
Good Drainage not good filler 
I'd like it thicker 
All alive but they don't stick around 
Bait 
Unable to adjust height without help 
Okay! 
A lot of effort for ok results 
It works but.. 
Meh ... so-so 
Nothing Special about Krud Kutter Green Pressure Washer Concentrate. 
Powerwasher it ain't 
meh 
It's ok. Not really strong enough 
Krud Kutter HS01 for power washing 
Disappointing 
Meh 
Okay as a general cleaner but didn't do anything for mildew or bird droppings 
works somewhat 
Didn't help clean my house but my patio looks better 
A rare miss 
Powerful but heavy and short. It's just okay. 
keep looking 
Not finished with my first try 
Has some weight to it 
Remington trimmer/edger 
If You Don't Want to Spend Too Much This is a Good Choice 
Works as it should but beware of the negatives 
Cannot tell if it works 
Looks good 
Not like the fluted version 
HUGE \REALLY HUGE\ 
Reasonable quality pool hose. 
Nice bench poor packaging and assembly instructions 
Nothing Special but ok. 
Sleek Product but Overpriced 
Overpriced for this level of quality 
As pictured 
Bus Seats for Stragglers 
Looks great but not very functional ~ 
Rusts fast 
lightweight but low power battery 
Way too hard to load! 
not great 
Kills but not sure if it's quick 
Strangles mice a few feet from trap. 
Works Well But... 
Hard to Set Up but it did kill a mouse 
Innovative design but intended for smaller critters. 
Neutral on the stars because I can't fairly review this 
Unusual Mouse Trap 
...Not Impressed 
Not Sure About This 
It works sort of but I'll stick with snap traps 
It's HARD to set up this trap! 
easy to set but I haven't caught a mouse 
Awesome Trap Cheaply Built 
Not impressed 
how to build a different mouse trap 
It Works But Just Isn't For Me 
Ugh. 
Sorry I don't like this 
Works as advertised 
Catchy little item 
No Mice. 
Not a bad product but Have-a-heart traps are easier to use 
TOMCAT Multiple-Catch Mouse Trap 
No mice! 
It Works But Requires Checking At Least Twice a Day 
Maybe our mice  are too big for this trap 
No mouse yet 
It's OK 
A plaything 
Average MTD-built quality; RM2520 is a better value 
Just OK but I probably would look for a different trimmer 
Taped box with missing parts arrived - so so neutral review 
so far it works ok 
Adequate for the Price 
not for the faint of heart 
Easy to Set 
Effectiveness of mole trap highly dependent on experience and luck! 
Didn't Work For Me - But Don't Fault The Device 
Imma tryin' to be a Mole Killer 
Works great IF you can locate the mole! 
Easy to Set... Haven't killed anything yet 
So far no luck 
No success yet... 
Might Work If You Have Time Patience and More Than One Trap 
Cumbersome not to say scary to set up 
Too much hassle. 
No moles yet 
A strong trap rather easy to use not too effective in my yard. 
Careful planning determines rate of success. 
Not much success 
No moles trapped so far update 
Trade off with ease of setting versus a stronger spring 
no success with voles 
Hasn't worked yet 
An Expensive Product with a Found Solution 
Still not perfect but better than many similar products 
Aesthetically Novel but Functionally Limited 
Kind of torn on these. 
Moderately Good Limiting in Strength and Size 
Works great easy to use. 
Work well but not versatile 
Handy when you are securing small plants 
They work... but 
Neat clip for plants orchids etc. 
barely adequate 
A Little Skeptical so far.... 
Wish it was better. 
Black & Decker TL10 8.3 Amp Corded Electric Front Tine Tiller 
Useful but not everyday tiller for heavy clay 
Nerve poison ... effective but problematic 
Not the one I'd choose. Here's a summary of them all: 
Prefer this over the tier 1 traps which require replacing bait. 
Refillable mouse killer station 
BAIT STATION THAT wORKS TO KILL MICE 
Be Careful if you have cats that eat mice 
all that glitters is not gold - apply with caution 
Gimmicky spray to make natural leaves look like shiny plastic. 
Makes leafs shine 
Not a fan of the foam application 
Awkward application 
Convenient way to tend the garden 
Easy to Assemble but Battery Charger DOA 
Disappointed 
Adequate Smoker 
All Ps and no please 
Holds a Lot of Seeds 
No complaints from the birds.... 
Two Feeders In One: A The Perky-Pet 325S Panorama Wild Bird Feeder By Woodstream Corp. Review 
It's a middle of the line review... 
Fancy squirrel feeder?? 
Good feeder but lousy packaging 
Huge and heavy 
Good build easy to fill drains fast 
Very attractive but a bit cumbersome with stiffer hoses 
Sturdy nice design but not any easier to access & use your hose 
CobraCo HHBEESTL-AC Beehive Steel Hose Holder 
Trade Honey for Hose 
Save your money and spread by hand. 
Still Waiting for Results Any RESULTS 
Works Well......... For a While. 
Jury's still out. 
New spreader cap is good not great. Is it worth the extra money? 
Like a well oiled machine..for small jobs 
Comes up a bit short for some 
Drat! 
Nice.  Very nice.  Edger may need getting used to. 
birds don't like it much. 
Not Suitable for Open Windy Areas 
Cute Feeder But Designed to Feed the Ground More than the Birds 
Too expensive for the quality 
Nice Design Weak Construction 
Painted copper color 
Yes it works fine but what is the real cost? 
Attractive & Affordable Feeder But Will It Withstand Harsh Winter 
Attractive Feeder But Seed Spills Out Easy 
Hang it or set it out 
Well thought out 
For small birds only and it's all plastic 
Ok for small birds 
Good concept tiny tray. 
If You Build It it DOESN'T mean they'll come. :( 
Perky-Pet Water Cooler Bird Waterer 
Doesn't refill itself 
Not So Perky 
Very little replenishment 
Perky-Pet Products - MADE IN THE USA! Great SMALL Bird Waterer 
Never saw a bird on it in 3 weeks 
Easy to assemble but doesn't attract many birds 
Decent for the price 
extremely powerful gas hedge trimmer.  This does vibrate a lot so not for those with arthritis. 
Beautiful but not popular with our hummingbirds 
Birds (& Ants) like it; bottle can't stand upright for filling plastic base 
It's Okay 
Very nice design; easy to fill 
OK for a couple of birds 
definitely attracts the hummers 
High quality but infrequent hummingbird visits 
Looks Good Has a Few Flaws 
Look Ma No Leaks 
beautiful large capacity hummingbird feeder with perches 
Purchase hook separately! 
It leaks. 
Broke in Less than 1 Month  -Customer Service was Great and Responsive 
Looks great very high quality. 
Beautiful but has some design issues 
Shorter range foam falls down 
I guess it works..........kinda 
Good starter tiller except the telescoping handle no longer works 
Hit & Miss 
Blower 
works well if you can stomach the thought of using it 
So far nothing caught 
Creepy... 
Think it through before you buy 
Good to use for insects and spiders 
The trap works 
Poor packaging almost ensures a defective product 
Bit loud not all that convenient to use as a duct line booster 
Poor design of propeller causes noise 
Strong ducting fan needs external power control extension cord. 
This duct booster should be installed by a pro. 
Noisy when used blocks air when off 
No-frills Inline Ducting Booster Fan 
iPower GLFANXBOOSTER6 Inline Ducting Booster Fan with cord 
Having them want you to spread it and then water it seemed like a pain 
So far so good. 
Granules Contain Castor Oil to Repel Moles and Gophers 
Did annoy the gophers to dig more holes elsewhere. 
Discontinued by Manufacturer 
Ineffective only against starving or rabid animals 
needs 20 minutes of watering to apply 
Haven't noticed new tracks 
This is a repellant 
Costly moles and gophers 
Castor oil based repellent 
Convenient easy and practical application 
Only \repelled\ the gophers to dig more holes elsewhere. 
Ineffective only against starving or rabid animals 
Works to move the moles. 
Would not repurchase 
Rusting after 2 months 
Looks good  But ! 
Looks nice on my balcony 
Cross your fingers and hope it arrives in good shape 
Not quite what I had in mind but cute 
Cushion doesn't stay put 
Not without faults - UPDATED 4/19/13 
Questionable quality 
Maybe the fault is mine but . . . 
Works fine for us in the end 
Not too happy with this design

Great design but one major flaw

Nice Idea With One Flaw 
Multi-Nothing 
Hasn't caught any mice yet 
Good idea but has thusfar been ineffective. 
Helpful but smaller than I'd like 
only makes sense if you use propane 
Not 'infrared' in the traditional sense. This is basically a steamer/smoke box 
Effective but not efficient 
We couldn't get the lid off! 
Gronomics Cedar Garden Bed Oil 
Good for protecting your investment 
Don't expect miracles especially with skunks 
... an OK way to clean the grill and Im satisfied with it but I would have used my old ... 
I like using it. 
Inexpensive 
It works but.... 
so far an improvement but not 100 percent 
Hard to Evaluate This but It Smells Nice 
Black racer is still out there but not in my greenhouse 
Okay. 
It's just 'okay' 
Probably best for small areas 
Works but shouldn't be used on plants for human or animal consumption ... 
Works a little 
Safe essential oil based formula for deterring small animals 
Doesn't seem to work on black rats 
The squirells hate it... if you squirt the squirrels 
Pretty expensive for the amount I'd need 
A mild mole/subterranean rodents deterrent but they won't B Gone. 
Mole Relocator 
Couldn't tell if it worked but it would take a lot of this to go over my whole yard 
Castor oil works better than anything but it's still not 100% 
Smells bad 
Wold not repurchase. 
Verdict is still out... 
Ok 
It worked but moles came back 
Hostas vs. the voles 
It works on some things but not all things 
Not completely effective against all dogs and cats. 
My truck-bed is now left alone 
Works Great When You Also Sprinkle Black Pepper 
Decent portable power source but -- there are superior options especially for Android users 
Slow and gave me mixed results 
Disappointing 
goal zero silver recharge add on 
Mixed feelings 
Where are my interchangeable tips? 
Slow to Charge My iPod 
I prefer the eJupiter 787 
OK for what it is but read the \what's included\ carefully... 
Okay for very light watering needs 
A bit flimsy 
Works but... 
great idea but bad execution 
For some reason I smile every time I look at it... 
This is not your daddy's hose..... 
Rumford Gardener 75-Feet Expanding Hose 
It really IS light.  So is the flow of water 
Very unique hose 
A novel garden tool that's convenient to store but not quite as useful as my standard hose 
So light...but not very sturdy 
OK for a small yard & deck not enough pressure otherwise 
Kind of odd 
Extra large spatula 
Scary stuff boys and girls 
Adequate protection from mosquitoes 
Not bad but I like ThermaCELL products better 
mosquitos might leave you alone but flies will eat you alive 
Uses linalool to mask exhaled carbon dioxide; Scent cartridge & Batteries included; Remove tab from cartridge 
Major limitations 
Good Concept 
Works mostly.... 
So So 
Cute Lantern & Repels Skeeters ALSO! 
No deet 
Ingredient works great but pump sprayer works better 
Do the job but are not metal 
Okay but Not Sturdy 
Attractive design but falls apart 
Not a great design. 
Quality bird feeder; but not squirrel proof at all 
OK feeder 
Okay... not out of the ordinary however 
Squirrels not to sound clich&eacute;. 
Well constructed but too squirrel friendly 
Loved it while it lasted 
Works OK for small light birds 
Might Last 3 to 4 Months 
Foiling Squirrels 
Build Quality Issue 
Perky-Pet Squirrel Slammer Wild Bird Feeder 
Attractive to Humans--and Semi-Humans 
Great as a seed starter needs more depth for much else 
It has a nice rustic appeal but it's not very practical. 
Cute little box but limited use 
Cute larger than expected width-wise 
A nice gift and suits rustic style houses 
Don't Think About It For More Than Microgreens Or Starter Herbs 
CobraCo WINPLNTR13 Expandable Window Planter 
Cute planter with limited uses 
It's smaller than you think 
Sizing.. 
More tenement than herb garden... 
It's a cute *little* thing 
Ingenious construction a little bit cheap 
Very very small and shallow containers 
Cool But Small 
Quite small and rustic in appearance. 
Wooden Expandable Window Planter From CobraCo 
Cute but small. 
Interesting shape but will only hold 3\ pots 
Long Battery Life 
yeah not bad for a small garden 
Nothing Special - I prefer my traditional gardening tools 
VERY Short Battery Life 
Quality control issues? 
Portable easy to assemble tabletop grill not for everyday use 
Nothing Special

Okay for some bugs 
The Bait Traps Seem To Work Better 
Should be designed better...and less expensive! 
Not a Perfect Product. 
It's OK to start with after a few touch ups it's pretty good 
Not sure it will last 
Not impressed with the liner 
durable handsomebut chain missing. 
Okay but the hose versions might be better for you

More fluff than substance 
Mixed Results 
Some of the pods didn't grow for me.  Neat kit. 
Pricey but cool introductory gardening kit for some 
Perfect for Introducing Children to Gardening not a great way to fill the table 
Good for a beginner - uneconomical for serious gardeners 
Interesting gimmic 
Half and half 
Cute convenient and makes a good gift. 
Suitable for First-Time Gardeners 
50% success rate 
Easy to plant but only a few produced 
They are OK for starting outside 
Waiting To See The Results 
Groables kit 
Waiting to see if they grow 
Not as simple or as practical as it looks 
I considered it gimicky after the fact 
A Simple System 
Interesting idea but only for lazy \gardeners\ 
Verdict is in on the success of this Garden Kit 
Stupid proof? 
A lot of packaging for a microgarden 
cute and quick planting 
Great idea but so so execution 
An Interesting Introduction to Gardening 
A kit for novices to jump-start their gardening effort 
An interesting planting concept tragic that it's not organic 
Maybe good for educational purposes not practical nor cost effective at all. 
For $1 a plant its not a bad deal 
Seed pods seem okay but really not a major improvement over just buying seeds 
Educational But Not Very Practical

Prefer Do It Yourself...But May Be Handy For Some. 
Grab a packet of seeds 
Good for pots 
Cute pods but too little for actual food 
Quite fussy to maintain. 
Okay I suppose 
Teach from seed 
Not too impressed 
Wait! Wait! Don't order in July!! 
A Garden Starter Kit for Super-Beginners 
Good brush 
Not Bad But Not Great 
Works As Designed 
Too small for a rat rat trap n zap.. 
Easy to set up easy to use (updated 12/15) 
Does it work? Doesn't work with rechargeable batteries 
No rats zapped...but it got something else... 
It is what it says but is more restrictive than you might think... 
Works well with one big limitation 
No catch for over a week 
Inconsistent Results And Restrictive Usability 
50 rats?! 
Zip Zap 
Is a bit cumbersome but does the job! 
So it works even if I don't quite buy into the concept 
Works 
Not a bad product some correctable defects! 
Skeptical at best... 
Light Usage 
Good patio hose but not good for actual gardens 
\Rumford Gardener Expanding hose 50-feet Passion Purple\ 
Better than the 75 foot one 
Has a few limitations 
A lot of cover for the money but mine is poorly stitched 
Easy On Easy Off 
Did not fit my smaller fire pit well 
Does \Avant-Garde\ Translate To \Costs 3X As Much?\ 
Expensive 
Fine for occasional use but not for serious work 
High class and excellent Fiskars quality but low value given its price 
A revealing lesson in the present usefulness of solar power 
Works Good but Slow 
A so-so feeder 
One Of The MESSIEST Feeders I've Ever Owned 
Extremely attractive & unique design.... though I worry about how it'll hold up against squirrels 
Popular With The Birds But Perky-Pet Continues To Cut Corners 
Nice looking feeder 
cool looking but the birds don't like it 
Only for sunflower seeds and peanuts! 
Early reviews are raves... from both birds and squirrels 
Not safe for birds!!!! --- this was \repurposed\ as a hanging basket 
Good for Smaller Jobs 
Not for fall leaves 
Very good blower. OK for vacuum 
Incredibly Sturdy Interesting Design 
Seems like a lot of cost and trouble for basic fertilizer 
Not a Fan  of Product 
Excellent Fertilizer But Spreader Stopped Working 
Battery spreader jammed! 
OK For Small Jobs 
Decent fertilizer but pricey and low in organic nitrogen 
Mixed reults 
Very expensive for the amount of fertilizer supplied 
This pansy fertilizer may work but I won't be using it again. 
Pretty expensive which I see as the main drawback. Running a simple experiment to test on pansy growth and blooming. 
Heavy feeders 
Obviously it's too soon to tell whether it winds up being a super friend to my pansies. 
Mileage may vary by user 
More cute than useful 
Goofy product great for \monster footprints\ 
Satisfactory 
Has its uses 
Works and has nice connectors but I saw a nicer one at Lowes for the same price and twice as long 
Nice hose but for this money I prefer the Flexogen line 
Average 
so far so good 
kinks too easily 
Slightly better than my other dozen hoses 
Has some merits but wet leaves are its downfall 
More of a leaf shredder than a mulcher 
Works well for VERY dry leaves struggles with anything else. Really a niche item. 
Large fire pit--but why the high price tag? 
Extends time between watering plants fertilizes but not organic 
A Big Mess! 
Cheap-looking plastic 
Won't hold up to our weather 
A Little Awkward 
Attracts birds but I haven't seen Orioles 
Tough Setup and Only Attracts Raccoons for Us 
A Few Problems 
Flips 
Should do the trick if... 
Lovely jelly mess 
Plastic 
Messy! 
The birds like it. 
Decorative yes functional maybe 
Add a cute factor to your garden bed 
Good Garden Compared to The 7 
Some useful components 
Kind of interesting to play with 
Great idea I HOPE it might work 
Lack of notifications kills it. Great idea but a bit buggy and too expensive to purchase one for each plant. 
Love the idea the product not so much 
decent but more expensive 
Good for certain applications... but be careful and use sparingly!  And keep away from small children... 
You must know the dangers of DEET before you use this product 
Good rose food ok dispensing container 
Might be a nice starter feeder 
Is it really squirrel-proof? 
Best For Smaller Birds and Squirrels 
Updated review.  Not the best feeder 
It is not going to keep squirrels out but could be adapted for other uses 
Dome is good concept but scares birds 
Cute but not practical. 
okay little platform feeder once you ditch the baffle 
It has a place of its own. 
Good for The Short Haul 
A tad small for our yard full of birds 
Not as Good as I Had Hoped 
Good idea poor execution 
not a favorite for our birds 
Not perfect but useable 
A Nice Idea Poorly Executed 
It's so-so 
Bird Feeder 
Not my favorite but... 
Not for windy areas; all the water flows out 
An okay bird waterer that has a couple of issues 
We Shall See... 
Flimsy construction suits the purpose with minor issues... 
Birds are happy but I am not a fan of plastic 
Haven't seen results yet after a week. 
Didn't get the results I'd hoped for... 
safer vs better 
Not as organic as Lawn Restore 1 
Expensive dirt! 
No Miracle for this grower 
So far so good 
Works But Consider the Perky Pet Perky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Feeder As Well 
It's a cute feeder but it mysteriously leaks. So many of the other reviewers also had leaky feeders. 
Works But Larger Size May Not Be Needed.  Bit Harder To Clean Than Other Model(s) 
Nice Glass Reservoir on a Leaky Feeder 
Leaks 
Feeding liquid Mysteriously disappears just like its smaller pinch waist model 
Great For Container Plants ONLY 
Good materials few parts no reel lock 
Heavy Solid Reel. Maybe too heavy and solid. 
Very nice look but will it last? 
Nice looking not sure it will hold up long-term though 
Ah so close! 
Works But Consider The Perky Pet Perky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Unit Instead 
Odd... 
Works fine--nothing special 
Okay feeder just too small 
Not the best I have had 
Durability Is My Concern 
Great if you need a light hose 
It has advantages but these are not equivalent to standard hoses 
It works well but question long-term durability 
Don't Like It 
Convenient but flimsy 
Awesome funusefull hose 
It's legit - with some issues. 
Nice job cleaning questionable quality 
Karcher North America Electric Pressure Washer with Quick Disonnect. 
Karcher 2650 psi gas PW or Karcher 2000 psi electric PW? 
Seems like a very well built and well designed power washer 
Great Idea Bungled A Bit In Execution 
The trimmer itself weighs 5.2 pounds without battery - might not be necessary to get the wheel base 
okay as a lght duty weed whacker/edger not really suitable as a mower 
Initial Mow Review - Spring 2014 
Keep tipping upward. Handle height is not adjustable. 
Cheap components take away from a great looking grill. 
Just OK 
Bad packaging invites problems. 
Not for me 
Interesting grill accessories 
Prefer the Weber cover
