Decibel-O-Meter Free 
More of a toy than a real tool. 
Always shows 40 dB? 
Fun application 
Ok if you NEED one. 
good for a free app 
fun but frustrating 
no good on coby products: ( 
I love catalogues 
More season catalogs 
Almost all right 
Useful not stupendous 
Not for me 
good way to find products 
get more streamline catalogs 
This is an App &amp; a Widget Poorly Designed 
Good concept but needs work 
widget

I wouldn't buy it again... 
Good product for the value

Not Bad but not Great!

Fits well doesn't look great 
Wish the Phone couldbe upgraded 
Some sections of this tape were not sticky 
Good buy 
Not for Me 
it works 
Needed this for replacement of my screen for my droid bionic. Works as it's supposed too. 
A good deal but there are better products out there 
The tape is fine 
Not so sticky 
Works good 
Not what i expected 
Plenty more tape than you'll probably ever need. 
Great Idea but could be better 
Useful I guess... 
It works 
Okay.... 
Its a nice watch when connected rest of the time its a paperweight. 
Weirdly interesting... It works better with OpenLiveView than with Sony's software. 
bad battery life 
ITS OKAY 
Its okay 
Interesting Gimmick 
Screen not showing 
so 
Pretty slippery 
Little loose but I like purple 
Didn't completely fit.. 
Nice rubber case for my phone No cutout for the volume rocker 
Cheap case lack of opening for volume is annoying. 
Quick Fix Nothing More 
Pink Case 
average 
pretty pink 
Wrong Color 
Functional 
It works just fine but ... 
ok but not great 
iPad2 + Droid X not at same time. Bummer 
Only 600mah per port... 
An ok product but is prone to break easily

Works but kind of loose 
Mic is not working properly 
NO CASE (Verizon Product) 
Meh

THE BEST PHONE IN THE WORLD! WELL...ALMOST! 
Droid Charge has wonderful screen 
It's NOT the hardware.  It's the network. 
Charge vs Incredible 2 
..well at least it's pretty. 
Cheap but not so great 
case 
For my HTC 
Three Stars 
Not at par with other android phones 
cell 
Trexcell HTC Evo 3D 3500mah Extended Battery + Cover

not surface pro 
Rubber tip Stylus 
Mistake:  NOT for Galaxy Nexus 
Spudger review 
Simple but effective 
Terrible case! 
This case is a very good case and very sturdy. 
Works to stop scratches but no real impact protection. 
Some good some bad 
not the worst but not worth the money 
Serves its basic purpose 
OK but lots of  Problems with Voice Assist & Recognizing Commands 
WAY TOO BIG 
FM nice listener sound quality not great 
Clear sound but some annoying flaws 
good as a speakerphone for voice but not music 
Compact quick to connect great in 35 mph or slower city driving 
Really great speakers but voice recognition doesn't work! 
Great if you want to use it as a speaker phone 
Call & Text but not so much for Android... 
OK but not great 
Ok but not as good as hoped 
Not a bad Product 
Screen protectors 
Good bubble free film for the iPhone 4S but.... 
Amazing quality 
Good Batteries - Won't Charge in Phone 
nice but doesn't fit good 
bad Experience 
Great product but not too good on this purchase 
Be really really careful installing it or you will mess up your iPhone's screen. 
Great price 
Great product bad replacement procedure 
customer service was nice enough 
Nice but wish it fit tighter... 
It is great for my car 
Would be great if there improvements. 
Not bad idea but not really possible 
bulky 
case for LG800 
Charger is defective...but dock is excellent 
O.K. case for $10 or less 
broke 
its just okay 
Nice 
It would probably be OK if... 
Ok at best 
Its all right but you have to treat with extreme care 
GREAT CHARGER BUT CABLE DIDN'T WORK 
Works most fo the time with the iPad 3 
The cord broke down but the plugs lasting 
It was doing good until.... 
A bit touchy 
Cheap but worth the price? 
Car mount does it's job 
Disappointed 
Output is only 1.5A so it will work for phones but not tablets 
It Works but it's BIG! 
Useful but wish it were more so. 
Good Luck 
Nice cover for the price. 
ok 
BAD then WORSE! 
A product with potential 
Nice simple mount but a bit flimsy 
sort of does the job 
Universal Exomount car mount for portable device 
Decent Phone 
cell 
could be better

Gift For a Friend 
Good for the price.. but not a 4G phone as advertised.. 
Almost... 
OK. But not great due to application method 
Decent protector but still not a static-cling plastic film

Three Stars

Three Stars 
Got my money back 
Good used iPhone with a few extras

Pros:  it's cheap.  Cons:  it's cheap 
Simple quality 
You get what you pay for 
Slim case! 
OKy 
wrong color 
Decent 
bluetooth 
Definitely protects your phone but makes the phone less attractive 
It's not too bad but I expected more 
Liked how soft the case feels. 
Decent phone but has some issues 
My wife never used it because she thought it was ugly. 
Rigid 
Backwards 
Not quite what I expected but a decent case anyway 
Not what I expected... 
It would be better if not for the buttons... 
ok 
You get what you pay for I guess 
Meh 
Best value 
Eh 
Nice but low quality 
its okay 
Sticky buttons but worth it. 
Tight Fit for Micro USB on Galaxy S3 
it's a phone charger 
Not OEM but it works 
HTC as promised. Not OEM for Rezound as advertised. 
I'm not convinced that it's an OEM 
Does the job not fastest 
Cradle 
not what i expected 
OK 
Just about ok.. but good price 
Great phone but data reception in the same spot compared to EVO 4g is HORRID 
LOTTA FLAWS BUT A COUPLE OF GOOD THINGS.

Great car charger if you like USB charging rates... 
Works great... if it fits 
Ok for the money 
Great idea but charges slow 
insanely bright led 
Annoying blue LED - ugh 
Great - IF it's compatible with YOUR DEVICE. 
Needs modification to take advantage of 2.1A rating 
No Wifi although pic shows wifi! 
This is okay 
This thing is tiny!

Decent headset but has some issues 
Just so-so 
Jabra EASYGO

For me it is easier to not use it... maybe it will work well for you 
Only product of it's kind 
A Bluetooth headset for quiet places 
Easy and inexpensive... 
Like(d) it a Lot (until it stopped working)  UPDATED 1/19/12

Just OK and for the price you can do better. 
LOVE IT!!! But all 3 I bought have broke

Great Battery but not the best 
Great technology but not for my ear.

It's an OK headset 
WTH it is an open box item missing parts DO NOT BUY FROM INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTERS!

Updated Review - Rating Demoted from 4 Stars 
Just OK 
Great Indoor Earbuds Battery Could Use Some Work 
The form factor I've been waiting for but would prefer in-ear ... 
The Jabra SPORT Bluetooth is Awesome for Indoor Usage but Horrible for Outdoor Usage 
Weak Battery 
Good Bluetooth Headset with Limited Range 
Its ok 
Easy to use and good sound quality but drops the signal and the cord sticks to your neck 
Overall: Not Bad 
Product is nice 
Beware if you have small ears or older devices 
Keeps falling out 
Poor sound quality 
Jabra SPORT - not the best 
Great Features some poor funtioning 
Conditional pass..  please read. Buy Anker or Seidio 
initially good... doesnt hold up well under long term use. 
Case does not fit the phone 
so-so 
A bit of  a let down 
Pretty Good for the Price - low quality cover 
Back cover 
You get what you paid for

White iPhone Case

Bubbles didn't go away 
Pricey but works fine. 
Screen protectors 
Okay

Phone case 
Pretty but not dependable 
Crazy 
yickes! 
nice little headset 
Sound quality not up to Jawbone standards BUT TELLS YOU THE CALLER'S NAME! 
Mixed performance 
Middle of the road price and performance 
Does NOT work with iPhone 4S and Siri 
A little expensive... 
Dubious microphone quality 
Screencover 
Cheap but inferior 
Nice starting package 
Decent Range 
Holds iPhone securely good quality; required app is the weak link 
Good idea killed by bad execution. works ** ONLY ** w/ LiveAction 
Tripod feature only real benefit. 
Some simplicity with some complexity 
Like the idea needs better support (from Apple?) to be useful. 
Not as helpful as I was hoping it would be 
not needed 
Good invention with limitations 
Neat idea; limited to Belkin's photo app 
I like the hardware.  The software is not so great. 
Live Action Camera Grip for IPhone 
EASY TO USE BUT.... 
Useful if iPhone is the Only Camera You Use 
Neat concept but loses points for price and app limitations 
Cool accessory but is there a need for it? 
Not bad but not impressive for the price 
Good product hobbled by proprietary app 
The grip is great. The app...not so much... 
good functional design but unnecessary 
IOS 5 upgrade makes your volume button to act like Camera button 
Makes the camera easier to hold but doesn't add much functionality 
Cute for the price! 
Pretty but broke easily 
It's okay. 
Windshield phone holder 
Cheap 
I have Mixed feelings - case is okay but customer service is Exceptional

BlueAnt Headlock Stereo Headphones 
Unpretentious 
Premium headphone but not my type of sound 
Great case

ER Power 
Didn't stick to the phone well 
Works as designed but lots of prints/smudging 
good for the money 
Great price if you can live with the aggravation 
useless travel charger 
spare battery 
Works with Nortel T7316 
more charge duration needed 
Good Battery 
Very stiff. 
tip becomes mushy after use but other than that good stylus 
locked 
Touch is slow 
Love these but they don't work with iPhone 5 
Should you get another Blackberry? 
Case is cool 
Quality Varies w/ Diztronic 
Neat invention love the flash light doesn't fully charge Droid DNA with 1200 MAH battery

Comfortable to wear sound is much to be desired 
Kind of disappointed 
i thought it was supposed to be better than the older version...

Nice works well. 
Its ok 
it nice device 
Plantronics over makes good headset. What happened to this one? 
underSTAND? 
Decent for the money 
Powering Down Downer 
Bulkier than holsters and the metal clip is harder to use than the plastic clips I am use to. 
Good deal for the money 
Not as expected

Fyi 
The battery was alright 
S2 battery 
Works but doesn't seem to match the quality of my original

cheap 
it okay 
really 
a little stiff hard to press volume buttons 
Only OK 
Marginal at best 
Made a mistake. 
OK but with a few dislikes 
Sticky--for a while perhaps 
it's ok 
Holds phone fine shakes too much for my liking. 
Great for navigation 
It can be improved 
Strong hold on dashboard but swivel and clamp are a bit finicky 
Hope you don't have a Nissan Altima or other similar dash style. 
Shaky and suction cup won't hold well in heat 
Doesn't fit Galaxy Note 3 with Otterbox Defender. 
Works on almost anything 
iOttie One-Touch windshield and dashboard car mount for Galaxy Note 2

Great dashboard for the Note 3 
Battery Charger 
Great charger for my spare batteries  -  takes different sizes 
It's only good if you don't bunny hop around 
Good 
Order a size down 
barely fits my g3 
Stays put but a bit bulky and Amazon has some more compact units that work just as well! 
It works on certain cars...

Shaking a little 
Doesn't fit with phone in case 
Works great but a little brittle 
Not bad not great 
I like the idea... 
Nice hold. 
Works but doesn't seem real sturdy 
Great but dont use it with an extended battery 
Nicely made they forgot that we all uses cases 
Works Okay. Is Fussy. Requires constant adjusting. Gets hot. 
Fits the iPhone 5 but not what I need it for which is the S3 (with OTTERBOX) and S4 
I wish I know where I put it 
Pretty good as long as you don't have to move it much 
it is fine 
Not bad 
Suction goes away 
I like it but... 
The suction is the sticky kind 
Not quite ready for prime time 
Air Pockets Needed

Great for writing...for less than 2 months. 
TL;DR Micro-knit tip is nice but not as sensitive or precise 
Great stylus but... 
Okay if you are careful about the pressure you apply 
was not up to my expectations 
Works better than most if you have a screen protector 
Nice but not durable

Its Okay for the price not for the quality. 
Definately amazing batterly life just OK back cover 
Decent but not amazing 
Needs an overhaul 
Finky 
Looks decent but has flaws 
elegant if a little confusing to use 
Well designed but pricy for what you get 
Good but expensive for the capacity. 
Handy little charger 
Good Idea  Too Bulky 
Rather heavy and bulky 
Ok but not my top pick of portable chargers. 
I like it but... 
Works better than other devices I have tried but still needs some work. 
Works well when it works correctly. 
Does the job but overpriced 
Limited Energy Storage For The Size 
Only good for an emergency 
Nicely designed but doesn't store enough power 
Nice to have but I recommend getting a battery with more capacity 
Works in a pinch 
feels expensive and thoughtfully designed like all the Tylt products I have reviewed 
Tylt Energi Travel Charger: USB convenience in a small package but... 
Great design but tiny capacity 
If you've got a lifetime to wait..... 
Eh. It's okay 
Overpriced and Underpowered But Has A Few Redeeming Features 
Good for maybe 1/3 charge on my smartphone 
Compact light weight but low capacity hinders usefulness 
Safe for kids toys 
Cheap price okay product 
Disappointed 
Cool phone case 
Good case not enough room for charging cord. 
Refurbished??

WTH it is an open box item missing parts DO NOT BUY FROM INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTERS!

Just OK 
Great Indoor Earbuds Battery Could Use Some Work 
The form factor I've been waiting for but would prefer in-ear ... 
The Jabra SPORT Bluetooth is Awesome for Indoor Usage but Horrible for Outdoor Usage 
Weak Battery 
Good Bluetooth Headset with Limited Range 
Its ok 
Easy to use and good sound quality but drops the signal and the cord sticks to your neck 
Overall: Not Bad 
Product is nice 
Beware if you have small ears or older devices 
Keeps falling out 
Poor sound quality 
Jabra SPORT - not the best 
Great Features some poor funtioning 
Conditional pass..  please read. Buy Anker or Seidio 
initially good... doesnt hold up well under long term use. 
Case does not fit the phone 
so-so 
A bit of  a let down 
Pretty Good for the Price - low quality cover 
Back cover 
You get what you paid for

Pretty but not dependable 
Crazy 
yickes! 
nice little headset 
Sound quality not up to Jawbone standards BUT TELLS YOU THE CALLER'S NAME! 
Mixed performance 
Middle of the road price and performance 
Does NOT work with iPhone 4S and Siri 
A little expensive... 
Dubious microphone quality 
Screencover 
Cheap but inferior 
Nice starting package 
Decent Range 
Holds iPhone securely good quality; required app is the weak link 
Good idea killed by bad execution. works ** ONLY ** w/ LiveAction 
Tripod feature only real benefit. 
Some simplicity with some complexity 
Like the idea needs better support (from Apple?) to be useful. 
Not as helpful as I was hoping it would be 
not needed 
Good invention with limitations 
Neat idea; limited to Belkin's photo app 
I like the hardware.  The software is not so great. 
Live Action Camera Grip for IPhone 
EASY TO USE BUT.... 
Useful if iPhone is the Only Camera You Use 
Neat concept but loses points for price and app limitations 
Cool accessory but is there a need for it? 
Not bad but not impressive for the price 
Good product hobbled by proprietary app 
The grip is great. The app...not so much... 
good functional design but unnecessary 
IOS 5 upgrade makes your volume button to act like Camera button 
Makes the camera easier to hold but doesn't add much functionality 
Cute for the price! 
Pretty but broke easily 
It's okay. 
Windshield phone holder 
Cheap 
I have Mixed feelings - case is okay but customer service is Exceptional

Great price if you can live with the aggravation 
useless travel charger 
spare battery 
Works with Nortel T7316 
more charge duration needed 
Good Battery 
Very stiff. 
tip becomes mushy after use but other than that good stylus 
locked 
Touch is slow 
Love these but they don't work with iPhone 5 
Should you get another Blackberry? 
Case is cool 
Quality Varies w/ Diztronic

Comfortable to wear sound is much to be desired 
Kind of disappointed

Nice works well. 
Its ok 
it nice device 
Plantronics over makes good headset. What happened to this one? 
underSTAND? 
Decent for the money 
Powering Down Downer 
Bulkier than holsters and the metal clip is harder to use than the plastic clips I am use to. 
Good deal for the money 
Not as expected

Fyi 
The battery was alright 
S2 battery 
Works but doesn't seem to match the quality of my original

cheap 
it okay 
really 
a little stiff hard to press volume buttons 
Only OK 
Marginal at best 
Made a mistake. 
OK but with a few dislikes 
Sticky--for a while perhaps 
it's ok 
Holds phone fine shakes too much for my liking. 
Great for navigation 
It can be improved 
Strong hold on dashboard but swivel and clamp are a bit finicky 
Hope you don't have a Nissan Altima or other similar dash style. 
Shaky and suction cup won't hold well in heat 
Doesn't fit Galaxy Note 3 with Otterbox Defender. 
Works on almost anything 
iOttie One-Touch windshield and dashboard car mount for Galaxy Note 2

Great dashboard for the Note 3 
Battery Charger 
Great charger for my spare batteries  -  takes different sizes 
It's only good if you don't bunny hop around 
Good 
Order a size down 
barely fits my g3 
Stays put but a bit bulky and Amazon has some more compact units that work just as well! 
It works on certain cars...

Shaking a little 
Doesn't fit with phone in case 
Works great but a little brittle 
Not bad not great 
I like the idea... 
Nice hold. 
Works but doesn't seem real sturdy 
Great but dont use it with an extended battery 
Nicely made they forgot that we all uses cases 
Works Okay. Is Fussy. Requires constant adjusting. Gets hot. 
Fits the iPhone 5 but not what I need it for which is the S3 (with OTTERBOX) and S4 
I wish I know where I put it 
Pretty good as long as you don't have to move it much 
it is fine 
Not bad 
Suction goes away 
I like it but... 
The suction is the sticky kind 
Not quite ready for prime time 
Air Pockets Needed

Great for writing...for less than 2 months. 
TL;DR Micro-knit tip is nice but not as sensitive or precise 
Great stylus but... 
Okay if you are careful about the pressure you apply 
was not up to my expectations 
Works better than most if you have a screen protector 
Nice but not durable

Its Okay for the price not for the quality. 
Definately amazing batterly life just OK back cover 
Decent but not amazing 
Needs an overhaul 
Finky 
Looks decent but has flaws 
elegant if a little confusing to use 
Well designed but pricy for what you get 
Good but expensive for the capacity. 
Handy little charger 
Good Idea  Too Bulky 
Rather heavy and bulky 
Ok but not my top pick of portable chargers. 
I like it but... 
Works better than other devices I have tried but still needs some work. 
Works well when it works correctly. 
Does the job but overpriced 
Limited Energy Storage For The Size 
Only good for an emergency 
Nicely designed but doesn't store enough power 
Nice to have but I recommend getting a battery with more capacity 
Works in a pinch 
feels expensive and thoughtfully designed like all the Tylt products I have reviewed 
Tylt Energi Travel Charger: USB convenience in a small package but... 
Great design but tiny capacity 
If you've got a lifetime to wait..... 
Eh. It's okay 
Overpriced and Underpowered But Has A Few Redeeming Features 
Good for maybe 1/3 charge on my smartphone 
Compact light weight but low capacity hinders usefulness 
Safe for kids toys 
Cheap price okay product 
Disappointed 
Cool phone case 
Good case not enough room for charging cord. 
Refurbished??

Overhyped. 
Good lights bad value 
Sylvania zXe Halogens 
WORKS GREAT BUT BEWARE THE CD 
Works perfect on late model cars. 90's cars seem to have an issue though. 
Needs end-user adaptation 
its okay for the price 
Meh 
Not a good buy for a vehicle! 
Accurate but... 
Not a grease 
Great price questionable durability 
Nice to have a set of 4 but a bit loose on my jacks 
Just not flexible enough! 
Just ok 
Expensive for what it is.  May become visible on light-color cars. 
Too thin 
Quality product but limited protection. 
If you love your car you will like it! 
not leather 
It's a purse!! 
Not Low Clearance 
Heavy duty but 
Does the job 
Disconnect switch 
This cleaner is OK there are better products

Camco 39847 - Haven't Used it Yet....Reason for 3 Stars 
Could be worse 
Okay Product 
bright but not the easiest light on the eyes. 
Bright lights but stay dim when off 
Difficult to work into the socket and get them to make contact 
Great idea is longer than 168 bulbs are so check first

In my case there don't quite 'cut it' .... here's why:

It works but....

It works 
Reasonable Quality with Some Flaws. 
I never noticed the 50/50 on the jug so now ... 
Slightly brighter than stock 
OK Item 
Not much different than OEM 
Lightweight copper anodized aluminum wire 
Great for frost and ice but made for lefty's 
Good so far awaiting test conditions... 
On the whole it's OK but not the greatest 
OK but a bit bulky. 
Good but bulky 
It's just Okay 
very light weight 
Great Idea But... 
Monster Scraper 
Good but it has some cons too 
Decent tool with some quirks but pricey for what you get 
no extras 
Better than Anco Not as Good as Rain-X 
Shreak free and hugs windshield but... 
Works OK; not as effective as the Bosch ICON 
Good blade Bulky adapter 
Needs duct tape to hold it together. 
Good design nothing extraordinary or special though 
Works fine but nothing special. Costs too much I think. 
Works well but kinda ugly 
It's a wiper blade 
Mediocre- Middle of the Road Wiper Blade 
Functions great but I don't like the design very much 
Easy to install... brighter than stock though? 
48 SMD White LED Light Panel 
Not super bright 
The outside of this cargo bag likes to collect bugs and they are hard to clean off. 
Meh ok 
Some of the LEDs on one bulb stopped working after 4 months intermittent use. 
Not Very Impressive 
Initially disappointed in the build... 
Decent Hardware but Software Lacking 
Good for high tech mechs if you need one for around the house better alternatives are around .** Company response in comments 
Confusing menus poor instructions Windows and subscription required for advanced features 
Mid-Quality 
not really good for Cars 
Details Matter 
Disappointed

Great idea but I prefer the cd mount 
Very touchy and no sticker? 
Hey they work.  Fits Toyota Tacoma 
Good idea but poor quality 
I like it but shoddily assembled. 
Price is good for as many as there is. 
Basic cheap microfiber cloths 
Average if that. 
ehh 
Nothing Special - It's an Acne Face Pad for Your Car 
Bit gimmicky 
Like most Meguiar's products a lot of marketing hype and satisfactory results nothing spectacular. 
Good but not great 
Decent Headlight Restorer But Overpriced 
Confusing directions; some effort required; missing pieces 
Mixed feelings 
Grey wax 
Not really Black 
not as foamy as they say 
so so 
Diamond Plate Chrome Motorcycle Cup Holder 
The Jury is Still Out 
Griots Garage 6 inch Random Orbital 
They are bright they fit in the socket they are designed for.  Some of mine had bad LEDs.  Order extra if you buy. 
fair 
It did help but it was a little on the small side 
Not a bargain becomes soft in high heat 
One roll is not enough 
More of a Project than I Anticipated 
The size of this product limits its application 
Works As Advertised But Can Be Costly 
A lot of work for only a small difference you will need many rolls to do a entire vehicle 
Doesn't seem to make a huge difference 
Works fine but is too small for most applications 
Sometimes It's Best To Use A Professional 
Not enough to do much with 
Sound Reduction 
Fitment was hard 
Works fine. 
Very soft but the border. 
Better than using an old tee shirt

Bottles leak at the threading - possibly fixable - may not be good for some chemicals 
A Toy That Would Be Nice To Have 
a kit to add LED color lighting inside your vehicle 
Very good but expensive drop-in replacement bulb 
A decent cleaner that comes with its own dirt 
Nonsense 
Open it and leave it outdoors for a couple days 
does not work on right side mirror 
Perfect for most needs! 
May not work well with Android phones

Thick is that a plus or a minus? 
Nice larger microfiber towel but not ideal for drying 
Not my favorite scent 
Functional Water Sucker Brusher 
Really? 
maybe i didn't need it 
Some were not as advertised 
i like how its bright 
Too  much rain to give a full review but not bad so far! 
Not what I hoped 
Work pretty good 
Sponges wrapped in microfiber. 
Good deal grabby feel 
Installation Trickery if you already have DRL 
Sylvania led Driving Pipe DRL/Accent light kit 
This is not what you think it is... Not for the DIY for sure! 
I think a good coating of wax would work just as well ... 
3.5 Stars Good Protection But Difficult To Apply 
Needs precise application cures/dries with rough surface and very difficult to remove 
Clear instructions  be sure to prep first 
Peels off within a week 
For good results leave the application to a professional 
Not for used cars 
More Of A Professional Product 
Wait until spring if you don't have a garage. 
YMMV.  Undoubtedly messy and esults can be good depending on your skill and experience. 
Only for the skilled DIYer 
Scary stuff 
Overrated 
Pretty cool 
Great sunshade badly packed 
Cheap-ass sunshade but cool-ass design.

Good Product Needs More Complete Instructions 
I am sure it works real good as promised by Battery Tender 
For interior small sanding projects. 
Not Worth the Trouble for Hand Sanding 
Works ok with flaws 
Awkward but effective 
Not what I would classify as \Ultra Thick\ 
Too much to deal with 
Good for tracking locations. Does not sync all drive activity. 
Has Potential But Its Current Iteration Offers Limited Usefulness 
Great idea 
Nice start; needs some improvements to be truly useful; mpg was way off which is a problem 
Has Some Usefulness But Be Aware of Limitations 
Great concept decent execution.  Wears down phone battery quite a bit though. 
Great idea not quite there yet however 
Too big and bulky for me 
No raised edge to catch water runoff... 
Annual Fee makes this a no-go 
Initial activation woes. Serious privacy concerns. But I kinda like it. 
I don't really see any value in it 
Great for spying on your teenage drivers - but that's about it 
Easy to Use but SERIOUS Privacy Issues 
Clearly good at what it's supposed to do 
Not \new car\ fragrance but effective 
DUB Tire Shine.. It's Okay. 
Do you like Pi&ntilde;a Caliente? Do you like getting caught in the rain...? 
Smells really bad 
Seems to work alright but hard to compare versus other cleaners 
Right size absorbency for bar towels 
Zwipes Burgundy Waffle Weave Towels

Well made but doesn't add much to the car 
Bright but with some flaws 
Good for some people not for others 
Does What it Promises but Size is a Limitation 
works but has limitations you may not want to compromise for 
It's ok fo the money? 
Doesn't fit nicely around the crib and too thin to reduce bruises 
waste of money? Very polyester. 
Keeps the pacifier in the crib 
It's an okay liner. 
This is good but is far from perfect 
Good product 
Good for a while 
If you care how it looks try something else if you have a solid-end crib 
It's OK

Stain easily 
Okay 
strange... 
These spoons are okay but not my favorite 
useful but small 
Eh. 
Great for convenience; very mediocre for pumping 
Expected a better pump 
Disappointed with its performance! 
Convenient and portable but VERY SLOW 
Beware - Lactation Consultants Advise Against This Pump 
Works okay but is too loud and spills too often. 
Nice to get things done while pumping but horrible letdown 
watch out for spilled milk! 
Okay but not worth the extra cost 
three and a half stars 
A must but very poorly designed. 
Works well if all other dishes are clean 
Okay

Pretty good. 
Shrinks lengthwise but super soft. 
Great at first but morphs over time 
Not so soft 
seems ok but.... 
Baby Blanket 
Organic... but made in China? 
Great toy but be warned: FALSE ADVERTISING! 
Didn't work for us 
They're just OK

Slows down access 
OK product does its job 
get the job done...kinda 
Get the better brand instead

Great colors 
Good quality but too small 
Cute but can really only use 1 side 
Not awful but don't need more 
Pretty but not practical 
Stiff material

Looks vs Function 
Only the terry cloth side is absorbent. 
Cute But Scratchy & Not Very Absorbent. 
Cute but not very practical 
Cute... 
Cute but not the best quality 
just ok 
Cute but... 
Generous size but not as soft as I had hoped 
beautiful but... 
It's a fairly low quality decorative towel 
Not soft/plush 
Not as nice as I expected 
Manly and nice looking but really too small to be a diaper bag. 
Bought 3 and used them twice in 7 months 
Average washcloths 
Decent washcloths but nothing out of the ordinary 
prefer the snap n go 
Not Needed 
Baby jogger makes some great stuff not too impressed with this though. 
for the same price buy a cheap stroller frame for your carseat. 
It works 
DOES NOT WORK ON CITY SELECT MODEL! Make sure you order the right one! 
We haven't found this useful. 
Much larger than I expected. 
same as regular clipper 
Can't really see the baby's nails 
Okay 
Light is a plus but the clippers are not very sharp. 
Light button is a design flaw 
Baby Nail Clippers 
bad design 
Light doesn't help me 
Hate the light feature 
Ok 
Not my favorite swaddle blanket 
Nice product but for smaller babies only 
too many bells and whistles 
Makes tummy time tolerable 
Not too thrilled 
just ok 
Ehhh 
Nice mat - not a miracle however 
Cute but my daughter didn't use it long 
Just ok. 
Great idea 
Makes Tummy Time a little more tolerable 
boring... 
Real cute  but does not fit on the high chair tray 
Works but still able to move 
Successful ... for about 10 minutes 
Cute designs but the suction ring comes off 
A little disappointed 
Cute plate but suction base is pointless 
Wore out to quickly 
Great Looking Just Not Durable 
They don't hold much... 
Fat mouth! 
Not sure how I feel about these 
Spoons are a bit large for toddler's mouth 
Cute pattern small neck hole. 
Love the design but haven't held up well 
Cute but not as easy to clean as other vinyl bibs 
Regular 
Cute bibs but quality is just okay

I would get it again 
It works ok 
Good for Travel - not everyday 
It's sort of pricey 
Very Cute 
Doesn't stick to tub/Great customer service

Won't Buy Again 
not so great 
A little too big for my little guy 
Not great for scooping 
I don't love these 
Easy scoop but messy! 
Makes a GREAT teether 
Too Big For Little Mouths 
They're just okay. Sorta good sorta bad. 
Better with accessories 
Undecided 
Not as easy. 
careful with the legs could pinch! 
Useful but not amazing 
meh. no better or worse than other tiny potties really. 
Not sturdy in \potty\ position 
Pointless... 
Never Got to Use It 
I got the reusable liners and re-fills too 
Great portable potty but a bit short 
Good concept but kids not certain.  Maybe after fully-trained. 
Not great for boys going pee 
Buy with Reusable Liner for best results 
Quite low to the ground and too small for a 3 year old 
Doesn't work as well for boys 
unstable as a stand alone 
Great idea but small! 
Gets the Job Done 
Don't squeeze the bottle 
Great crib but NOT great toddler bed! 
Love Naturpedic but this is not their best

Not really worth the high price 
Our baby ignores it 
Not a favorite 
Nice product but not a baby essential 
This is mostly useless but cute...

Easy to use but not amazing looking 
Did the job but it's heavy and has cracks 
Good but overpriced 
Easy to use hard clay 
Pretty good.  Subject to recent recall. 
Big 
works well 
DaVinci Emily 2 Sided Crib Mattress 
My baby seems to be comfortable but it doesn't fit my Emily Crib? 
Not worth the price 
This monitor is louder than my sleeping baby. 
Just Okay 
So-so quailty but the design is good. 
Nice Size 
My son loves it but.... 
Glad I just borrowed it 
Works well not easy to hang. 
i like it but I like toys better then the baby

Not very satisfied. 
cute 
It's just OK

Got a blue one for my daughter 
Not as advertised 
Ok product 
Not as advertised 
Pills 
Nice blanket 
Pills a lot! 
Disappointed 
An adequate travel system. 
Does the job 
Break Easily 
Works 
Great for transitioning off of bottle... 
Probably no worse than anything else similar 
Hard to open & close 
Have used for 11 months with first baby will not use for second 
good but leak 
Skeptical 
Meh. 
Okay 
Try another brand first but if it doesn't work try this one 
Opt for the glass ones 
Excellent.....until they start leaking 
Too many parts to clean 
good & bad... 
Leak and hard to clean 
System works... but get wide-neck! 
Didn't reduce spit up 
If you don't make sure to fill correctly they leak 
take forever to dry 
Wares out Quickly! 
Works consistently for a few months but then needs replacing 
Would have been better if it told me I wasn't drunk 
Toddler Helper 
Worked 
Decent product 
Wish I'd tried Munchkin 
Not as good as I thought 
They're too shallow. And they look rather cheap for Gerber. 
Ideally Good but not well balanced and the spoon is shallow 
nice but I don't think you can select the color assortment you receive 
Good product 
JUST OKAY 
Small 
Nice spoons 
I prefer the Ekstra style 
didn't work for me 
This is a fine swim diaper. But be careful in the car! 
Makes transitioning from the pool tricky but great colors! 
Quality construction has minor cons. 
It's okay....but not great. 
Its okay... 
our first failed attempt 
it's ok 
My son loves this swing but it could be much better... 
Cute swing but pretty useless unless you grow batteries 
No AC Adapter but Runs Forever on D.  Rather Loud. 
Great EXCEPT... 
Cute but needs some changes 
Cool but not used that much 
My 9 month old daughter likes it but... 
like don't love 
decent toy my daughter just doesnt care for it 
boring 
Mediocre 
Speaker on the bottom? 
Just wish it didn't have the foam head backing 
Mixed review depending on age 
Be careful during assembly... wobbly legs! 
Baby is happy but daddy is not 
We returned this 
Inexpensive booster seat 
Functional but easy to outgrow 
Love it - But Not Recommended by Experts 
too short 
Hard to release 
Not THAT hard to open 
Works great to lock your cabinets but quite a hassle to remove. 
They're OK 
Baby can peel these off really easily 
They peeled off pretty easily. 
Not so awesome 
Could be better 
just ok 
Okay for some foods 
Cute but motor is a little loud 
Just ok 
The turning mechanism makes a noticeably weird jerking motion each time the mobile turns while in motion 
Cute but loud 
noise with the rotation 
Not for sleigh cribs... 
Fussy baby likes it 
Higher review if it had worked when I received it 
Too small/ Not enough pockets 
Great for older kids not babies 
Functional but un-attractive 
Works ok 
Not available as lid only? 
great lid and replacement cover but silly sippy cup 
These are just the lids!!! 
$$$ for lids that fold too much 
I actually like the little nail files best... 
Lovely but Huge 
A little disappointed 
not comfortable 
Not for me 
I am not a sling fan anymore 
Good but not great 
Not an easy spout 
OK 
Adorable 
Never showed interest 
Okay toy not the best 
looks and feels OK to me but my baby doesn't like it somehow 
Crunch stuff moves in the wash 
Eh 
My Dog Loves It! 
Star teething blanket 
It's ok 
Comb Is Good Brush Too Soft 
I wish I liked it more... 
better options out there 
good value but certain drawbacks 
Everything is good but the toothbrush 
Pretty good but quality is not always consistent 
Doesn't cut it for me 
Just ok 
nice but size is small and I'd prefer that both arm straps open 
It is very warm and functional but only good for the first six to nine months 
good design but temperature guide seems off 
The mat works but could be dangerous. 
Does the job 
Cute but stinks and hard to keep clean 
No smell at all little small though and doesnt seem very comfortable 
Very cute but very flimsy 
Some instruments are more fun than others 
Im going to say okay 
Good if you don't have a dog 
This looks like a dog toy! 
Smells good!! 
Baby ignores it 
Baby seems to like this but worried about safety 
great 
better toy ball than teether 
Good size but too hard 
OK toy not the best teether 
Lifefactory Glass Baby Bottle 9 oz 
Great glass bottle poor venting 
my son choked 
Cap doesn't fit very tight 
Just okay 
May be great for other babies but ours pulled them apart every single time. 
Well not too sure 
Nice but too much flex 
This product is just okay 
The links don't link 
Basic links 
The separate from each other and toys. 
Not great 
links are links 
The rings come off easily 
Okay... 
Good Quanitity but really lightweight 
Attach all the things! 
Too heavy for my daughter to sleep with but it makes a great play mat! 
I expected more for the price 
Works as advertised but watch for scratchy edges 
Rubs my kid's skin 
for Booginhead and MAM pacifier combo users i recommend... 
Love the camo 
It's ok 
Good Pacifier Clip 
Too tight 
Works but... 
Pacifier Strap 
Clip is really difficult to unfasten from clothes 
Great quality except the metal part 
Satisfactory. 
Good Soothie Holder 
great idea if it wasn't damaged 
Just another baby accessory 
Used to be great... 
can potential hurt your finger 
Good sturdy clip but long cord 
Super handy for a while 
Initially loved it but the clip rusts? yuck! 
you can try did not work well for me... 
It's okay 
Great idea - needs to be water resistant 
OK but not used much 
Cute and engaging but with a design flaw 
Alright 
I just wish you could set different times. 
Fine for the price....a purchase not an investment 
I wish the waist was adjustable 
Very baggy but they work. 
Typical Plastic Pants 
Meh 
Wanted to love it 
Cute but falling apart already 
Cute but average quality and poor content 
It's Okay 
Wish it was bigger 
Basic ball 
Wish it came on a different cord 
Small pendant 
Not sure about it 
purchased for baby shower 
Meh 
So cute but defective (probably just mine). 
Not so entertaining 
Cute 
Not as Soft As Expected Not Worth the Money 
Smells weird 
SOLID rubber pacifier 
I wanted to like the pacifier but my daughter didn't! 
I really wanted to like this but.... 
baby didnt like it 
I love them... but baby doesn't. 
Just never takes 
Smell/taste is strong 
These didn't work for us 
nipple size is VERY small 
Nothing special. 
Disappointment 
Didn't work for my child 
just not for us 
Liked the idea but not the execution... 
Did not work for us 
Will or won't your baby enjoy this ? 
great idea design flaws (for my baby anyway) 
doesn't stay in... 
Great product but my baby didn't take to it 
Not bad not as good as expected 
Spill proof cup...really? 
Cute cup but leaks 
Multi-use toy expensive bleeds color smallest cup is of a dangerous size 
Our second seat 
Works... sort of.  Rather large given its target demographic 
good concept 
Nice idea...not so great in reality 
Didn't work for us 
Wish I liked it better... 
great stroller but could use some improvements... 
Terrible if you live in a city 
Good but not the best 
Great but eats up batteries! 
Cute idea but.. 
love it 
Great but weird length 
this thing is huge - would never wear it out in public 
Good bottle for baby - but oz markings are deceiving 
Leak out the bottom 
Great nipple shape and air control poor design 
Baby likes it but it leaks and its hard to clean 
Not living up to the hype 
Diaper Pail Lacking in Quality and Functionality 
Yes and then no... 
Big Baby Deuce still = Odor 
Keeps the stink in. Sort of. 
Find a more durable product...not this one 
Just fine but we just don't use it w/just 1 newborn baby 
It was good till it broke 
Don't like customized refills 
Overpriced plastic garbage bin.  Equally functional and lower priced options available. 
I don't know why people rave about this thing 
Only \Meh\ 
Had to Replace 
Good concept sloppy execution 
Still smells.... 
Durable and Works Well But Expensive to Use 
They keep breaking... 
Its a toss up. 
Works fairly well expensive. 
average diaper pail bit pricey for bags 
An Awkward Overpriced garbage can 
Keeps out the odors but refills are expensive 
Great....But Breaks Easily 
Smells... 
Needs to perform its duty better. 
Maybe there is no such thing as a \good\ diaper pail but this isn't it. 
Regular diaper genie is better and less expensive 
Pretty effective but not totally convinced 
Not plug-and-play 
Ok Baby Carrier 
Sleepy wrap is Boba wrap 
Strange contraption... just a long piece of stretchy cloth 
Too much material 
Easy to adjust but too hot 
More of a novelty than useful... 
It's okay 
Great for first purees but nothing past that 
Could use some simple improvements 
So-So Bath Toy 
Better for younger babies 
It is OK.... 
Still has mold potential. 
Nice toy very heavy 
Ok toy not as much fun as I had hoped 
Not as great as others say it is. 
Chep and functional 
Details to fix leaky problem 
It leaks. 
Always shows hotter than it really is 
Expected More 
potty training made easy!! 
Nice chart but way overpriced 
Cute. 
Baby likes having something to grasp; seems a little cheap. 
Cute 
Had high hopes but my child didn't love it 
Okay but the concept is lost.. 
ok bag but lots of drawbacks 
For the price I just didn't love it enough to keep it. 
Too big for me (even though I have twins) 
Really wanted to love it 
Heavy and tips 
Maybe a little too bendy? 
Great for a short period of time when baby is learning to use utensils 
too flexy & too small of a scoop 
This is not a blankie 
You need to \babysit\ this warmer to avoid overheating of the food 
It works ok but could be so much better 
Works great most of the time. 
Disappointed 
Works... But.... 
Philips AVENT Express Food and Bottle Warmer 
It's ok but it's hard but no timer??? 
It works but could be better 
Okay.... sometimes bottles take long time to warm and switch is in a inconvenient place. 
Simple Operations but No Timer or Auto-Off 
eh 
Fast but not not steady 
Wish it dinged when ready 
No automatic shut off 
It's okay but could be a lot better! 
Does the job 
Its ok...hard to tell when the bottle is ready 
Not Quite as Described

Did not use 
It's ok 
It's ok but I seem to overheat the milk easily 
Handy but Inaccurate 
There are simpler approaches 
Not Mom Friendly 
Does not live up to its hype... 
Better than Philips Avent Express one. 
Functional food warmer. Not well designed. 
Easy to use easy to clean but somewhat unpredictable warming. 
Does the job but with flaws 
Giving a 2nd try 
Quick Cleaning 
Works fine but I wish that they'd come out with BPA free version 
Its Ok 
Easy to use more work to maintain. 
Easy to use stand-alone sterilizer. 
Excellent sterilizer but for the fears about BPA toxicity 
Not poisonous (yay) but not very affordable either. 
Cute 
OK - but Sophie is better! 
I like it more than my daughter does 
Great shape and material but squeaker is annoying 
Not as good as Sophie...

Nice toy for young child to make noise with 
Love JJB this print is ok the material not as thick as older versions

Odd Fabric 
It's ok... 
Don't buy this! 
Can't go wrong with Philips quality and price. 
Nice in many ways but not enough functionality and versatility for general use 
Doesn't stay cold very long 
Mixed feelings 
Pros and cons 
Definitely NOT a must-have but why not?!! 
The better one has mesh siding with snaps 
works but smells

There's nothing \sateen\ about it but it's not a bad sheet 
Great for the price 
Love the material but the elastic breaks too easily. 
Very soft! 
Soft- but... 
So soft but the elastic gave way 
Elastic breaks easily in washing machine; crib sheets do not wear well 
Son didn't like it.

Nice Soft Sheets Bad Elastic 
Soft warm but poor quality 
Just ok 
Sort of like it... 
Not Happy

You don't need these. 
CUTE but a bit hard to install

Sleep sack is great swaddler can't be removed 
Did not work great with the swaddle attachment 
good quality 
Great blanket weak swaddle 
Like it but baby can get arms out too easily. 
Not the best 
Not the tightest swaddle 
Love the concept but... 
Not good enough for my Houdini 
Never used it 
Good only for short time 
Okay 
Stitching came apart after 1 wash... 
Did not work for my Baby but still worth a shot 
My baby wouldn't stay in it 
By the time my baby fit into this swaddling wasn't needed. 
Nicely made 
Great idea but has some design flaws 
It is alright for the price but the swaddle does not detach 
Grumble grumble stupid sleep sack 
Wish they were of cotton instead and had a better zipper 
Don't like the mesh 
Perhaps better suited for older toddlers 
so so...

A little too big 
Sturdy durable not so soft 
Nice material fit is off. Probably don't need if you have a good mattress. 
Expensive for what it is 
Not that great

Really big 
IT IS PRETTY 
Not my favorite 
Can take a beating but to many useless pockets

Great concept...but they get tangled easily 
Pretty good but don't expect perfection 
Very short and can easily be made cheaper 
Not impressive but its okay 
Not for Bottles or Sippy Cups 
Renaming as Secure SOME Toys. 
Better for lighter toys than sippy cups! 
Useful 
Does the job - Could be better 
Found it for half the price at Babies R Us! 
Got the wrong color puke green 
should be bigger should be able to stay seated on seat 
Could be better.. 
Good for a laugh! 
Kind of a Waste of Money 
REALLY plush (almost too much?) 
Good idea but didn't work for us. 
A bit heavy for travel 
Not a miracle bottle 
Good Bottles 
Okay but like Dr. Browns Wide better 
I don't see how this is better than my Avents 
for the price they shouldn't leak 
Baby seems to like them... 
Baby Bottles 
Okay 
Amazing bottles stupid size 
I love it but has serious safety issues. 
horrible smell from paint 
Not Great Not Awesome...Just Okay 
Trying cloth 
Great for newborn and not-yet-mobile babies 
They're OK but make sure your diapers are gauzy enough to snag. 
They don't work on receiving blankets. 
Good but do not love 
Just start with size 2 (toddler size) 
Works as expected 
Most features are great unfortunately one huge con...

Okay for a girl. 
Cute but not very inclusive of 1st year milestones 
useful but bland 
Not the drop in liners my fault for not reading description closely 
I prefer the dop in liners

Too firm for me 
A fail in our house! 
not as good as others 
was ok 
leaky but good price 
Like the Bottles. Dislike the Nipples 
great bottle but.... 
So heavy 
These don't come with a sealing disc 
I wanted so bad to love these

Love that these are glass at a great price 
Pricey but worth the money if it gets you inspired to organize 
wish it was bigger 
pricey 
Useful but overpriced 
Good sippy cup 
one of the better sippy cups 
Decent but not for my daughter!

Nice But Not the Best 
Not bad for the price 
Ok potty but seems a bit awkward for smaller toddlers 
May work for early training.... 
It does what you need it too 
Like the simplicity but too big of a straddle. 
No luck yet 
Ok 
It's REALLY cute but my daughter who is 33.5\ tall has difficulty sitting on this. 
Needs design improvements; forces child to straddle \eyes\ 
Not great... 
Was working at first 
It goes off by itself! 
Needs to be taller 
Adorable but too short 
I prefer the Rainforest Jumper 
Awesome mobile horrible battery life

No more Velcro. 
fit was kind of funky` 
Great- if they stay on 
Velcro is easy but doesn't last

The velcro is what kills it 
They are okay 
They do the job they just don't look cute doing it. 
It's OK... not great. 
Okay 
Needs better velcro 
Ok if you're looking for velcro 
Not the best product available 
Works well but retains smell

It's okay 
Suction isnt strong 
Entertaining but suction is bad and toy is removable from base 
suctions great but removed from base too easily 
Great idea bad suction.

Okay 
Seems fine but I don't use it 
Beautiful Highchair for (Small) Babies 
A little too thin 
more hassle 
Thin plastic like a stroller rain cover 
Works well not easy to store.

this is a round piece of see through plastic and it looks cheap on the floor 
Good size and love non-color 
Not what I ordered but will do the job. 
Nothing fancy

Looks Pretty but Doesn't Fit Toilet Well 
Fits only standard toilets. 
Good disposable cups.  Hole is too small. 
Too hard to drink from 
Can get clogged 
Great to have the screw on lid 
no different from my other bottles 
Liner is pointless changing pad is great 
Yellow Pad is really \Cornmeal\ 
Don't really need it 
Just OK. 
Ok but I wish they had a waterproof layer 
glorified washcloth 
Cute but not what I was hoping for.. 
So So 
Good quality

Edges curl after wash surface stays damp... 
Beware they aren't white and they shrink... 
Organic... but made in China? 
Not 100% Cotton 
Very small 
Should be called the 1/4 sheet saver 
great other than the pillowcase 
Good size pillow but need a way to close the silky pillowcase 
Nice size but you can't wash it 
This is a super small pillow! 
More like a pillow for dolls... 
Great pillow but the case slips off too easily 
Tiny pillow even for a tot! 
Not a game changer 
runs big 
frustrating 
High quality padding could stay in place better and be easier to use with buckles 
okay for the money 
Super Cute 
Cute but came broken 
what we expected 
Cute but overpriced 
Doesn't really glow 
Not as Good as the Other Avent Pacifiers 
Love Avent pacifiers but the night time one does not retain its glow at all 
Backfired 
Great Avent pacifier horrible \glow\ pacifier 
Too long 
Avent Freeflow Paci 
Frustrated 
Every  baby is different! This may or may not be the right one!!

Smooth flow but... 
Good bottle but slow slow flow 
not natural nipple-like 
Ended up being our least favorite bottles. 
baby does seem to eat more 
wide neck has been a drawback 
just okay 
Not the best for this price range 
Not for everyone 
I suppose I'll keep it 
It is Ok not as nice as I hoped 
Still like it but not as great as I first thought. 
Pretty and functional but won't last 
Review of purchase through Target only

Great warm cover for Chicco Keyfit 30 but works best for smaller babies 
For small babies 
this will do the trick 
great device but cleanup can be tedious 
Nice but not necessary 
Never used 
Please taste the water after it went through a  cooking cycle. 
So very close but not quite there 
Very easy to use but there is no sound indicator. Unsightly stains :( 
Expensive for what it is 
Not for Outdoor 
Almost a homerun 
Small but nice 
Great concept toddler didn't care for it 
It's OK 
Just OK for 2 year molars 
Such a weird design...still uncertain

Son won't use it 
It's okay 
My son didn't take to it 
Good idea but baby not Interested

Not incredibly sturdy 
Good but... 
It did the job but barely 
Eh not a big hit 
Smells good and soft on babys gums 
They're okay. 
Small and easy to hold 
Expected much more from Vulli products 
Not interested 
Good for the money 
Fits Great but really hard 
good for swimming 
Sizing seemed a little off 
Good for home use only 
Nice 
Nice product but too small for me. 
Cute and functional! 
Stain Easily 
babykicks 
great wipes but the tag is annoying 
soft and comfy but leak through when used over night 
ok for use at home 
Pretty good 
okay but prefer their 'fleece' ones 
They work but I've used better 
Absorbent but don't use Snappi fasteners! 
absorbent but not for small newborns 
Good and bad 
Really expensive.... we ended up using them sparingly 
good prefolds but don't work well with the snappis 
Absorbent but they shrink. 
absorbent but shrink 
I dont know 
Take em or leave em 
Doesn't hold much liquid 
Not Sure What I'm Doing Wrong 
Too wide for baby. 
These work..but they are very bulky 
Works well but leaves lint 
Fantastic for 2 years 
Updating from 5 to 3 stars - 2 main issues... 
Good but will interfere with Wi-Fi 
Monitor fine but Wi-Fi interference is a deal killer 
Not quite as plush as i thought... 
Bumper not as pictured :( 
Good 
Ok 
Not a fan 
happiness that was short lived 
Tray useless seat is ok 
My baby loves it but can't stay in it for too long 
Not so great 
what one child loves.. 
Not that bad 
it's OK but i returned it 
Super Seat 
Better than Bumbo 
the tray isn't too stable 
Good seat 
Summer Infant vs Bumbo 
Great as a chair for babies learned to sit up 
It's okay. 
A little disappointing 
Meh. It's ok 
good for the price 
Works but can be Dangerous 
Pricey not perfect but gets the job done. 
Wary of smell 
Liked these but found others I like better...... 
Good product but make sure it fits your bed 
Shrunk when I washed it 
Barely Gets the Job Done... 
Nice big bag but flimsy hardware 
Not as nice as expected 
Okay slipcover 
Works just fine 
Not very soft 
Nice cover right price wrong pattern 
Rough Thin Synthetic Fabric 
Not soft! 
Rougher fabric 
Not very soft 
Boppy cover 
It's simple and pink 
It's kinda scratchy. 
nice colors thin cover 
Not great! 
Cute not soft 
Doesn't help fix flat head just prevents it. 
much smaller than I thought 
Perhaps it depends on the baby but mine would fuss the moment I laid her on this... 
It's okay but recommend Mimos pillow 
So Far So Good 
My baby didn't like it 
Cannot be used for elder baby who moves a lot 
Don't want to give a star rating but... 
I use this pilllow every day but baby still has a flat head 
It's ok 
Great but not for carseat?? 
It's alright... 
smaller than anticipated 
Super small and uncomfortable 
Not sure if it is working.... 
Good product but make sure it is what you are looking for. 
I expected more!! 
Recommend for smaller heads 
HORRIBLE NIPPLE 
Too complicated 
why no replacement straws? 
not a cup for promoting independence 
Why doesn't Amazon let me specify a color? 
Definitely NOT the best 
Great sippy cups but read fine print. 
Too short. 
Maybe not for infant seats? 
Returned 
Too small 
Item Not The Same As Pictured Or Described 
Cute doesn't get a lot of use 
Ok not perfect 
it is probably a great product for most spaces 
Two stars off: advertised age specs are rubbish. 
Does what it needs to do 
A couple of minor issues... 
Works but small opening 
Gaps 
Eh 
Decent product 
not ideal 
Didn't work for us 
To the toddler Gandalf says \You shall not pass!\ 
Description is a little misleading 
Does NOT fit openings up to 40\. 
Decent for the price 
It's OK... 
Measure right... the gate is smaller than you think 
It's okay 
Nice 
Works great in narrow spaces with young children. 
Babies can open the gate! 
Didn't fit our space 
Not all that great. 
Decent for the price 
Not one-handed. 
Great price will do the job 
Serves its purpose 
Go with North States Supergate instead 
Great in theory 
works 
Got this to replace one I used for 1 year 
Decent gate. 
Its ok 
Just Okay... 
Alright but not Hard for Toddler to Learn to Open. 
Easy to install and use even for a two year old 
Does the job. 
Did an okay job 
Good but only good for narrow space 
Not great but not terrible 
Not bad if you get a good price 
Maybe ok for animals not that great for kids not necessarily pressure mounted 
Kind of short for a \super wide\ 
Cheap but Effective 
Great Latch Pressure mount could use work 
Does the job but could be more sturdy 
5 Stars for function minus 2 for a safety concern 
Serves it's purpose. 
Flimsy but works. 
Good cheap gate for a NON BUSY part of the house 
Great if narrow 
cheaply made missing pieces but easy to install 
It's Okay 
not for us 
you get what you pay for 
Just okay 
Ok but not great 
Does not very well. 
Its a bit flimsy but it serves its purpose 
Though it fit it was too stretched to be functional. 
A good option for those with pets 
Not my favorite 
Fine for certain situations 
Cute but some flaws 
Bought twice for both my kids more expensive second time 
My son likes it 
still needs some tweaking 
Simple Car Mirror 
This thing is ok but I wouldn't buy it again 
Great to Have But Doesn't Fit All High Chairs 
Gets the job done 
Covers the high chair. May not work with seat belts 
gets the job done 
Just okay 
Mat is small 
Just \alright\ 
Hot material 
BULKY HEAVY HOT POOR INSTRUCTIONS 
LOVE only for carrying a car seat -NOT FOR LATER USE 
Great and not great... 
Generally a good system if you don't use mass transit 
Mixed feelings about this stroller 
This stroller is okay 
Nice stroller don't leave it in the car. 
a little disappointed 
A little costly but the product itself is ok 
I could select just one color 
Works well but has drawbacks 
It isn't the best choice. 
First one: DAMAGED; Second one: a KEEER! 
Cherry color expect it to arrive damaged 
Nice crib but arrives with some damage 
Pictures a bit deceptive 
Awkwrad Height 
Good idea but I don't use it much. 
So far so good 
Great in Theory - I just hope it's working! 
Not Worth the Worry? 
I think it works? 
Not sure it's working 
Flimsy small and functionally suspect. 
Goes through batteries quick no way to verify 
Cute but not the most popular shower gift 
Clever but other products are cheaper 
A handly little sterilizer for the germ-phobic 
Battery Gobbler 
Not good for boys might work for girls. 
OK but has some issues. 
love the idea but 
works 
Use this if you don't need in the cabinet 
Keeps everyone out! 
Not a Fan 
Waterproof but still leak through to clothes 
Get the car seat cover instead! 
Washed and ripped 
nice product but prefer the heavier weight bundle me. 
Baby still cries 
Tried on my toddler but he hates it 
It works okay my kid still hates it. 
Eh It's ok 
Ehh 
aspirator 
im 50/50 
didn't work for us 
Just Okay 
Hmmm? 
Works ok but try the Zo-Li On-The-Go Travel Formula & Snack Dispenser instead. 
Somewhat flimsy 
Nice try but... 
Not bad for our toddler boy 
it is average 
Hard to use. 
A mixed bag. 
Both Good and Bad 
one leaked but the brand is good 
Not good for all babies 
I want to love this bottle but it has a major flaw. 
Not as great as I had hoped 
Still too fast a flow nipple 
Good idea but these are leaky 
Not As Great As I Hoped 
Helped with tummy time... a little 
My baby didn't take to it 
Noise Bomb 
Son likes toy better than me 
So-so 
Cute idea but kind of hard to squeeze 
It is too hard for a baby to squeeze. 
Kind of works for a 2 year old 
Haven't found anything like it! 
great use but not for their purpose 
Looks great not as functional as it could be 
pretty good 
Wheels don't work on carpet. 
Great until they start getting around 
Lacks Medium Flow Nipples 
Not as modest as I thought 
Baby still gets hot underneath 
Nice cover but hard to get on 
Get the latest cover instead 
Does its Job 
Snoogle Cover 
Seems ok 
Didn't do what I hoped but not bad 
Handy for travel but a hassle long-term 
bottles great liners suck 
Decent product but didn't like it enough to switch. 
I didn't notice a difference 
No air but still messy. 
Happy with the bottles but I did not get the bottles that are pictured. 
It's OK but would Supplement for gift 
Great for travel 
Sticking with Playtex non-drop ins ! 
Whatever you do DON'T BOIL 
Went back to regular bottles 
Nice Little Gift Idea 
These work great but be careful about temperature 
Decent Bottle Set 
To much for replacements 
Useful? For some people. Premium? Not so much. 
nice idea 
Lid isn't great 
Needs a better design 
Cute stickers but doesn't sticks very well 
Great design but very weak adhesive 
heavy toys pull off wall 
shape becomes distorted and as a result it will no longer stay suctioned 
Doesn't Stick 
Suction cups don't work in our bath 
Doesn't hold up after washing 
Grows mold! 
it's ok but it's the only travel wipe warmer I could find. 
Works great but only if plugged in 
Loved it in the beginning 
Came apart quickly 
Travel wipes warmer 
Great concept...cheap product 
A little too bulky for diaper bag. 
Thought this was an unnecessary luxury. I was WRONG. Great customer service. 
I'll take the good with the bad 
Keeps wipes warm is too bright 
it's ok 
A little damaged 
love and hate 
a luxury 
Good wipes warmer but cord broke after a year of use. 
Good but... 
Nice if it works 
Wish I had gotten colors 
Great concept not as visually stimulating 
Has some unknown sealant over the wood; baby never looks or touches it 
Baby doesn't care for it 
Not the Best Rattle Out 
Just ok ball 
Okay Ball 
Good concept but doesn't work well 
It doesn't suck it sucks 
Ok Product 
My baby not a fan 
Cute but not comfortable for me or baby 
Good but could use work 
Cute. 
2 Year old's favorite. 
Leak Proof but hard to clean 
Good concept but not has so many flaws 
OK But these Leak Easily 
It really depends on what you are looking for 
Adorable but VERY CHEAP design 
Flimsy but does the job 
Way Cute Way Expensive 
Not very useful but ever so cute 
Guard is great adhesive is horrible 
Great looking. Not very useful 
One serious design flaw when folding the G stroller with panniers attached and \closed\. 
ok 
Fall apart easily. 
Fragile but not impossible 
My son loves it I love it but be warned for the quality! 
Awesome... Till it broke 
Great Until It Died!  Now No Longer Available From Manufacturer! 
Fun but broke fast 
Best Bath Toy So Far! (UPDATE: oops......it broke) 
Tons of fun but sucks up batteries 
Fun toy for bath time 
Fun product - jury is out on quality... 
My son loves this! 
Cute Product- Impossible Packaging 
Protect furniture from leaks! 
Not Great for Cloth Wipes 
General review for wipe warmers 
Musty sometimes but still a good warmer. 
Heating part stopped working after 9 months 
Worked Fine but Never Used It 
Worked great until it stopped working 
Decent for a second carseat 
Safe seat compact size fun colors but difficult to use 
very cute but not of much interest to my 6 month old 
Weak Bell 
its okay but cheaper out there... 
Average 
Alright 
This is way too big for a first snack cup 
Very large opening is a stretchy fabric material 
Nice but too big 
Snack trap vs Munchie Mug 
meh.. 
Cute Idea - But! 
Not worth the price 
oversized... 
Loved it initially but it's going on the shelf until they're a little older 
Great if you like the padded shoulder 
good Product 
still learning 
Too hard to get the hang of for my taste... 
Not For Me 
Hmm 
It's ok 
This works for what I needed. 
Very cute but not too spill proof 
Not for me... 
Useful 
It's OK 
Okay but annoyingly long 
Adequate protection 
Isn't smoke colored it's clear 
It guards the stove but I have other issues with it 
Too rough! 
Just OK... 
Good that it is organic but very thin 
NOT SURE IT IS WORTH THE MONEY 
It works 
ehhh 
keeps kid safe...but hard to open 
Would not lay flat against the wall 
Its ok but the latch piece is inadequate 
Not bad 
Bulky and kind of low quality 
Best product I've found but not perfect 
Great...but 
Great while it lasted 
great idea 
Way bigger than it appeared 
Worth it if you need an extra once or two 
Good idea... 
Give it a few weeks to see if you really need it 
Huge! 
Good idea steep price 
Serves its purpose 
Ok if you really need it 
Not that useful as an exclusive pumper 
Good idea but kind of useless after the first weeks 
Great product but didnt really entertain my daughter 
Eh... 
Holds up for about 2 months 
Very nice material.  Zipper needs improvement though. 
Nice product but better to choose other prints. 
Great material fit not so great 
It tears but still works 
it's pretty but.... 
Only one packet - WAY OVERPRICED 
Still on the fence 
Ok wrap just never took to it 
Not for me 
Im sure this works for some 
Not for forward facing 
Not as functional as the other style 
Lid should come off 
so so 
depends on what you use it for 
Wish I'd Spent More 
Just OK and stopped working for a short while. 
Too many issues 
Very good if.... 
Not what I needed but very good product nonetheless 
Cost doesn't outweigh the benefits 
Enormous 
Boon saucer - works fine as a divider plate doesn't prevent baby from picking up 
Too small 
Slip-resistant but NOT flip-resistant 
What I need but not the best quality 
Good but smaller than BG 4.0 
I only use it when I run out of all my other diapers 
Could be better 
Good as occasional seat not great for twins 
it would outgrow 
Sort of meh but it works. 
useable 
slides around on table never used strap but sturdy and worked well enough 
It works... 
Look for another changing table pad 
Made in China - but serves it's purpose ;-) 
Summer Infant Changing Pad 
*REALLY* tight fit for the IKEA Sundvik changing table 
May not fit your changing table 
Good changing pad for a long time 
You get what you pay for. 
No necessary. 
Decent product but too big 
. 
love the belt 
Good enough for me 
Be Prepared to Need to Off-Gas This Thing 
It does what it supposed to do 
Good size and does the job should be cheaper 
Smells 
This thing is HUGE 
It's large! 
Smells awful 
Hard to clean... Don't use without a cover. 
Functional and easy to clean - installation is silly 
A little awkward 
Um it's ok 
Durable and cute but... 
Bendy Ball 
Uninterested 
Great ball but poorly named 
Baby doesn't like this toy 
okay 
Maybe Better for Younger Babies 
Not the same toy now than what I bought in 2009 
Too heavy 
It is well Made 
More suitable for older babies 
it's ok 
Never really held interest 
It's OKAY 
good and bad 
Good product 
average quality item 
cute.. maybe cuter for me than the baby 
Pretty good 
Disappointing for Baby Einsten 
Smaller than expected. . . but it's a bendy ball 
My nine months old enjoyed it for one minute really 
Very cute... but my 6 month old didn't care. 
Its ok 
Hard 
OK 
SO SO 
Not Very Bendy. 
Durable fun ball for baby! 
Interest level will very depending on baby 
Mediocre 
My daughter doesn't enjoy this as much as I had hoped 
Don't hate..but don't love it. 
Hazardous but my son loves it... 
eh it's okay. 
Small but cute 
nothing amazing... but maybe I'll appreciate it more when he gets a little older 
it's okay 
I don't see whats so great about this thing 
Its okay. 
I recommend a round regular ball. 
pretty good 
For a little extra room. 
Basic net... 
It's Okay 
Cute But not high quality 
hard to transition 
Can't Choose Color Baby Not A Fan 
... exactly what i was looking for but theyre not bad did get a girly color even though i ... 
okay... 
Awesome cups Anoying you can't choose colors. 
Good size for small hands but terrible spout 
Lid hard to line up 
Great cup 
Generic packaging 
Packaging is suspicious 
Broke after 3 months of use 
Slightly reduced power but works 
This is an OEM product 
It works 
Didn't specify voltage 
Stopped working after about 4 months. 
Great Price 
Packaging or product arrived with a strong floral scent 
Yes they do what they say but good luck getting them on 
Twin Mom in VA 
Great Idea but really hard to suck milk through 
Love the idea... 
Neat idea but hard to use 
Didn't work as expected 
not absorbant 
Decent Item - Nothing Amazing 
\Plush\ eh? 
Just ok.. 
Just okay 
Easy to pinch thighs in buckle 
Cute but not so sturdy secure 
Daughter never used it. 
Very Big 
Ouch 
no slip grip that bums me out 
My son loves Mickey so he wants to use the ... 
cute.. but only for 1 meal option 
No instruction sheet pilled after one wash! 
Great for Newborns Not for Bigger Babies 
Not the size depicted but can be pumped up 
Cute but not great 
Easy to keep clean 
Sort of does the job 
Trouble fitting on our older faucet 
Looks cute but.. 
Didn't really work 
Cool spout cover... but... 
Works fine but gets moldy! 
Will not work without a diverter!! 
Just OK 
Does The Trick 
Only stays on with shower pull! 
suitable for avoiding possible nasty collisions 
Three Stars 
Pretty Good but... 
Wanted to love it just doesn't work for us. 
Good idea doesn't work on my tub 
Doesn't stay on but is very cute 
Sort of what I needed 
1 year old can easily remove from spout 
Cover works but duck has hard protruding beak 
Fits loose on my spout... 
Cute but cheap 
Very cute 
It's ok 
Not good with short spouts 
Pricey for what it is 
Great if it fits right. Clearly not a one size fits all! 
Doesn't really work on extremely narrow spouts 
It works 
Why can't we choose our own colors? 
I'm torn.... 
Don't see (feel?) much difference 
Good if you have large nipples 
Wish they were softer 
Didn't work for me but the product is solid 
Great concept - very uncomfortable though. 
Didn't find them comfortable 
OK to help with pain from contact but not very practical 
Nothing Special 
Small hole 
Medela SoftShells Breast Shells For Sore or Inverted Nipples 
No thanks 
Works but troublesome 
Good bottles but leak 
Love the look 
Good if they help your baby with spitup/gas otherwise just a lot of extra cleaning 
Not the best out there for all colic cases. 
Great bottle- A lot of Parts 
ok 
i guess it's ok 
Rainbow mats are nice-but possible over-priced due to thickness 
Does the job but needs some fiddling 
Short 
Not as protective as I'd hoped 
Not bad but hard to fit 
Quality control 
3.5 stars 
Does Its Job But Smells Terrible 
if you can spare the money but not necessary. 
Does the job 
Very large! 
Covers rail but does not cushion 
Thin covering smelled for days 
over priced but it works 
Manufacturer Description??? 
The price is great! The size is not. 
another suboptimal solution 
They break 
it's good BUT 
Whether it works for you really depends on your breast/nipple type 
Dimensions provided are for the inner tube not the cup 
Picture is misleading but works alright. 
Low price = Low Quality Thirsties are better 
Ok 
An okay toy with not much to it. 
TImer is WAYYY too short 
Baby likes it but I don't 
Eh... 
good bowl but still made in China. 
Not bad for a door knob lock 
Worked for 6 months 
Varies By Door Knob Size/Shape 
Very comfortable not really absorbant 
Seems like a good idea... 
Not impressed so far with leashing my twins. 
and is said i would never use a harness... 
Just ok for my 18-month 
a little too small 
Replacing this before 7 months 
Non-Skid? 
Received Damaged Product Twice 
Change tables are good but this is basic 
Started out great... then not so much.. 
Good product 
Worked the purpose 
Very Cute But Buttons Kept Coming Undone 
Nto crazy about it 
ripped after two washes 
Not soft 
Ok sheets 
Good enough for Grandma's house 
Endlessly useful 
Great but not needed 
Leaks.... 
1 year old dislikes it but it is a great cup from my perspective 
Just okay 
Not easy to use 
5 stars for no-spill 1 star for shape 
too bulky 
Just Okay 
I know this is politically incorrect...... 
Bottom of cup too big for average cup holders 
but I do like the flexibility of the hanger 
INEXPENSIVE BUT RECOMMEND BUILTNY CASE 
Hard to open 
Ok 
Just ok... 
Definitely not for two pacifiers 
A little smaller than expected. 
Ok 
great plate with one major design flaw... 
Kind of small 
Great concept not for every baby 
crappy lid 
Nice and easy 
Gets the job done but not a good value 
OK but there are other less expensive options 
Works well but I've found a small conatiner that I like better... 
Wanted this to work 
Just alright 
Very soft sounds 
Fair buy. 
Very quiet 
Not loving it 
Step up from Graco but not sure it's \the one\ 
Didn't Work for Us 
Great idea but my daughter didn't think so 
I really wanted to love it&#8230; 
Woombie Swaddler 
Runs Small 
A little flimsy but serves purpose 
Doesn't hold baby's attention 
I like it more than the baby did 
Very cute 
Stuffing coming out... 
Skip Hop VS. Tiny Love 
Cute but sheds 
Large did the job 
Cute but the giraffe one works better 
Cool idea but hate the pacifier

My 2nd wubbanub. 
you need two 
Not What You Expect For the Money 
Frustrating for baby 
Very quiet and not safe for the older babies crib. 
very fun toy for baby 
Cute Idea 
Just Okay 
My son didn't take to this.. 
Too quiet 
I returned 
Too quiet kind of cheap 
Great if you deck it out with other toys. 
toy 
It's okay but my son loves it. 
Disappointing 
Ok but not great 
Returning it 
ocean sounds are soothing 
Simple yet effective 
Cute but only rocks 
So-so 
Would be great if it worked 
Pump is okay but not for me. 
decent for the price 
Not as big as i thought 
ok nothing great 
Cute Tote for Baby 
Hard to manually express/compress in this bra 
not for me 
Works well enough but don't love 
Nice to have but not necessary 
feels like the pumps will fall off (but they never have) 
Wasn't very comfortable for me but quality material. 
for my wife 
Good but you dont need it. 
size large is HUGE 
Just okay - not tight enough 
Doesn't really act as a bra but does hold the flanges in place (36DDD wearing L/XL/XXL) 
Does not hold well once you have some weight to those bottles 
You really don't need it. 
Good if you need it 
Returned it 
Difficult to take on and off 
more trouble than it is worth for me 
Does the job but not as useful as I hoped. 
works well not flawless 
holds flanges on by pressing against chest 
Dont waste your $$$ 
No lo necesitas realmente... 
It's just ok 
Does the job but stretches out. 
This is just okay 
Not for me 
inaccurate sizing 
Take It or Leave It 
Didn't really use it. Turns out I need to ... 
Not used as much as I thought just pop in your nursing tank instead 
Mixed Emotions 
Disappointed 
Fan is just \ok\ 
They're OK but Wishing I Got Something Else 
inexpensive- but doesn't last long 
Good but too small 
Draw string issues 
talk about large try 8x12 in. (piece of paper size)....what is small or medium 
Perfect as the \just I case bag\ for the diaper bag 
Good For Occasional Use 
Fine except for drawstrings 
They work 
Work well at first but don't wear well over time 
Just OK 
They are not my favorite 
What's in a wet bag? 
My son Loves it 
Good toy would like to be able to use music w/out the motion and vice-versa 
Fairly good entertainment for young babies annoying music 
Not sure about the spinning motion 
Seemed like a great idea but son wouldn't use them 
Beautiful product but he didn't like them 
Awkward angle 
Smaller than expected but seems to work. 
Seems to have an odd fit. Doesn't really wrap ... 
Works but kinda thin. 
Good for little kids not as good for big kids 
wears fast 
You get what you pay for. 
Nice but hurt my back 
PLEASE read this... 
nice crib but don't count on it being 4-in-1 
Crib is pretty good but does have a chemical smell when received 
Pretty and compact design but difficult to turn 
Mostly perfect. 
Will NOT fit (3) Avent Natural bottles... 
Perfect for bottles but nothing else 
Doesn't fit 3 Playtex Nurser Drop-Ins 
Nice until you get a hole in the ice pack 
Cooler for EBM 
strap broke 
Good fun but slightly poor quality 
Wish it worked! 
OK be ready for the light rattling 
sunlight is bad for retaining straps 
I love Munchkin products 
Its okay 
Needs some modifications to be great... 
NOT Made in USA 
It is pretty. 
Next time I'd get one with drawers 
Can't expect too much in terms of quality for this price. 
Looks beautiful but the drawers don't open very far 
Decent quality but not all solid wood 
drawers don't pull out far enough 
I thought this would be the one... Nope! 
Love the concept wish it was better quality material! 
Not good for babies under 1 year 
Major Cuteness Factor & Somewhat Decent Quality 
Well-made and stylish...but small. 
Its decent 
The footprint is nice but there isn't a great spot to put ... 
It's cute enough 
If I coul go back and get a new one I might 
This book is okay but since I've purchased it I've seen better. 
Nice baby book with printing error 
Daughter Didn't Like It 
just ok 
First solids bib fail 
Nice idea but my son hates it 
It's okay 
I liked the idea baby hates it 
Too small for 7 month old 
Not for self feeders 
Not a great design 
Not as practical as I thought 
Ok but a pain to clean and not a great fit w the Inglesia Chairs. 
Cool idea and look but not very accurate 
Cool but not much useful 
It's just ok 
Not accurate 
Cute but not exactly what we expected 
A Bit Disappointed 
It's New and Improved...but Not Quite There Yet 
Not the best high back booster 
Not great replacement for the toy I hought it for 
Styles May Vary is right! 
Decent for the price 
You get what you pay for. 
Pretty small 
nice but too small for a receiving blanket 
They serve their purpose 
Good for Burping but not to Swaddle 
Thin but useful 
Cute but fair quality 
Hum.. 
Blanket 
Small size

Be aware of size 
Not for us 
Works fine but the toys are the main attraction! 
Solid but has flaws. 
Great Product 
One good one bad 
Not sure why there are so many fantastic reviews - this is just OK. 
Unfortunately it's necessary sometimes.

Affordable padding.

Not very efficient 
Scratchy Velcro 
Really?

Not a pocket insert 
Okay 
So-So 
Not for kids under 3 years old! 
Decent for the price. 
Good Overall but Small 
a little small for kids 
They do the job 
Some mats only had 3 sticky sides! Argh!

Not what I expected and depends on your child 
Not use very often 
Too tight 
Wish I had tried this when baby was younger 
Nice product baby doesn't agree 
Just OK 
Brush is Okay Comb Sucks 
Saves Space

Food color does not go away 
It's ok 
not comparable to PIS 
Not bad.... 
Color misleading 
Looks great until lid falls in 
just okay 
Ok but overpriced 
Super cheap but does the trick 
Darker Color 
Modern and Clean 
Looks nice but pretty flimsy 
Prefer to spend the money on boon 
Soft and small for baby but not great. 
Needs better fastner 
Wanted to like it. 
Perfect for spoon-fed babies. Nightmare for self-feeders 
Island highchair- you need lots of space 
I wish this would have worked on an island 
It definitely has its pros and cons. 
Bummed Out 
Good seat but there are better options 
Wanted to love it but it has a few design flaws 
Won't be reaching for these... 
Alot to wash doesnt do much for keeping out the air 
was great at first now not so great. 
Great design but not for everyone 
Really wanted to love it but couldn't and neither did baby 
Save your money 
A+ customer service 
good idea average result 
I loved the MamaRoo; but my baby didn't... 
Had high hopes... 
Great Product Not for my baby 
Good but expensive for long term use 
Seems a waste 
We didn't use the extra filters yet 
Cute backpack useless \leash\ 
Good buy 
Looks good could use more padding. 
Heavy - better on its own than in a bag 
Child's legs get stuck in the rails. 
knotted toy 
I wish my baby liked it 
Baby not interested 
Thinner than expected

Works but not my favorite. 
Really thin and feels cheap.

Good wet bag but sometimes hard to close 
I wouldn't put dirty diapers in this bag 
It works

Compartments are good but plastic isnt 
Only for certain type of rearview mirror 
Good size easy to hold but they leak

Easy to use but doesn't keep the stink out 
Not as good as the old Diaper Champ 
Doesn't do what it's supposed to

Our son loves it but HELLO needs an on off switch. 
Found a way to turn off the music (thank God!) 
Baby likes it but it comes off suction

Use wherever 
Cute but simple

Toy removable from suction

Price is too high 
Ok but could get better for the price. 
Way large 
Not durable enough 
Comfortable flange 
Better than Paciplushie but not as good as Wubanub 
Cute but the hinge isn't as strong as you think 
Cute but probably not for older babies 
Too heavy for my baby 
Spill-proof but 10 month baby doesn't like it 
Made in China 
Not a fan of this teether 
Unusual Fit 
Latex version better for our little one 
Nice idea...

Made in China 
Made in China 
Bad photo 
Can't wash it! 
How to be fair on this review? 
It was a great idea but my boy just doesn't chew on it 
A little cheaply made- but does the trick 
Good and bad 
don't take away pain but helped 
Very comfy but not long lasting 
Guess its good if you need it 
never got change to use it 
comfy and helpful but pricey 
Works for Some but Not for Me 
Okay 
Wish they really were &#34;reuseable&#34; 
Small and misshaped after washing 
Towels? 
Not that useful don't last. 
Soaker pad is troublesome for newborns 
Love the cover Soakers are So-So 
Not as great as I thought...but not terrible. 
Absorbant but prone to mildew not ideal for newborns 
prefer the stay dry pads 
Not my favorite 
Prefer the \Stay Dry\ version more. 
22 months of cloth diapering. The Master List! 
Not a handsfree carrier 
It's okay 
An ok toy 
BONK 
6-month old loves it but be careful washing it! 
At least the broken spinner kind of rattles when you shake it... 
A bit hard for baby to hold

Soft light blanket

It's ok 
soft but huge arm and head holes 
Needs to be fixed

They're so so. 
Decent bags but don't last 
Good bags 
I regret buying this 
Work well but be careful! 
Just okay 
I honestly never used these... 
Great idea but tiny! 
Cute & well-made but still not that practical 
Good umbrella but irritating clasp to attach to stroller 
I like the design 
Good Idea 
Loved it when it was new but then it stretched out - 4 months in 
Dangerous Pictures! 
They would be great if they were just a bit taller. 
Nice toddler bowls but not 100% silicone 
Good but dishwasher detergent clings to them 
Useful colorful but ... 
Work fine but there are better wipes out there. 
soft but not good for poop 
Works... 
Blankets work just as well. 
Good for playground baby swing 
Not so enthused 
Good but not great 
Nice not the reflux miracle I'd hoped for 
It's not that special 
Just OK for me 
Good with reservations 
Love/Hate Relationship 
Convenient and comfy with my added insert 
short use 
A little peace of mind 
I feel a little ripped off! 
So not worth $32 
Muno with a Brobee tag? 
An ok diaper bag! 
Good from usage point of view but not in looks. 
Slide around in bra 
A mixed bag 
Not good under t-shirts 
Leaked Through Them 
not work as expected 
Good Product I didn't care for them. 
Doesn't stop major leaks 
Soft but shrinks like crazy! 
Not my favorite 
Comfortable but not absorbant 
Shrinks quite a bit 
Leak through 
so so 
soft but I leak through! 
Okay. 
Ok Pads 
Switched to disposable 
Ok for at home 
Pads work well but bunch up 
Good for overnight 
Wanted to love these 
great price nice product 
Does not absorb a lot 
Very Flat 
Soft but leaky 
enh. don't hold their shape 
. 
Soft - Easy to Leak Through - Doesn't Dry Fully in the Dryer 
They work but 
100% all natural cotton 
Very comfortable 
Very soft but not very absorbent 
Ok - not sufficient for high leakage. 
Absorbent but not thin 
Stick to my nipples :( 
Maybe in a few months. 
Just okay - won't keep the milk from leaking out for too long 
Very comfy but pretty thin 
Extremely soft 
I prefer the ones from Motherhood 
Milk leaks through it 
Reusable but get lumpy 
Not very good 
Doesn't work well with Bugaboo Bee. 
Bought these for my Bugaboo - works for grocery bags / other small bags but that's about it 
Not very good material 
good enough 
Good but know its limits 
Not what I had hoped for 
not my ideal stroller but great for the price. 
not as nice as the original 
Great Material but Cheap Zipper 
Great fabric bad zip 
Runs Large 
Wow big 
Very thin cheap zipper 
Expected higher quality 
Very thin. Not for those with A.C. 
Too Thin 
Baby seems to like it 
Tough call 
Comfy but impractical for diaper changes on the go 
Helpful but not perfect. 
ehh 
Works but....... 
to small for my son 
A bit cumbersome 
Good newborn option for the ERGO carrier - but hard to use 
Works but only used for a short time. 
It's just Okay... 
I liked the older design more 
Works well but is SO HOT! 
Not helpful with older newborns 
makes my baby very comfortable... until she gets too hot 
Good idea but too warm for baby 
Test it first 
A little clunky 
Not for me 
Did not Really Need 
Never used it 
Okay for the cost... 
Daughter loves it! 
It's ok... but I wish I had bought another one... 
There Are Better Exersaucers 
Kinda bulky 
Satisfied 
Stuck between 3 and 4 stars 
Genius product but not long lasting. 
Prefer the Simple Wishes bra 
Great if you have time to set up properly 
Good but... 
Not my favorite but gets the job done 
Works well but expensive 
Too expensive 
Easy on 
hard to get on but once on is good 
Runs small 
Buy a size larger than fits you before baby comes! 
Go up a size from the chart 
not a lot of support 
Order larger than you expect 
Good but not great 
works great - wish it had removable straps 
Does the job but not the most comfortable thing to put on. 
Runs small 
Nice product but it badly needs a hook at the ... 
Small and Awkward 
Great for hands free zipper is weak 
Up to 100 lbs? No Way!  Far Too Narrow in Torso 
She loves tags just not this Taggie 
Works as it should but breaks down quickly in hot humid climates 
Warms slightly 
It's OK... 
very good diaper but size up your child's clothes! 
Not bad 
Great Diapers! 
Love it in theory Hate it in practice 
Nothing special 
too baggy 
Ok better ones out there.... 
Smaller than anticipated. 
Okay for the price. 
Ok 
Can't use on its own 
Nice and soft but smaller than I thought it would be. 
Runs small snaps inferior to other pocket diapers 
Very difficult to adjust. 
Not terribly impressed! 
Still on the fence about this one. 
FuzziBunz is good but Flip is better 
Smaller than expected 
Just ok I don't understand the hype 
usable but nothing special 
Just didn't fit my baby---LEAKS! 
Good not great 
Leaks periodically 
Soft diaper 
I don't think these were FuzziBunz inserts 
Great idea just not very absorbant. 
Not terrible but not awesome 
Just OK 
Too big for compact spaces 
My baby loves it I don't like that she can get the sun battery pack out 
Solid play mat 
Wanted to like it more. 
Okay but not thrilling... 
OK but will never survive to toddlerhood 
Does not rock well 
Good choice 
ok 
Not what I expected. 
it is just ok 
Mine is not defective but my opinion? Eh; it's mediocre. 
Rock the Cradle 
Good for smaller babies 
Not impressed 
Will be useful when my baby is bigger but too tall fir him now. 
eh for my son... 
Good product...too bad my baby is still fussy. 
Just OK 
Perfect for the money but easy to trip 
Does the Job 
Nice chair but some issues 
Not a huge fan. 
For the price I expected a little nicer quality 
Agree not so much space saving here 
It's OK. 
Rolling high chair is still the best 
great for smaller infants/toddlers 
I like it but I don't love it. 
Not for fat babies 
This is cute but has some design flaws 
I prefer a cheaper version 
Earlier version is better 
Lost that loving feeling... 
Not as good as the older style 
It's ok 
Just OK 
It's Ok... 
Gets the job done 
This cover is okay but.... 
Elastis isn't forever 
returned. 
the tip part of this paci is really big 
wish it wasn't so hard to roll out the clay 
Was somewhat disappointed 
Push Hard To Get Good Print 
Hard to make it flat 
Not really a rattle 
Mehhhhh... 
Just ok 
Ok for a starting potty 
Wish this was taller 
Good basic potty 
Small and awkward seating 
It's cute but I wouldn't buy it again 
We like it but... 
Baby likes it but it could be better 
So So Rattle 
perfect for 4m-9m 
okay but overhyped 
For older infants. 
not the best quality 
Cute but not necessary 
Doesn't fit City Select nor City Mini double 
More pain than pleasure from this lock! 
its okay 
Good for Travel but not for Daily Use 
Good idea but not executed very well - still it has its uses 
Not perfect but not bad either. 
Great idea but not great in practice. 
Try before you travel - not for younger infants 
Definitely useful in a pinch 
Good choice for an emergency kit or your car not much else 
a good idea could be better 
Good for on the go. 
With some improvements could become a 5 star product 
Concept silly & wasteful in my opinion...but product title is fitting 
Convenient? Definitely. Recyclable? Only technically. 
Just OK - I prefer others 
Super cute...a tad too small 
Not soft enough for newborns 
Nice but not exactly what I thought it would be 
Just ok. 
Decent Burp Cloths 
Good but not great 
not as big as expected but nice material 
Dr Seuss on the Loose! 
Could be cheaper 
not for my daughter but appealing 
It's OK 
neat design makes it less valuable as toothbrushing training 
It's ok. 
Not bad start for teething remedy 
Okay but a magnet for dirt 
Baby loves it but not for young babies 
My son loves this! 
Good for early teething phase 
Daughter loves it but pricey 
Collects lint very easily 
Toddler version is better 
Keeps baby dry...but could make yourself 
you can just cut up some fleece yourself 
I'll make my own in the future 
OK product horribly overpriced 
Great idea but better to 'make' your own 
They work but they're thin. Not my favorite cloth diapering item. 
Helps with irritation 
Make your own & save money 
My baby didn't like it 
Not what I expected 
It's great only if your baby likes it 
Not for bigger babies 
Better for front carry than back carry 
Really wanted to like it but... 
Better than tape but not perfect 
Good if you don't want to \erase\ 
Can't erase the pink one - WTF? 
Not really one-size-fits all 
Too big. 
The bands are cute but the writing washes off FAST 
Good stroller. 
*UPDATE*~*~*~PROS & CONS~I LOVE IT BUT ITS MISSING SOME MAJOR CONVENIENCES~*~*~ 
Expensive and requires you to order more hardware to adapt it to most households. 
Meets Expectations 
Beautiful changing table but far from perfect 
Baby hates it... but he hates all nasal devices. 
My baby hates it 
It's alright

Some leaks

These blankets are ok but are a little scratchy.. 
Great 
Love the design but wood frame came apart 
Well made - wrong color 
Flow still a little too fast otherwise good product 
Not for Preemies 
Not bad not terrific 
Improvement needed 
Too small for rice cereal to pass though 
Haven't used much yet 
Not worth the price. 
Not organic safe Pla-Polylactide Fiber 
Just okay 
Best we could find but still just ok. 
will save us some black eyes! 
soft would work well if they actually stuck 
Nice fit easy to install... but be prepared to reapply adhesive 
Not a bouncer a good vibrating chair 
Heavy Duty Caps But Pricey And Likely Not Necessary 
Good Teether but my son wasn't interested. 
Pretty good 
material is not as claimed.... 
Must wash cold and I prefer snaps/zippers 
Hard to get baby into it! 
stroller with major problems 
Pretty good 
Disappointed 
After a few months trouble getting it to fold 
safety issues 
Not as useful as I'd thought it would be buy a Fisher Price booster instead

Stains 
The quality of these bibs are excellent no doubt 
Not worth the money 
My third choice of towels. It's ok not the best though 
I'm disappointed in Aden + Anais 
it's okay 
Not sure why this brand is such a hit. 
great washcloth/so-so towel 
LOVE the fabric but what's with the tags? 
The wash cloths are super soft...the towel not so much

Not practical for newborn. 
It barely fits my 4 month old 
Great noise reducer

It Works 
Not as good as Nosefrida

Better than a bulb syringe 
Can't complain at this price but has it's issues 
Fell out of love after a year 
Wish the included screws fit the TV 
NOT TRULY A 3-in-1 CRIB:  BUYER BEWARE! 
It's OK... 
Works great 
Did not work so well for me. 
bottom corners at center line are firm enough to scratch 
Flimsy but cute 
They are great in that they do allow you more hands free ... 
Replaced with a zipper one 
Order size down! 
Meh... 
Cute but runs big 
Buy one size less than you think you need 
Okay 
Just okay 
Great when you are out 
They're Okay 
Doesnt hold contents 
Very thin liners 
Good at what they do 
these are flimsy 
I like the concept but I can do without these

Kind of short! 
Didn't work and had to return 
Short 
Sits too low 
Lovely non-scratching design doesn't hold much. 
Great but very small 
Cool concept but too short 
Like other people say 
Sturdy but Not Tall Enough 
Not for rounded crib surfaces 
Serves its purpose once you get past the smell 
Great tub - did not last as long as I would hope.

Cute but retain water and mildew 
Nice for a while 
Bathtime fun

Great bowl but awful lid 
they're okay 
Awkard for left handers

Good for gripping but.... 
An Understated Look

Returning It 
Pluses and minuses

Ok- not that great value 
Great for short period of time 
not what I thought it was 
Wasn't as nice as I expected 
It works but pricey 
Just get the bassinet-sized pads 
Too small to actually do much 
Cute and handy! 
a bit small for diapering 
Small pads 
Should have paid more attention to the size 
These lap pads are small 
not waterproof?! 
Handy but very small 
Prefer the bigger bassinet pads but wonderful product 
Small and stiff 
Gets crushed easily 
Does the job 
Works Great but looks horrible after just 1 wash 
Too small for the bassinet cushion 
It would probably work for a bassinet 
Shrunk in the dryer 
Not thick enough! 
Just too big 
good but not my go-to 
Trial run great idea! Long term not so much. 
Ok--but pricey for how much you get 
Kissaluvs Lotion Potion 
Love the smell 
Works okay but doesn't smell the best. 
Good but a bottle can last you longer if you don't follow the directions! 
Not Sure if It's Helping 
Thick wipes for big messes (but not for delicate parts) 
No velcro closure 
Not my first choice for an overnight fitted 
It Would Be Great Except...

Three Stars 
It leaks but it's still better than plastic 
dimensions mostly good 
OK pillow

Disappointing as a swaddler but cute for other uses 
Soft but time intensive to swaddle 
Fabric doesn't have any give to it 
I like these but they aren't the same...

It's OK 
It gets the job done...

Not what I had hoped for. 
Stains WAY too Easily 
I want to love this

So-so Swing 
Good buy 
Helped send baby off to dreamland 
Affordable. Compact and easy to put together. 
No variability in swing speed music is off key 
This is such a great Spacesaver!  Good Buy! 
Nice compact swing 
eh just ok 
got our baby sick 
Skip it Get the Woombie 
Okay but Frustrating! 
The type with velcro wings is better! 
Too loose 
Wish I waited 
Newborn size is 5-10lb not 7-12lb 
Not for a newborn over 7LB 
Good sleep sack 
Good but not perfect. 
Wouldn't recommend for a newborn 
Too many strings 
Ok. Not Great 
Mediocre but Sufficient - You get what you pay for 
Ok 
Broke! 
Keep slipping off 
It's an okay product 
Good pacifier...unhappy with color choice 
Get the Medela Brand 
What is with the tops? 
It is what it says 
Very very soft--not at all firm 
My boy got scared of it 
Potential but didn't work great 
Okay Faucet Cover 
cute for the money 
keeps drawers closed removes finish 
Good basic book 
Beautiful Outside but I wasn't impressed with the inside 
Too Much...for a calendar 
Wish it had more stickers

Cute Calendar - if you use it! 
Nice big play mat 
Cute but not really supportive 
Good product but doesn't always work 
useless for my baby but nice product 
good idea but doesn't work that well 
Bulky but works 
Nice product but the width for the spoon and fork not practical for babies learning to feed themselves 
Yes it shrinks. 
Good cover terrible washing instructions 
Shrinks and twists with washing but usable 
A lot smaller than I thought

Ok 
Hole in the side of it after 4 months 
It's goodbut use other sizes more 
This takes forever to dry! 
Great materials ok 
Size SMALL is waaay too small... 
don't recommend small size 
Teeny tiny! 
TEENY TINY BAG 
Great design annoying to wash 
No hanging hook 
Fits a few diapers 
Only used occasionally 
Holds in wetness NOT stink!! 
Small? 
Item not as shown in photo 
The small is REALLY small. 
Leak Proof but not Stink Proof 
Will try another brand next time 
Needs a Loop 
Works great but a pain to wash/dry 
received different item than what's shown 
Small 
Great bag - small is SMALL though 
Very Small 
Underwhelmed 
Small for 1 cloth diaper 
Handle is already tearing off 
Smaller than given measurements 
Go with the medium 
Not as high of quality as the bag that I purchased before 
Snap on handle lost it's 'snap' 
Cute hold a lot but leak. 
yeah small.... 
Used for 8 months and leaks 
Just \OK\ 
You Get What You Pay For: Fell Apart While On Run

Doesn't fit the Graco snug ride car seat 
Comfy nice material 
Expensive but nice. 
Not sure if I think this is necessary~ 
holds straws in place 
Like the clip. Ridiculous it can't be ordered by color! 
Too wide 
Munchkin cups - edge is a little sharp! 
Very lightweight 
Just cups 
Too large for little hands to hold onto securely 
Ikea cups are better and cheaper. (These Munchkins are just OK.) 
Get the Nuby set instead 
Good for Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail 
Work Okay 
Not sure these do too much 
Love The Smell - Doesn't Do Job Though

Okay. Not fabulous 
could be better 
Expected more from Arm & Hammer 
Decent quality 
Not bad not great.. 
Nice product but needs improvement 
neh...

Decent Product 
Great concept; not as odor neutralizing 
UMMMM?? 
Not as handy as expected 
It's OK 
My son didn't love this book like I thought he would... 
Eh... 
Our son could take it or leave it. 
Just okay 
Serves its Purpose But you Need a Breathable Bumper 
Good size and quality but too big for trunk 
imperfections noted on the wood 
Waterballon 
Serves the purpose 
Works as expected 
Better than Gerber but not much 
Okay product 
Adequate Waterproof Pants 
Warning: Do not put in dryer 
Too big 
Great idea... 
Didn't stop the leaking 
Good 
Run huge 
Too big for tall and lean kids 
Better than in retail store. 
can't complain 
Good for price 
I wouldn't recommend this product 
it works but a measuring cup is better 
Eh... just OK. 
Works leaks a bit gets really hot not all bottles fit. 
Works But Is Difficult To Mantain. 
Good - not perfect 
Good but could be better. 
good heater but nothing special...do i need it? probably not. 
Can't clean...mold buildup/health hazard 
It's ok 
Expected a lot better quality for Dr Browns! 
Good warmer leaky 
Wish it was wider in width 
It's a bottle warmer.  Yeah. 
Works well 
Not really impressed 
Fine but unnecessary 
Very hard to get closed 
Disappointed 
Need the ability to choose color and re-order lids! 
Didn't fit a single door in our house... 
Did not work on any of 5 doors 
Didn't fit 
Doesn't Fit My Doors 
It worked great for me until my son turned 3 
Works but too expensive 
Affordable but don't rely solely on them for containment of children. 
Changing table is useless 
OK buy! Good stroller 
Short short short 
Cute but not the best 
Time lifesaver! 
works but... 
My baby loves it but.. 
Looks great but not functional (or safe) for infants 
Oddly designed and just doesn't beat my JJ Cole blanket 
Falls apart 
Burns not sure I like it 
I Loved It...but then it leaked 
Just OK 
Not our favorite sippy 
my kid never liked this cup and never would take a sip out of it 
It's the only sippy cup my daughter will use too! 
good product 
Handle Isn't Fixed in Place 
Great concept - wish it was dishwasher safe 
Nice...not perfect. 
Best caddy around but needs improvement 
Basically useless to us 
Bought it but didnt need it for car seat - great for Fisher Price Rock & Play Sleeper 
Seems to be sufficient 
It protects. 
glad i bought but 
Wish it was longer 
Cute but not quite as functional as I had hoped 
stylish large bag that doesn't look like a diaper bag 
The best but falling apart after 3 months! 
It does the job 
LOVE(D) THIS BAG! - Past tense 
It's not roomy enough.  Need More Space! 
Nice purse...less nice diaper bag. 
hot and cold 
Great idea but in theory. 
Good spoons but a little short 
Shallow bowl 
Better for play kitchen 
ok but not my favorite mei tai 
So far I'm not complaining 
Short-lived. Not good value for money 
Ok but flawed 
Ok organizer 
Cute design just not functional for us 
Nice night light but some design flaws... 
night light 
meh.. 
A bit too bright. Only red green blue for all night light. 
I like it but there are issues 
doesn't fit all tubs 
Works As Advertised But For How Long? 
This is actually the Carters Tree Tops sheet not Forest Friends 
Good but could be more robust 
Too soft. 
Stopped vibrating after 3 weeks 
It has suction cups (groan) 
As good as it gets I guess 
Suction cup does not stick 
too small 
Too deep! 
These are alright spoons 
ok i prefer softer spoons for really young feeders 
Ridiculously Long! 
Fine. 
Cute spoons but the spoon portion is too deep for 7 month old 
Spout needs to be replaced FREQUENTLY 
Not bad but not great 
No go for my almost 8 month old 
soft & easy to use 
Not great for us 
Get the job done 
Good daughter wasn't a fan 
There are pros and cons to this cup 
nice construction but doesnt fit well. 
cute but not what i was looking for 
I like other covers better 
Love them but too big for our 8lb new born. 
Not as big as I expected laminate is acquiring a weird texture - delaminating?? 
Okay liner 
Not as good as the Planet Wise 
Already had a hole 
Serviceable 
Daughter won't take them 
Love the Paci - hate the colors 
Nice drool control bib 
Scratchy material too big for a newborn. 
NOT unscented 
Prefer the newer version 
OK but a little dry 
Work well but they do smell 
So many better wipes out there 
Used to be good 
These are all right. 
Ok but wish they were wetter. 
Going with the thicker version next 
Wanted to love these but... 
wipes ok packaging not so much 
Very bad changes to these wipes! 
eh! 
not best seventh gen. product 
Mediocre wipes... 
Small dry and just not that soft... 
do not like their smell 
Decent 
wipes 
nice wipes a bit pricey 
Just OK 
EHHH 
A good unscented wipe 
Not so soft and gentle 
Could have been better 
A little flimsy 
So if these are \free & clear\ what does the scented smell like? 
couldnt use with a fussy baby 
Don't rush in 
Still prefer the traditional bulb 
Far too expensive for a marginally better product 
Works way better than bulb but.... 
Needs ventilation holes 
While it is a good idea and important for very young babies 
Only good for tiny infants 
Serves its purpose. 
Great patter Huge bag holds onto stink. 
Appearances can be deceiving 
My only complaint is how you have to wash it 
DId not hold up 
Sturdy bag 
Color Fades - Be careful how you launder it 
Great Idea 
Hold diapers but smelly. 
they work ok - the diaper dekor itself isn't great for capturing smells 
We loved this until my son started eating solids 
work but pricey 
doesn't hold as many diapers as it claims 
Expensive! 
Flex Nursing Sash 
It's just ok and the kid hasn't really taken to it much 
A good product but I don't think I'd buy it again 
Hard for baby to grip 
Recall?! 
Smaller than I imagined. 
nothing special 
Just ok 
Very Confused 
hard to hold 
Cute 
It's okay 
The Original Is Better 
Not good for newborns 
Kind of worked 
Soft but bulky... 
Soft cushiony but bulky 
Requires a lot of suction to work 
Great for home but... 
Not the best some leaking 
I like it but... 
Average kind of sippy cup... 
Doesn't spill but has a hard top. 
Leak Proof and Frustrates Baby 
Ok but son has no interest in using 
It smelled funny broke pretty quickly and made the water taste like chlorine 
Nothing really special... 
Definitely doesn't leak but hard to drink from as a result...... 
Cute cup but not spill-proof! 
Its OK.. 
Leaks a lot when tips 
It's ok.... 
OK but not great 
Pros and cons 
I really want to give these five stars but... 
Easy to use but mine broke after 5 months 
Not as easy to grab like Playtex ones. 
just okay 
My son loves them but they crack 
Ok 
Ok cup 
Work pretty well 
Good in concept 
Didn't work for me 
Too fast. 
for bigger tots 
Not Bad But Not The Best Either 
Good thought behind this but toddler won't use correctly 
It is a cute cup but not so good for training cup. 
Good cup but needs to be more durable 
Okay cup 
Too Much Flow 
Didn't quite work as I thought. 
design needs work 
Some flaws but OK 
sippy doesn't work 
Something my toddler will probably \grow into\ using 
Cup is ok but son refuses to use it 
Oxo Tot Snack Cup is Handy but Limited 
great idea.....difficult to open 
Good but the top can easily pop off and cause spills 
Lunch box size for adults but not toddlers!

OXO Tot Large Flip-Top Snack Cup 
Cap design is flawed 
OK.Plate 
lids comes off easily 
Nice toddler plate 
nothing special 
I really want to love these bowls but... 
Good but... 
Fine for me not as much for her 
Food falls out 
Not worth it. 
Great for baby food 
Good a little too wide for baby's mouth 
Spoon is too deap 
too big 
Too wide 
Usesless Fork....decent spoon 
good size for little hands 
A little disappointing for OXO 
Nice but wear out in 3 weeks 
I was expecting a little more from an OXO product 
Eh 
Wears out quickly 
Looks nice will probably have to buy again eventually 
Rusted after 6 months of use 
Good Brush Bizarre Nipple Cleaner 
Wearing out after one month 
Soft nice bristles HORRIBLE nipple cleaner 
Goods and bads 
It's Okay. 
Great Except Three Things - Needs To Be Replaced Sooner Than Other BOttle Brushes 
Great brush but already showing signs of wear 
Love the bottle brush dislike the nipple \brush\ 
Eh it's alright

Good quality but difficult size 
Keep looking

Nipple Cleaner? 
Brush is okay nipple cleaner is pointless 
I Expected Better from OXO

Hard to wash the thinner necked bottles 
Decent brush

Annoyed with the nipple cleaner 
Nipple cleaner ripped my bottle nipple 
Just a regular bottle brush!

For the money its great 
Just OK 
Nice size changing surface 
not perfect 
meh 
Nice changing pad but bigger than I expected it. 
It suits our needs but... 
Great fork bowl and plate not the spoon 
I like it...except it stained 
It's nothing special 
Why do they make this without a good seal?  Spills breast milk very easily! 
Don't like the lid 
Three Stars 
Maybe I should have just gotten an Ice cube tray 
Doesn't seal tightly just get regular trays 
Wish the lid was air tight 
Using for another purpose 
Does what I wanted but not as well as I'd hoped 
Doesn't quite fit 
Good basket just big 
Don't Use this Much 
It is OK if you use it. 
Okay 
hard to fit a lot 
easily fits in dishwasher but can collect grime 
You can take it or leave it 
Okay 
Not as comfy as I would like

Nothing Special 
More comfortable when worn alone. 
Not for me 
Love the product but One of the legsis wobbly

Okay I guess. 
Inexpensive easy yet unattractive solution. 
A temporary fix 
Big but ghetto.

Mixed emotions

Fine for face wipes 
color dye runs

Some problems. 
Well designed

Love the print but the snaps need work 
Decent

Not as impressive as other Benefit products 
Works great if you use Mineral conealer for your eyes 
Don't get all the fuss 
Good for moisturizing; does not illuminate sheer coverage 
Did ok 
Unimpressive as foundation substitute. Holds promise as foundation primer. 
Odd product 
Seems to Work but Don't Expect Miracles. 
I'm giving this 3 stars but please read...

Mixed feelings on this one

Works well for certain kinds of blemishes. 
better than hands but not effective enough 
Mehhh. Just OKAY 
Ok 
Ouch 
Works if you have a certain type of skin / pore 
Doesnt get out tough whiteheads 
Excellent doohickey 
Not great for really small blackheads 
Don't like the smell. 
No sharp edge 
Not as sharp as I thought 
kinda big 
I need something with a little more of an edge. 
Pretty Good 
Zinc may not be for everyone. 
Okay...without makeup

It's fine I guess. 
Nose Smashed 
Sure it will work

Avg brush 
The ingredients are very harsh

Not recommended.. 
Not worth the money for my use. 
Better than any Sally Product 
Ok I guess 
what can I say 
Teeny tiny. 
Almost satisfied 
not like my old ones but still ok 
Would rather have all larger rollers that are streamed. 
Old-fashioned electric rollers 
Used to be the best but the formula has changed in the past year 
Not bad but somewhat disappointing overall 
Never wants to come off! 
The brush is too big 
Why does everyone like this product? 
Lovely mascara not so lovely brush 
More cons than pros equals barely average product. 
Hmmmmmm...its definitely not for straightening your hair from poofy to silk straight 
It's ok 
Good for length not so much for thickness 
Works but was hoping for perfection 
Not sure 
Can't really tell 
might not buy again 
I like it

Smells Great 
OK

Not as bright as I thought 
It's not as great as other rating stated. 
Ok but not great 
Very disappointed in this product... 
Nice nails.

Obagi 
Still thinking about this one 
Still trying it 
Highly recommended just not for me 
Burned my Face 
It does good to even out darkness 
Does not glide on as smoothly as I hoped it would 
Good if you are not using water proof makeup too expensive

candy and flowers 
good price 
Cannot complain too much 
This shampoo is ok but  not great 
Smells great! 
Good but take precaution 
It's just another loofah! 
Not quite the soft pouf I wanted but high quality item 
Just ok 
Typical loofah but the cord is a bit annoying 
Exfoliates well but more suitable for the body 
Haven't used Yet 
meh 
Not worth it 
Lovely Smell 
Worked For My Hair At First 
Greasy.  Not conditioning.  Pass. 
A good blowout spray 
It's a Clip 
Does the job 
Good hold but the hinge can pull out your hair! 
Kept hair up but pulled it out too 
Not so great for bigger sections of hair 
Do the Job 
Not the best.... 
Some of these work great others leak 
They work 
Okay 
mmm I wouldn't call it a miracle... but it's ok 
Bulky Dryer 
Nice product 
Okay but not as good as a flat iron 
Results May Vary Between Users

A flat iron is easier..... 
Heavy Hairdryer 
Stylish but takes practice. 
Smells Great! 
Ok but not invisible 
Matches skin tone but on the fence... 
It's ok 
Excellent wear.  The color does not come out like it looks in bottle. 
very lightweight 
Decent straightner but you get what you pay for 
There's good and bad... 
a pretty unit... 
Good but not for a 1st iron... 
heavy yet underpowered in both heat and velocity

Good quality product but didn't perform the way It hought it should 
Just as nice as can be... 
Good sponge but a little rough 
Soapy 
Not the greatest

So So 
It is what it is..probably just me 
It's nothing special... 
Was not tightly sealed. Got all over my clothes. 
Too filmy and light 
Gets You Clean Leaves Your Shower Stall Dirty

Not for acne prone skin 
May be a LONG term effect thing?

Well... 
too small 
TINY but works... 
Better than I thought but sad it's SO small 
Hard to see myself

Maybe I'm using it wrong... 
Ok 
A bit disappointed 
I had tried another one without the spf and liked it better 
Good coverage but... 
Ok product STUPID BRUSH 
Right color 
Disappointed 
I bought this thinking it would be good to carry in my purse

It seems good. 
smells terrible 
Stinky 
Works but... 
Soothes painful ears -- but not for sensitive noses! 
Good color lousy consistency. 
Odd color but I like it. 
Just OK 
Not as great as I expected.. 
Not sure now 
Couldn't tell if it worked 
Too many chemicals! !!! 
Works well not fond of scent 
reddish brown did they say? 
It's too brassy 
LIGHT brown? Maybe later but not at first! 
Not any better than a regular dryer 
Nice concept but still needs work. 
Works well but... 
Limited use hairdryer for long hair only 
Great Comfortable Dryer But Not a Fan of the Attachments 
Average Hairdryer - accessories unnecessary 
Great Dryer...Lose the Cartridge 
Heavy duty blow dryer but that's it. 
A Dryer and Hair Conditioner Into One 
Not really for short or simple hair 
LIght weight... 
Great dryer don't care for the conditioner 
Say No... To Wax Build-up 
Just an ordinary dryer but more expensive! 
run of the mill straightener with a few problems. 
OK but needs improvements 
Cool functions - useful attachment - not the most powerful straightener. 
Conditioner: Good idea in theory - bad idea in practice 
SO-SO FOR HER

it did a decent job 
It's fine for the price 
Not impressed with this straightener.

Unpleasant smell 
Okay 
What happened to this product?

Not as emollient as expected 
Of the 3 Total Moisture scents this one is my least favorite 
Mild light and inexpensive lotion.  Good for general light use for slightly dry skin. 
Underwhelmed 
Dove Cream Oil Alright for the Price 
Hmm.. 
Wrong Combination 
Less scented but not unscented 
Contains FRAGRANCE 
Product is okay but packing leaves much to be desired 
More lotion-like than body wash 
Very Little Lather.. 
Nice product but scent could use some work. 
There Is No \Burst\ 
Will stick with Deep Dove Moisture 
Decent moisturizer but it smells like a 1970s aftershave

So-So

Mostly natural ingredients but an unusual scent and low sudsing action 
Very mild low sudsing light scent 
the smell is bad... 
If you really want natural...go organic

it does what it says it'll do 
its alright 
A good help 
Helped with waxing

Gritty and rough on the skin but they still work okay. 
Interesting sponges 
Not what I thought

beware product may be old 
Built-in brush application is messy 
not bad 
meh... 
Creases!! 
Don't buy from Kiosks 
Do not buy from Kiosks 
INACCURATE ingredients--\natural\ is a total misnomer 
Need to use it for an extended period

Good product but..... 
Its ok. 
Worked OK but Left Scalp Incredibly Dry 
Made my cat sneeze 
Pantene Volume Shampoo 
Another shampoo 
Nice shampoo better for normal to oily hair

It's ok it but won't order it again 
Not exactly what I was hoping for 
first time using any kind of setting spray 
eeh..? 
Still don't know exactly how this helps 
Not bad but doesn't really do the job 
Not as good for long hair 
Impossible not to burn yourself 
BUT 
Good tool a little hard to use 
Not good for fine thin hair and clumsy people 
Too small for big waves if you have long wavy hair 
Not for Short Hair... Not Really for Long Hair Either 
Need help to use this well 
I use the facial cleanser and this moisturizer 
Not what I expected 
NOT what expected 
Like/Dislike

It was nothing special... 
Alittle disappointed

Not a Moisturizer but a Primer 
My mom-in-law likes it but be aware of ingredients 
Just OK 
Who knows ? 
Just Okay... 
\primer\ = moisturizer 
No difference 
okay but not what I expected... 
Not so Great Liner 
I wish I could give 10 stars after using it 1st but it does not do anything to my face after using for a while. 
Might work for you didn't for me 
Harsh 
Good for puffy eyes!!! 
My purchase. 
Nice colors 
Slow but Eventual Progress 
This is ok 
Unsure how to combine with a commonly prescribed Rx topical 
Don't expect dramatic results 
Works ok but smells like furniture polish. 
eh 
Still can't figure this one out 
Not sooo gut but useful 
it's alright 
Good as a sunscreen not so much as powder foundation 
Smells terrible! 
not the same colors 
It's okay 
It's a waste. 
Fun Practice 
Smells great but doesn't last 
Great Product...packaging was okay... 
Love the array of colors...but the payoff not so much 
Queen Dija 
it's okay 
Not really pleased with it. 
Good Brush Be Wary of the Two-Pack Though!

Love the colors not so happy with the quality 
Love the colors however.. 
Unknowingly Matte 
shake em up! 
so-so 
Great product for extra dry skin 
Decent 
Lack of scent nice shine

Delicious scent and stays on but the color not as pretty in person 
nice color 
Uhh.. 
good color 
Not so great as I expected but kinda satisfied:) 
Another pretty color but... 
So so 
Stains way darker and doesnt last all that long. But NOT bad. Good price. 
Does what it promises but not for the price 
Takes Time 
Not to Sure About These 
Comparable to Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner 
Not as I imagined 
Worked ok 
Not sure 
Like a literal marker 
It's an okay eyeliner for begginers. 
never again... 
well? 
It seamed expensive 
This is so embarrassing 
Was Good While It Lasted.... 
So many duplicates! 
Just okay for a travel set 
its ok but not for someone practicing with make up

On some nights it comes off 
Undetermined 
Nothing Special

If you're looking for long wearing mascara 
Not falsies..just mascara 
Not impressed

There's a catch 
Clumpy 
Mine looked awful 
Love the curvature in the brush 
It is good but don't over do it.

Its allright. 
Good but not the best. 
It weighs down my lashes 
Can't deliver on its promises. 
ok...ok 
Super Thick 
Color is Pretty goes on very thick!

unusual color for a holo is its only saving grace 
It's okay 
Buy Color Club Instead 
Pretty but not as shown 
not bad 
Not so special 
It's OK 
Too thick 
Pretty good... 
Great ingredients but I've found better overall 
Not for the fair of skin 
Wanted to keep using it... 
I haven't used this long enough to give a fair review 
Not as it used to be :( 
Worked for my Mom not so much for me 
Okay

It brushes your hair 
I used it on my Weave and on my hair ... 
Expected more 
OK 
Moisturizer or Conditioning Mask? 
Uuumm?

Not bad not that great either. 
Liked the Old Formula Better 
My disappointment was a surprise 
OK conditioner weird curling results 
Good shampoo overall price is too high 
I can't tell the difference 
Unfortunate use of silicone 
Not as unique as claimed 
Average results at best 
Ok shampoo for curly hair 
My hairdresser knows 
It's Alright 
A fine shampoo but don't put too much stock into the \smoothing\ claim. 
Just Average 
Not Really For Me 
OK shampoo but friz control isn't great 
Not impressed...it's like a 'normal' shampoo. 
Not the best 
Can feel a difference in the DRY summer air 
There are better Pantene's out there 
Thick means your hair cuticle course hair not if you have typical thick hair like a lot of hair cuticles! 
Just an average conditioner 
OK BUT NO DIFFERENT THAN USING REGULAR PANTENE PRODUCTS 
dissappointed. 
eh 
wish it was brighter... 
Illumination is heat generation 
It's okay but the light is too bright 
hard to use doesn't foam much 
Off-color 
Just okay 
actually messed up my back with this stupid hook 
works but caused breakage with my brittle hair 
Won't Stay Put 
NOT QUITE WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR

To Be Determined 
kinda medicinal 
Sunscreen 
It's just 'okay' 
Good Product Bad Packaging 
Pretty Good 
It did its part 
Almost perfect 
My 8x counter-top is about the same 
Sticky Shampoo 
Black Castor oil shampoo 
Redkin is the best... not sure about color extend... 
It works just a bit pricey 
More like a body spray.... 
Have used it 3 times 
does nothing to hormonal acne 
Insanely Black tanning lotion 
New to tingle 
Love it except for one ingredient. 
Ok 
Bought for a friend... 
GEL FLEX TOE STRETCHERS 
I like the older Noxzema better this one causes slight burning sensation in sensitive areas 
Nice smell but way too overpriced for doing practically nothing. 
Good product a bit too pricey for the size 
Thin texture 
Not much results but no alleric reaction. 
Dull 
Too light 
Very sheer 
Looks nothing like the picture 
Its ok 
This set is ok 
ok 
Neutral 
It's okay 
being young would be better 
Works bad packaging 
Lightened dark brown to medium golden brown. 
Didn't really see results 
Worked but burnt my skin 
cuticle kit. 
First Impressions 
The size of the product is injustice to its price 
Just Ok

Passable but Could Be Better 
Lashem

OK but not great. 
strong smell - oily 
it is what it is 
Not sure about this 
Nothing out of the ordinary 
Original Hyalaronic Acid Serum 100% 
Is it 100% 
Does The Trick! 
??? 
What's the big deal? 
Not sure it helped my skin. 
OK FOR PRICE 
Smooths 
Hmmmm 
Not Bad 
it is what it is... 
Verdict Still Out! 
Zit zapper 
Didn't notice much change 
Greasier than expected 
Scent doesn't last 
Good but not great. 
Good moisturizer but the Blood Orange scent is nicer 
Somewhat dissappointed 
Smells nice feels cool 
it works but I think I can do better 
Good soap great scent 
Very tiny 
Smells great runs not very long lasting 
Wanted to like it... 
Pretty but.... 
natural but not a lot of staying power 
Okay Bath Brush 
It's okay 
A Note On Color 
Great color...however very messy! 
Quite nice 
I didn't notice any improvement 
It does what is does 
An OK mask and scrub 
it's decent 
Good mask for acne prone oily skin 
Pretty good; not blown away 
ok but nothing special for the price 
work decent but why the parabens? 
Good moisturizer but makes skin shiny. 
Sex In The City 
It's ok 
Ehhh 
Great price 
Smells Great...Controls Shine 
Not what i had hoped 
I thought this was awesome but.... 
Not accurate grits 
Matte not moisturizing but good coverage 
It works like a charm at first. 
So-so but... 
On the fence 
love the color. 
Barbie would be happy 
eh.. 
Helps but not dramatic 
Hard to hold and get leverage 
No complaints this is a pretty generic product 
I bought the day and night brightening lotions and 
The colors all get mixed 
very very small 
This product is very small good for nail art 
Tiny super tiny but not bad at all... 
It's Okay For The Price 
Not what I pictured... 
Gets the job done 
Not 1200!!! 
The product does not stay in your hair until washed ... 
Gloppy. 
It will do 
Color is more purple an I thought 
Light light grey 
literally \clearly\ pink 
On the fence 
Very sheer 
The color is not what I expected 
Not my favorite color 
Sheer 
Ok but..... 
Hard to apply 
Love Shellac 
Iced colors a little more \troublesome\ 
It's not you it's me... or my skin tone... or something... 
Good polish 
It's ok 
Not enough product for the money. 
thanks! :) 
Not for tightlining/waterlining 
boring black-blue 
Meh. 
Good at first but... 
Worthwhile if you do NOT have sensitive skin 
Not yet sure if this is going to work for me 
It May Work.... 
Pretty Happy with Eyelash Grow 
Couldn't continue use due to itchy lids 
Couldn't tell a difference 
Just okay. 
Iritating to the eyes for what little difference it makes 
Not A Product For Me 
What price beauty? 
Very slight difference 
Good luck if you have the patience 
The \caution\ statement startled me 
Not a big difference 
I wish I could say more... 
OK.. 
Too Soon To Say 
I was allergic but like the idea of a non-Rx lash grower 
After 6 weeks a bit more growth 
More a conditioning product than a growth product 
Must take time . . . 
Envyderm Eyelash Enhancement 
Ok for a Non-Rx 
Not sure if it works or not 
Is it worth the price? 
Not bad but nothing great 
Irritates sensitive areas 
Just ok 
Not the worst but would not buy again 
Where's the Carrot? 
Yes To Tomatoes Conditioner 
Compliments the Shampoo Nicely 
Too heavy for my skin and seems to take forever to be absorbed 
Not for me 
Not for my skin type 
MIght break you out still trying to decide 
Yeasy to put on the eye 
Just Okay 
Not my favorite 
Yes to Tomatoes 
Smooth texture seems to work well enough for some things

Halfway Pure 
I expected more 
HAVE USE IT AND HAVEN'T SEEN ANY NOTICEABLE IMPROVEMENTS 
Ewwwww the tangles and matting!!! 
its ok 
useless 
Good enough for lghter skin ..\ok \ for black girls 
For a little thing... 
Not alot of power but PERFECT travel size 
Works great and thankfully they changed design a little 
It's ok not great 
Kind of disappointing to be honest 
Lightweight moisturizer but not for all skin types 
I liked the product but not the smell 
Light weight & Sunscreen Coverage = Modrate Moisturizing 
Average quality moisturizer 
a bit too thick for my taste 
GOES ON SMOOTHLY 
Okay for sunscreen. Not my favorite moisturizer. 
Not what I expected but still good 
OK but not better than my usual 
Good moisturizer 
Does its job 
Good for what it's worth 
Great idea!

Planet Waves Pro Winder String Winder and Cutter 
Good tool 
Good all rounder 
Good but not excellent... 
It's not too bad. 
Hate the pushdown bottle heads! 
Not necessary 
I guess this works but it's kind of a pain to use. 
Great sound but fickle quality 
Hard on the fingertips 
Ok strings 
Take Good Care of Your Strings and They Will Last Longer! 
Sound good but not worth the extra cost 
Honesty is the first key in marketing 
NanoWeb stay clean but 
Great feel and handling but not the sound I like 
bad ears 
they are ok 
Underwhelmed 
Not very impressed so far 
Good concept 
ehhhh 
Make sure your control plate fits 
Improper Wiring Diagram 
Fender vintage tuners 
looks good but..... 
Requires drilling 
Maybe what you really need is a new set of strings... 
Hard to install 
Be careful about using capos like this because if you're using a fine guitar 
a little iffy 
it's just ok. 
Second best.

Works alright but has some flaws 
Flimsy blade construction 
NOT BAD 
Great for small tasks but didn't last a year 
It's a chopper / grinder not a food processor. 
A chopper not a REAL food processor 
It woks so-so 
Good but not as economical as rolls 
save your money order the rolls and specialty items 
The product is great but I'm not a fan of the company 
really thought it was a much bigger roll 
Expensive 
Mis-Leading Size Measurement 
Excellent! 
scratches over time 
product quality good but ivory color not

Pretty but average 
Good product - but don't buy white 
Poor results for baked goods 
Definitel worth over a hundred bucks... 
Old Fashioned way to spend money 
It's difficult to wash it since it's narrow and long.  . 
All glasses are not uniformed 
Beautiful and Functional 
Used to be the best...now a little to be desired 
Doesnt Swing but opens cans well 
Handle grips fall off 
Shame on Amazon!

Solid and Functional but what have you done in the last 50 years? 
Pricey! Great for Spices 
Can't reuse 
attractive but tempermental for canning 
Great vacuum... but so far don't like the bagless/hepa combo 
I thought Hoover was the best? 
A mixed bag 
Too noisy for my taste 
LOUD 
Still undecided 
didn't notice a difference 
This model not worth the extra cost. 
Jury's Still Out 
Not The Fan To Get For 90 Degree Temps!

It is a Poor Substitution for a Double Boiler but the Best one I've found for Cheap 
Nice but difficult to handle 
THESE ARE JUST OKAY 
Burned part of the holder Lodge Striped Hot Handle Holders/Mitts Set of 2 
not so special mitts 
Useful but not as good as they used to be 
Okay buy 
Prefer the sillicone ones... 
Good fit decent value should be more heat resistant 
Ok but... 
Not so hot 
Well made top quality but... 
Small for ends of pots and pans handles 
silicone may be better? 
Doesn't Hold 13.25# Turkey 
Observations using this roasting pan. 
A bit thin 
Lighter weight than Grandma's roaster! 
Chipped after two uses 
it is not the quality your mom's one had 
MADE IN MEXICO NOT USA 
Cheaply made compared to the older models. 
Manufacture defect have to order another.  sigh... 
Pretty lightweight for a roaster

You get what you pay for 
Not much to say. 
Not Exactly \Universal\ 
i am sure filter is ok 
Works somehow loud and inconvenient 
These ARE NOT original pre filters 
Depends where you buy it 
The item is fine but... 
Works as advertised 
Good enough for light jobs with some disadvantages 
Needs Some Tweaks To Make it 5 Star 
Half good - Half bad

Awkwardly shaped 
A workhorse but buy the one with the loop... 
WRONG ITEM 
Stainless can pit 
Do not use as a sauce pan (use only as a saucier) 
all-clad construction but bad engineering 
Not \fit\ for my pan 
Looks over function -- right here! 
Heavy for daily home kitchen use. 
I like 'em (now) 
Super Nice- Doesn't Grip well 
it's so sturdy that it's too heavy 
It's Quality BUT!!! 
OK but expensive and needed to return 1st set 
Works but Does Not Get A Lot of Points for Design. 
Purchased because of the reputation 
Does the job but hard to clean 
A fine example of a nonstick grill pan - but nonstick grill pans are a flawed concept.  Also - it's not \clad\. 
Not LTD but decent for aluminum 
Not \LTD\ as shown tho decent 
Smallish cooking surface and not great on smooth cooktops 
Perfect for bacon perhaps

The Picture is Misleading 
Lids don't fit! 
Lids lose their seal quickly 
Bowls are small can be used to serve to 2 persons MAX 
Glass storage 
Lids Leak - Not Airtight - Lid is Flimsy 
If only the lids fit snugly 
Updated Review 
Decent set could do with better quality lids 
Great bowls awful lids 
Adequate 
Alright 
Very good but slipery when taking it out of the oven 
Smaller than I thought 
Can't get the lids off without spilling 
Nice 
A few changes could improve this line 
I had to struggle with the lids. 
RECTANGULAR lids LEAK!! 
Lids Leak 
Good and not so good 
Great dishes but putting the lids on the bowls is hard! 
They broke upon arrival! 
10 pieces includes the lids actually 5 storage containers 
They are ok 
great until you break them 
Glass containers are great but some lids don't fit well 
Chipping around the top rim. 
I used to swear by Pyrex - maybe not so much now! 
inconsistent lids or glassware 
A perfect assortment

Jarrow Formulas Resveratrol Synergy 
Like this product but worried that it has less resveratol 
Not much Resveratrol in this formula 
contains little Resveratrol 
how to check for results of this supplement? 
Should Be Called \Synergy\ 
Good combination but dosages are low 
I'm no nutritional expert but 20 mg of Resveratrol seems low 
Placebo? 
Has some decent antioxidants but label is a bit misleading 
No Harm in Trying 
Poor Name Choice 
Pass - the dose is too low for me 
Not Much Resveratrol - Some Green Tea Grape Skin and Grape Seeds 
Great for my circulation 
No Side Effects small dose though of actual Resveratrol.. 
Jarrow Formulas Resveratrol Synergy 
good stuff but what's in a name 
Read The Label! Does It Provide Expected Dosage/Benefits? 
Can be a bit hard to swallow 
Can't get past the taste and size of the tablet 
No proven value 
not much resveratrol for a resveratrol product 
Gotta Love Jarrow! 
Seems OK 
never tried before 
Heard the Raves 
Name not necessarily accurate 
Not as much resveratrol 
Didn't Notice Any Difference

I was sent polyurethane powdered gloves 
Fine 
Don't see any better results than other variations on the theme

Feels harsh but whitens quickly 
I like the product I DO NOT LIKE the price. Way Way too much. 
The real deal 
Works well--but painful sensitivity! 
Not stronger than regular strips 
OK but ................

Too many blades too little comfort -- a demonstration that less is sometimes more 
Nice but overpriced 
The same as my regular (and less expensive) Venus! 
Eh not bad but not great!

Actually my wife's review if you must know.

Too stiff for my tender plantar fasciitis feet :( 
Not so effective but convenient 
Make sure your hands are dry.

Nice 
Good nasal spray 
Very Average

Some change in weight 
Okay I think... 
400 mg of green coffee extract per serving to keep you energized 
Unsure as to how it works 
tastes okay but what is the hype? 
What does it do? 
Doesn't seem to work for me 
Quality product but had no impact on my hunger 
Good concept; results uncertain 
We will see 
Gave Me The Jitters.... 
Less Than Phenomenal 
It seems green coffee beans means less dreams

Amazing results - for the first two weeks ... 
Gives a slight boost 
Too Early to Tell... (but Intriguing Enough to Keep Trying...)

Mixed Review 
Seems to work 
Far as I Can Tell This Will Be a Good Product 
Nothing happened 
Helpful but unsteady 
it's the taste 
Good formula a little too much sugar for my taste 
Great company...

Really About Average So Far 
Repeat Review 
Not quite up to par 
Compare cost to benefit 
OK pain relief 
Works for minor aches and pains but not major ones 
Moderate Pain Relief 
Not for my tendonitis 
Good but not great only short term pain relief 
Not a miracle but helps soften the pain 
Temporary relief

Hard as heck to swallow 
A little better than Snake oil

Okay but not great 
Taste great but worth the price?!? 
Slightly better than average chocolate 
Smooth creamy rich 
Good but not great 
If you already like Werther's you might like these 
Pretty good but a little TOO sweet with a corn-syrupy chocolate taste...

Not the greatest... 
Is there such a thing as BAD chocolate? 
Everyday chocolates 
Caramel doesn't stick to bad teeth 
Tasty but not quite creamy or rich...and high in fat 
Not too bad 
Definitely not the Werther's I grew up with... 
Great tasting candy but lacking much of the original Werther's flavor

Tastes good but not sure it's worth it 
Boost Kid Essentials 
Very nutritious my kids not thrilled with the taste 
NOT ON BOARD.................... 
Somewhat tasty chocolatey packed with nutrients; also unfortunately packed with sugars 
Tastes good but not as \nutritious\ as it would sound... 
Soooo yummy but too high calorie to become a habit.. 
A bit weird 
New box same Boost

Tastes like Nesquik not sure it is worth it 
Out of all the flavors I liked this one the least. 
It's tuna... 
Disappointed 
Bumble Bee Light Tuna in Water 
Tuna in Water

Nothing special 
YOU NEED A MICROSCOPE TO SEE THE PORTION SIZE 
Perfect For Lunch Boxes 
Value Box? 
Loved The Concept 
Really Strange 
True apple taste 
Great Package Mediocre Taste/Texture ... 
Good but an apple is better 
Pretty good apples 
Taste great not filling 
So-so - Seems to have been overly sweetened 
Meh... 
Core included? 
Texture might be an issue for some 
Convenient but not a great value 
I Was Looking For a PG Tips Replacement 
The tea is ok... 
Fantastic price; there is some impurity 
not sure yet 
Sweet smell 
not organic but smells and tastes good 
Just like what it said 
unpleasantly surprised 
Weak flavor boasts a great impression though. 
Okay nothing outstanding 
Country of origin? 
Yep its hot!!  What is the country of origin??? 
I bought it. Now what am I supposed to ... 
Jerky 2 
This is not ground. It's powder

I hope you like mint a LOT 
I was disappointed with this 
Not bad but a little weak in taste and smell. 
Delicious smoky flavor--but claim of \organic\ is untrue 
NO directions 
Not for cooking just for drinks 
Lifetime supply 
These are good quality at a good price... 
Only cream colored maca 
Decent Vanilla Taste #1 Ingredient is water #2 Ingredient is SUGAR 
My daughter liked the first few sips then lost interest 
He likes it doesn't love it 
Will the picky eater like it? 
The cat was really excited 
Not Bad but Could be Better 
A mix of positive and negative 
Essentially a Drink 
Parents love it Picky Kids not so much! 
Not nutritious enough 
Pretty small and sweet

kid essentials vanilla flavored 
Kids don't like the taste 
OK Product

Doesnt Dissolve Well - Evaporated Milk Taste 
Expensive as compared with pure stevia 
Good stuff 
HARD TO COME UP WITH TITLE 
Not very sweet and expensive. 
Super Sugar 
Good addition to a salad 
Probably not worth the price 
Better than white; not as good as wheat 
Serviceable pasta; need to comparison shop for price 
Okay not as healthy as you'd think 
Not Exactly White Taste 
Tasty but there are healthier choices 
;0) 
mixed feelings 
Stays chewy not grainy 
I prefer the thinner noodles version of this pasta since they come out more tender 
Strong whole wheat taste 
Only 51% Whole Wheat..... 
Not up to snuff 
Wasn't bad but it wasn't good either... 
Hard to find locally but overpriced online. 
Not what we expected 
Tastes like oily fish 
Sold down the river 
Hotter than I Expected (due to added \chili flavor\) 
Heat but not much taste 
Interesting But Not For Fish Tacos! 
Too spicy for easy work 
Decent but nothing out of the ordinary overall 
Okay 
Nothing Special...Just Okay 
I love King Oscar but I like to control the heat 
funky taste - maybe from the olive oil ? 
Hot & spicy 
Like a time-bomb for the tastebuds 
Hmmm 
Delicious 
Nice treat 
Good tasting good value high sodium and fat tasty noodles 
A  good Bloody Mary mix but you can EASILY make a Better One

Dented and leaking. 
Useful

Nice flavor of ginger but it's a light tea. 
Not much flavor prefer yerba mate for similar results 
won't use again 
Well blended flavors 
Milder tasting than regular Pu'erh and with little cardamom flavor

Nice taste but the smell! 
3.5 Stars for me 
You might like this for chai - not my cup of tea 
Don't Steep Too Long The First Time You Try It 
The ginger is rather weak... 
weak cardamom flavor 
Try the cardamom flavor instead; this one's a bit blah 
Nothing Special Not Very Gingery 
Not as good as the cardamon 
Just Okay 
Smell of cardamom almost masks the funky odor of the tea 
Where's the Cardamom? 
Perhaps a good tea but better options for Ginger lovers 
A Connoisseur's Tea 
Great black tea with a hint of ginger. 
Pu-Erh is a unique and complex flavor - I like it but ginger just doesn't work here 
Tasted more of dried ginger than pu'er 
NUMI pushing the Pu'erhs these days 
Tastes OK but not good enough for me 
Not very ginger-y 
Not Quite My Cup of Tea (Pun Intended)! 
Strong And Earthy: The Ginger Is Somewhat Subdued In The More Pronounced Pu'ehr Flavor 
3.5 Stars Better Iced 
Not Enough Pu'erh 
Strange tea conditional praise 
Where's The Cardamom? 
Very mild muted flavors with little ginger taste 
Not bad but not something I'll buy again 
Cardamom Pu'erh Tea Bags 
NOT WHAT I EXPECTED 
Good Tea 
I wanted to like this. 
If you need a kick this will get ya 
Needs more ginger! 
Nice ginger overtones 
Very Strong but Good 
Not for me - Strong and earthy 
Cardamon seems weak 
Not my favorite 
An interesting change from \regular\ tea 
I like that it's organic but flavor too mild for me 
Strong tea... Consider adding cream! 
Just okay 
I wish the ginger flavor was stronger 
Meh.... 
Great Company Ethics Mediocre Tea 
Smells delicious. Tastes like water. 
Acquired taste.. 
It's A Lot Better Than The Cardamom Pu'erh Tea 
Unique Flavor &#9679; Pricey &#9679; NOTE: \HIGHER CAFFEINE\ 
A little too much 
bland 
Woody flavor with barely a hint of cardamom 
I don't think I liked it 
Numi seems just ok to me a bit overpriced and odd fish smell 
mildly pleasant cuppa 
Health benefits vs. taste 
Mild hint of ginger 
better price at costco... 
Dilute and runny 
Great price not so great product. 
Hesitated because it was Grade B

Good idea but too much rice syrup for a nutrition bar and too dry as a dessert

It's an expensive granola bar.

COP A CUP OF COMMUNITY? 
Grind it yourself! 
Smooth but not too rich. 
More like Dunkin roast than Starbucks 
Good 
decaf 
Not the Same Cheese Topping as the Blue Box Mac and Cheese 
Acceptable but somewhat overpriced 
Acceptable aroma but lacks in appearance. 
Drinkable but not outstanding 
good coffee but don't expect chocolatey flavor

Not that impressed 
Love this stuff 
Don't get me wrong

They seem to go stale FAST! 
Good Nutritional Value but Taste Like Stale Cookies. 
not as great as I'd imagined 
flavor was not for me but some people may like these quite a bit 
I really like these; nutty snacks 
Good except for added ingredients 
tastes pretty disgusting but works 
Weaker than Regular Sleepytime 
Seems to work but it's hard to rinse 
3 stars for convenience little else 
important to know the size 
Picture looks better than the actual item. 
It looks a lot nicer in the picture than in actuality! 
Check the ingredients and compare... 
Too sweet for me..Not as crunchy as I'd like.

A little better than the Caffe flavor....maybe it's the cocoa. 
Great energy; sweet flavor to start metallic to finish

Not A Product I Would Go Out OF My Way To Buy 
OK but too expensive for my budget 
Plain ordinary coffee 
Decent coffee taste but too much sugar. 
Weak espresso

Got a good kick...super bitter 
very \coffee\ 
OK coffee drink 
Good but price is way too high 
Too sweet 
Tastes...Ok 
it's coffee. in a can. it's illy issimo. 
It's ok for a quick hit of iced espresso

Not a fan of the Orangemint. Chocomint and Cherrymint are much better! 
Okay.  I like the strong mint. 
Not really minty but very spicy 
Not really my cup of tea... 
Another Take on Mint 
Robust European Style Tea 
It's average... 
mint tea 
The taste is very mild - and it was only so so on the energizing 
Delicious but expensive 
Okay taste just not for me. 
Not enough energy... 
A matter of taste 
Nothing special 
Too Mild 
Won't Kill My Coffee Habit But It's Alright 
Good taste Energy? Not so sure 
Great flavor helps me focus but still leaves me with jitters 
The perfect energy might be coming from the caffeine boost instead of the herbs!  It also doesn't have much flavor. 
Great Product Great Price! 
Army brat food.. 
Shipping takes it's toll 
A gift for someone who lives far away and you don't think about that much?

Good when coated in 70% chocolate 
Don't walk down Nature's Path... 
Different textures makes this buyer weary. 
A bunch of different cereals in one box 
This Will Not Be Making It Into My Breakfast Rotation 
Could be worse should be better 
Almost great but a little too sweet and a little too much vanilla

Quick And Easy Curry 
Redolent of kaffir lime and coconut.  Pretty good but not spectacular

Better if it were just the curry paste and not a kit 
Not for everyone 
Good to add to soup 
For Skilled Chefs Only. 
A product in need of a better label 
OK 
instructions were wrong 
As Expected 
Peacock Brown Rice

No unpleasant buzz but not as much boost as I like. 
Not as effective as 5-hr Energy

Comparatively not bad... 
The Red Rain Energy Shot tasted good but the drink did not give me a shot of energy.

Maybe better as a mix 
Reminds me of corn bran... 
Crunchy but not nutty... 
Very sugary and probably not the most healthful cereal

Good flavor but needs improvement - chocolate melted 
Bland granola 
Okay Granola 
Ultra Crunchy and Sweet Granola 
Not The Best 
Just fine tasty but unremarkable and a little stingy with the almonds 
Average except for the Agave 
Just OK. 
Healthier than many other granolas but kind of blah 
tastes good but not for vegans 
OK granola but lacking in vanilla and almonds 
Good Flavor 
Pack of 6 is too much 
No crunch 
disappointing because it doesn't taste like tea 
Create a tea 
Awesome tasting convenient tastes great but... 
Great product poor flavor 
Peachy but not peachy keen. 
Not the best of the flavors 
Unpleasant After Taste 
Artificial Taste no Nutritional Value and Questionable Ingredients..Are You Ready to Try? 
So portable! 
interesting... 
Not Their Best Flavor 
Good but I'll stick to my CL flavors 
a little too tart..... 
Another pretty good drink mix from MIO 
It's not too bad 
Tastes good and is easy to take with you cost is slightly high 
Just okay 
Not your mother's peach tea 
Peach Tea MiO 
Needs a little more tea and a little less peach 
Convenient green not bad tasting but nutritionally questionable 
Decent But Not Really Special... 
Not bad not great 
Makes ordinary water easier to swallow 
Peach yes. Tea? 
It's Okay 
Pretty Good... 
BETTER THAN PLAIN   NOT AS GOOD AS MANGO PEACH 
weird taste 
Blah 
Tastes ok but.. 
Good but Too Sweet for My Taste 
Great concept but peach flavor is underwhelming 
MIo Peach Tea 
It's ok... 
Could be peachier. 
convenient slight hospital taste alcohol based sugars 
Good Idea 
Not the best 
Better than Mango/Peach and Sweet Tea in my opinion 
Not bad but not good either 
Make your own flavored water 
Tasty 
Nice idea for a product but I don't like this flavor 
Concentrated flavor 
Watch out! 
Not bad taste but really fake coloring 
Delicious at first but leaves a stale after-taste 
Great concept but odd artificial peach taste... 
Taste is very subjective but for me this makes water taste worse than it does out of the tap. 
A Little Goes a Long Way 
Peach in an artificial sort of way also super sweet 
Yummy but some concern over ingredients 
Okay in Small Amounts 
Great Concept Handy and Portable but Very Sweet 
Great idea ok taste 
Decent product good tasting but doesn't seem that cost effective 
A Bit TOO Sweet 
Sweet and sweet... no mango with a hint of peach for me 
OK 
I hated it. My roommate loved it. 
Tastes OK but leaves a strange feeling in back of throat 
Great tasting diet tea... sometimes 
The most I taste it the less I like it 
It Is OK 
taste is OK and it is sweet 
Not our favorite 
Not terrible but I wouldn't buy again 
Not really to my taste 
Tastes great but too artificial for my tastes. 
2% natural = 98% chemical 
An alternative to Crystal Light 
It's Okay 
Cheaper to Buy Flavored Water 
It's okay 
Expensive - but tasty 
HANDY PACKAGING  TASTE OKAY 
Good stuff but not worth the price 
too expensive 
Rather insipid flavor but easy to use 
tasty but not worth it 
Tastes okay . . . for a glassful of chemicals 
Better than the tea! 
No thank you.... 
Not Bad Flavor for Water 
Serving Size = 1/2 tsp. 
Tastes Good. Not Sure If Worth the Money. 
Expensive and Mediocre 
Product arrived spilled. 
Tasty but with an artificial aftertaste. 
It's Ok 
Adult Kool Aid 
I hate it when my water looks like wine 
Beats MiO Sweet Tea 
Pretty good 
portable but difficult to measure 
Concoct your own flavored water 
It's OK but I think I like my water un-enhanced. 
Good taste but a messy travel companion 
Way too sweet if you slavishly follow instructions 
Yeah adds some nice flavor but chemical after-taste... 
Can't taste the mango. 
Tastes good but leaves an after-taste 
Like the taste ... not the packaging 
MIO...How sweet it is.... 
Tea for 24 
Peach flavor tastes artificial.... 
Not bad... 
Not So Peachy 
Well-designed container OK nondescript flavor not too keen about the ingredients 
Careful when opening!  Mixed reviews from family on taste certainly can be useful. 
It's better when I mix it with something else 
It's OK if you like artificial sweeteners 
Expensive Maybe Not Worth the Price 
MIO Strawberry Watermelon 
A big disappointment 
Average at best 
Good to take while on the road traveling 
Better than plain water 
I don't get it..... 
Flavor fine user-friendliness fine 
Nothing special 
couldn't review this 
OK Flavor.  Mimics Sweet Tea But Not Quite the Same. 
Better than what I expected it to be 
My daughter loves it......and I don't. 
The packaging is ingenious the concept is great... but this flavor was not a hit in this house 
I have a hard time getting the right flavor for this. 
Useful but... 
Great For Athletic People/Gym Rats 
The Third MIO Flavor I've Tried... 
Just okay 
Easy tea ready to dress up as you see fit 
Not quite tea 
FLAVOR DOES NOT EQUAL THE CLEVER IDEA 
Fake tea flavor 
A Nice Surprise! 
Not bad but I wouldn't carry it in my pocket 
Oh Mio Myo You. Whatever Shall We Do? 
Great Idea but Too Much Aftertaste 
Tastes OK and handy but prefer real H2O or tea 
Tastes good & convenient - but hard to judge amount 
It Tastes Better Than Water But..... 
A Nice Treat 
1/2 tsp = a serving; use within a month of opening; no refrigeration required 
Almost did not try this 
It's ok but not a great substitute for the real thing 
Cool design great idea not great flavor. 
Better than plain water but not great 
A good idea 
OK kind of a funny taste 
Concoct your own flavored water 
Not quite Sweet Tea but good! 
Not a fan of the Sweet Tea flavor.. 
Tastes too artificial for me 
I've Had Better Water Enhancers 
Great packaging/idea but mediocre flavor 
Sweet Tea by the drop 
So-So 
A little bit too sweet for my taste but tastes exactly like it says 
Not bad...even though it doesn't taste like sweet tea 
It's OK 
An Alternative to Carbonated Beverages 
Absolutely artificial. But it tastes good. 
Fairly yummy some concern over ingredients 
Not great but not terrible (and easy to use) 
Taste good but........... 
tad stale but tasty 
Weird Aftertaste 
sweet 
Ok not great 
I love the French Vanilla 
Not sure yet 
Spicey Eggnog coffee 
Not much Eggnog flavor 
Nice strong spicy egg nog flavor 
I was expecting x-mas 
Funky aftertaste 
Cute basket with lots of nice chocolates but the truffles didn't look right. 
Quality and Convenience vs. Quantity and Time 
Nice chocolate way too expensive 
5 for flavor; 1 for price. If price is not a factor... 
Fair 
Tea is OK 
Very mild not my cup of tea 
premium fresh stacks 
Tasty review? Not really. Necessary product? Not really either. 
Right-Size Packaging Needs Right-Size Pricing 
Taste fine but trans fat and small package premium 
New concept on an already great product 
Just different packaging 
Did Nabisco change their recipe? 
Interesting 
Not a cookie - more like a digestive biscuit 
newtons tries something different 
Not really a huge fan of these 
Light but sticky 
A Crunchy Cookie with Mixed Results 
Tasty cookie from trusted Nabisco but too fragile for shipping 
Not bad but not great either. 
Very tasty snack 
Tasty but Those Troublesome Dried Fruit 
I like these but the kids are not sure... 
C+ Concensus on Crispy Cranberry Cookie 
Crispy crunchy hearty. 
One out of two in my family like these 
Not a terribly healthy choice 
Pretty good with hot coffee 
Decent Healthy Cookie But Needs More Cranberry 
Okay taste. 
An Adult Treat 
Pretty good 
Mostly Harmless 
Not bad but what's the point when fig bars are so yummy? 
Not very figgy 
Okay taste for whole grain snack but 47 calories per cookie 
Not a big hit.... 
Newtons Fruit Thins 
Mediocre 
not bad... 
Not as good as the original 
Taste peaks so does the price 
A Crunchy Cookie with Mixed Results 
Definitely Needs Milk 
So-so cookies 
Why call it a Newton? 
Not bad but overpriced for the quality 
Addicted to original so why change? 
Just OK 
Meh. 
Not very Fig-y 
Bland Entry in a Crowded Market 
Kind of dry.... 
Crunchy biscuit no obvious fig or honey flavor 
Fig & Honey? 
A little chewy for a crispy cookie 
Meh 
A tasty snack with one small caveat. 
A little bland but good with coffee... 
Nothing Special 
Reasonable Cookie - Palm Oil is a Concern 
Da Better Flavor but still I've eaten better 
Smelled better than they tasted 
They were just ok for me. 
Decent cookie but horrible aftertaste 
Tastes like a digestive biscuit with vestiges of fig 
mediocre cookies 
Like a graham cracker with fruit 
Tasty but Not as Good as Original Newtons 
Do not think \cookie\ 
Call it a Cinnamon 'Thin' with fig bits for a more accurate name. 
Good but not the best for dieters 
Nothing Special 
Not an exciting product. 
Just okay 
A British Tea Biscuit? Really? 
A bit too sweet 
Misleading name but good anyway 
Not your typical Newtons 
Meh 
It's more like a cracker 
Good reasonably healthy for a cookie 
I wasn't that impressed 
Taste is Great - Good Cookie Alternative 
natural flavor? 
Good for peanut butter & jelly sandwiches 
Not a huge fan 
Tastes great but NOT a healthy snack 
Almost great 
They have a lot of fiber... 
You Can Really Smell The Blueberry 
A bit too dry and crunchy 
Blueberries and Brown Sugar 
Good pricey and has been done before 
More Milk Please! 
Probably 3 1/2 stars 
if you want healthier these are good 
Good taste but be aware  of the packaging unless you want \cookie pieces\ 
Good snack food 
Good compromise for kids snacking 
Tastes like a graham cracker with bits of blueberry... 
flavor vs aftertaste 
Honey Maid Fresh Stacks 
Stack-a-licious! 
Familiar taste new packaging worth the price? 
Not Impressed 
Gimmicky packaging 
Ah...Graham Crackers 
too much packaging for me 
Nice Packaging 
Convenient but lacking taste 
A half honey graham cracker is still a honey graham cracker 
Fresh Stack Honey Grahams 
Still got stale easily but a nice thought 
Same Cracker Different Package 
Same treat... a little better package 
Good For On The Go 
Fresh and yummy but was delivered as mostly crumbs 
Great Idea for Freshness But Execution Suffers 
Honey maid... 
less product more money 
Great for travel and snack not anything special for regular eating. 
Same great grahams not much improvement on packaging 
Not for the Health Conscious 
not quite what I was looking for 
Not the best. 
Organic at twice the cost of regular raisins 
An OK shortbread 
Coconut Dream 
A good nut milk 
watery but tasty 
Guayusa is for stoics. 
Great product but it was spoiled by lousy shipping 
Cadburys Chocolate Spread 
Tasty but doesn't taste anything like a Cadbury bar 
Poor choice of plastic bag for shipping!

Good value 
Eh! 
Canola cottonseed and/or soybean oil 
Barilla Ditalini is OK 
NEVER EAT THIS BREAD RAW! 
Good with... 
Tastes ok good value 
LOVE EM' BUT PEEL IT PLEASE 
Don't bother unless you actually like instant coffee 
Micro Grind 
REFRESHING BUT..... 
Decent enough rice 
Convenient but not very tasty 
No refrigeration needed 
It's Okay 
TOO MUCH 
An OK Rice Pasta but Don't Overcook 
just ok 
Organic Pure Honey... 
Curious Flavor and Aftertaste 
Tasty but canned in \vegetable oil\ 
Not exactly what I expected 
Synthetic taste and chemical aftertaste 
not the best 
Chai Latte 
It's OK 
Texture?  JUST LIKE CHICKEN!  Wish it was less seasoned though... 
strong 
OK 
Milk not packed well; arrived leaking. 
Unsure if GMO 
Not Wild About 
Good but not Organic 
Chalky Mouthfeel Due to Added Calcium 
Tastes great but surprised by the quantity 
sweet 
Not-as-perfect-as-I-expected Perfect Iced Tea Variety 
great smell good enough taste 
Mostly Maple 
really does smell like French Toast 
Very little taste 
Good for kids with allergies 
OK but nothing special 
Best Pumpkin Cookie I've Ever Had (and Worst) 
good but.. 
Decent but Really Strong We Prefer Others...

Iced Coffe K-Cup 
Very dry 
Okay 
Normal goldfish 
Ok! 
Brownie mix 
Info wrong 
Disappointed long-time fan of the Krusteaz brand 
Somewhat disappointed 
Looks great - Tasted odd 
Sugar Overload! 
Tasty not entirely unhealthy VERY sweet 
not much healthier than \regular\ caramel popcorn 
totally delicious BUT.... 
Tasty But Not Necessarily Worth the Calories/Price 
Caramel Corn = YUM! (fudge drizzle = meh.) 
I would pass 
Cracker Jacks without the Nuts! 
what ain't good for ya is good to ya 
Okay 
Delicious but diminutive 
It's all sugar baby! 
Salty & Sweet But Not Healthier 
Pretty Good but still using corn syrup 
Smartly packaged...but painfully sweet 
Sweet treat 
Decent but would be better without the cheap \fudge\ 
An OK treat 
Sweet and Crunchy 
More fudge-y than carame-ly! 
Over priced for the product 
Depends on What You're Looking For... 
Very very sweet not diet food 
A Bit On The Sweet Side 
Eh What more can I say? 
Chocolate & Popcorn 
Portion control and taste! 
Popcorn Caramel & Chocolate Fix all in one 
Good calorie count but perhaps too sweet 
Good size but just too sweet 
*Extremely* sweet! 
A quick sweet tooth fix 
just your average caramel popcorn 
Be Careful... They are Deliciously Sweet and Yummy 
You can't snack \well\ with corn syrup 
Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is too sweet for my taste 
Good Caramel Weak Chocolate 
A nice low calorie snack option 
a light snack but very sweet and high in sugar 
3-1/2 stars: mixed reviews from a single family 
All Sugared Up With Noplace To Go 
Not that great.  Shouldn't be labeled oreos as they really aren't. 
Ok - sweet but lacking in a distinctive flavor March 24 2011 
Lots of calories and sweetness (not a proper Oreo) 
Not what I expected. 
So... rich... 
Tasty but probably not something to order via Amazon 
If I'm going to pay this much for a cookie I'm going to buy it from a little girl in uniform 
average - not as good as expected 
Not Quite as Good As I Dreamed 
Yes But Is It Still An Oreo? 
Girl Scouts \Tagalong\ by a different name. 
Like a Reese 
Not much Oreo flavor slight artificial aftertaste 
Tagalongs! 
Not enough oreo! 
Thin sweet cookies 
An interesting take on Oreo Cookies 
Greasy but addictive. 
Consider your shipping location carefully! 
Pretty Good Cookie but Not Great 
Not what I expected. 
Different but not as good as just-plain Oreoes 
OK but not the best buy 
Tastes good to me but probably not great for health 
Not the best Oreo 
more of candy treat vs a cookie- MESSY ! 
Not overwhelmed. 
Where's the Peanut Butter? 
Good not great. 
Friend liked'em I did not 
In Search of The Peanut Butter Oreo... 
More Candy Than Cookie and Oh So Sweet! 
Better than the Mint ones still lacking 
Not that great.  Shouldn't be labeled as Oreos. 
Falls short of Oreo perfection. 
Half an Oreo covered in melty fudge 
Cookie Crunch Lost in Peanut Butter and Fudge Creme 
Peanut Butter Oreos...blech 
Good not great 
Peanut Butter Creme.... 
No really an Oreo. 
Nice idea but bitter aftertaste 
Where is the peanut butter or the fudginess? 
Not As Yummy As I Had Hoped 
Pretty generic cookie all told 
High Goo to Cookie Ratio 
Tasty cookies one star off for outrageous price 
This is for the peanut butter creme not golden variety... 
Continuing with the Girl Scout Cookie Theme Mint are Better 
I'll Stick with the Original Oreos 
SUPER CUTE VERRRYY Sweet smell amazing..a weird review... 
Oreo in name only. 
I would not buy them myself 
Very chocolately but offputting texture. 
Somewhat tastier that what I expected for a somewhat healthier snack 
Not my thing but the kids ate them all 
Snackwell Brownie Bites: Dry but Acceptable 
Good in a pinch. 
Edible Just Not Incredible... 
Perfect size treat but lacking in flavor 
Disappointing...but low calorie chocolate 
Mixed Reviews 
Good and bad points 
Okay snack but not as good as the real thing... 
State of the Artificial 
Split decision 
Just like mother used to bake...almost 
didn't love these 
Perfectly Portioned Imperfection 
Disappointed at the composition of these \Brownie Bites\ 
Lacking Something 
Lunchbox friendly chocolate snack 
Eh... 
Weird Texture (in a good way) but Not Enough for a Real Snack 
Not so much... 
Not worth the calories carbs and fat 
Not as good as expected 
Dry and Disappointing 
Okay 
Other Products Pack More in 150 Calories 
Just alright. 
Pretty good but... 
Mixed opinions on fudge creme brownie bite 
They're OK. They taste like tiny brownies. 
Needs more chocolate 
Ersatz product with the hint of brownie 
Not my favorite... 
It was OK not amazing 
Doesn't win an \eat this...not that\ contest 
Neat But Not Moist 
A ho-hum confection 
Not bad but Snackwell has other tastier options 
It's okay 
okay 
Probably not the healthiest. 
Great taste Not healthy enough 
Weird sweet 
blah 
Not My Cup of Tea 
Don't like them but kids like these 
A bit too punchy 
crispy snack 
better than candy 
Lior Tahini All Natural 100% Pure Sesame 17.6 Oz (Pack of 4) 
Much better than their spicy ranchero sauce 
Its alright 
Good flavor but doesn't stand out 
Decent flavor for a quick fix 
It Tastes Like Spicy Catalina Dressing 
Not for me 
I'm From New Jersey what do I know about Chipotle? 
Not as good as the other Taco Bell sauces 
Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce 
Better than the Ranchero sauce 
Not spectacular but pretty good 
Just like the restaurant 
Not bad but not something I'd rush out and buy.... 
Tastes Like Spicy Salad Dressing 
Yummy - Expires too Soon 
A nice dip 
very strong with a powdery taste 
Not bad not great just okay 
That's Some Spicy Sauce! 
Great tasting but way too fatty! 
Yum! (maybe) 
All right but not extraordinary 
Not craving it 
Fast Food salad dressing 
Heavy on Smoke and Vinegar 
Okay 
About what you'd expect.  S'okay. 
If you are hungering for some Taco Bell - this is the sauce for you! 
Well they got half of it right ... 
Tricky to meld with my summertime harvest 
Ehhh 
Kind of an interesting taste but nothing I crave 
Just spicy enough - not overwhelming 
Bold and Creamy Chipotle 
Very mild! 
Neither Bold Nor Spicy 
Pretty good but not sure what to do with it yet 
False advertising but tasty 
God loves you

I Would've given it a 3.5 but I can't

An adequate if not essential release 
lacks something but overall okay.

Not Quite There 
Pet Shop Bo...I mean Postal Service!  Yay. 
When did Kajagoogoo get back together??? 
Bleeping and Blipping into Oblivion... 
Dancefloor detachment 
Postal Service delivers relief from your cynicism 
Four songs don't make up an album: stick to Death Cab for Cutie 
Chiming elecro-pop that manages to fill a void 
Crossbred electropop 
Ehhh. 
Not so great 
Not awful but Dido is capable of better 
Good sophomore album but not as good as the firts one 
Dido's symphony... 
Dido can use a more aggressive approach to her music.

Mew's best effort 
Jewelicious  (3 1/2 stars) 
Flawed Jewel 
Different Does Not Mean Bad 
Not Too Shabby 
Not her best but not as bad as you'd think initially

Way downhill... 
Shaking her Shakira?  Glad she got it out of her system. 
Most artists step outside the square once

good pop cd 
Maybe It Seemed Better On Paper... 
What Happened? 
A Sleepy Albumyet Rock oriented 
Good but doesn't do much for me... 
Good pop-rock sound but married to uneven songwriting. 
Some steps forward but still way too glossy 
Slowly succumbing to the curse of formula 
Good but not as good as &quot;The Spirit Room&quot; 
This had the ability to be so much better.... 
Could Have Been So Much Better!  Not All Remixes! 
Again nice to hear different versions of her songs

Should Be Better Than This 
Beautiful At Times Powerful But Most of the Time Just Slow and Average 
A missed opportunity 
We've been waiting 6 years for this?

Surfacing to this? 
some New Wave 
It gets worse everytime I listen to it

Mediocre effort 
Not great not awful just average 
A solid rocking release from &quot;The Cure&quot;. 
Average eclectic mix of Cure styles 
Good Songs...BAD Production 
The original pop act is back...but could've been stronger 
Another decent but not spectacular record by the Cure. 
it's okay 
Music as medication 
Tired and uninspired 
Musically fresh lyrically and vocally familiar 
Why do I keep buying this g-unit garbage. 
I didn't get quite enough 
Good enough

SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!! 
Average. It could have been better. 
Pretty Good Set 
THE BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE................. 
Who is Jill Scott Again? 
Whew..

An amazing potential that has yet to be entirely fulfilled. 
Pleasant but nothing earth-shattering 
Harmony on Harmonium 
and a half... 
Off to a good start 
One song for the time capsule and a bunch of promise 
Average (at best) 
Promises of Promise 
Good Effort; Lots of Potential; Nalick shouldn't be afraid to move out of her Comfort Zone 
Good songs lots of potential terrible production 
Where is album no. 2? 
Something to look forward to

Something about this release.. 
Annoying as F***

This is R&B: Rap and Bulls**t. 
You know what 
wondering who tripped the breaker 
Nice Spin on Classic Songs 
Doesn't it seem like he's coasting just a bit? 
Juvi's Reality Check bounced 
Over saturation 
Could have contained more hits 
Speaking up

(3.5 stars). Some awesome material mixed with some avarege one 
I HEARD ITAND I WAS NOT MOVED...LOOKS LIKE AN OK ALBUM 
really good 
Some sublime some merely ordinary 
Anyway. 
Pretty enough but many songs are forgettable 
Intriguing at first.  Surprisingly though the allure fades soon. 
Maybe I'm amazed... actually not. 
Sitting On The Fence Out In The Backyard 
Okay... 
Oh those expectations! 
Lets add a star and a half 
One of McCartney's Best but Not the Best 
Wildflower is a weed

Some hits some misses..... 
Love is A Hurtin' Thang 
where's Sheryl

As  Expected 
The Day After The Album!! 
Almost every track is about a girl... dang Twista 
A Solid Album 
Not bad 
What happened to the old twista 
Middling 
An OK album nothing to get excited over. 
It's not really what I expected?! 
Her head's in the clouds all right 
Twelve Years? Really? 
Milking the double discs 
Lulling narcotizing introspective mood pieces... 
Kate has mellowed 
Im a hardcore KB fan but this album is somewhat dull. 
Serenecontentedbut not very dynamic 
mothering heights 
3.14159265 
Birdie birdie birdie. Could have been a stunning single disc 
Far from a slam dunk 
I wasn't as impressed by this Liz Phair album... 
That's not Phair

Unplugged by Alicia Keys

Here We Go Again.... 
NOT BAD...MAYBE 2 1/2 STARS 
Alicia Overhyped Keys 
It's not too shabby... 
Very Solid eclectic rock 
I Love the Band Hate the Destructive Software in the CD 
Please enter a title for your review 
Re-recording your most popular tracks years later doesn't always translate well 
A double disc... 
A good CD but misses its goal. 
I Don't Have This Record But I Have Created My Own Best Of Album 
Hits & Misses 
As one writer put it \An Iffy Collection.\ 
Not So Great As Their Previous Albums

Juelz Santana ----- What the Game's Been Missing! 
Sophomore Jinxbut still good 
pretty good 
Quite Nice. 
3 1/2. Step ur lyrics up Juelz... 
This Sophmore effort is NOT that good 
Would they lie to you? 
I Was Thinking Of Something Sleek To Wrap Around My Tender Throat. 
Where Is Don't Ask Me Why? 
A quick but enjoyable look at their U.S. & U.K. hits respectively... 
+1/2 -- Modern country-pop from American Idol

One of the strongest American Idol albums 
Good but lacking 
Oh There's Nothing Like Oklahoma 
Duets: The Final Chapter by The Notorious B.I.G. 
Forever King of New York 
(3.5 Stars) R.I.P. Biggie Smallz 
Biggie's Ready To Die but Puff won't let him 
let the man rest in peace 
my honest opinion 
Decent final chapter 
Biggie's Last Album Ends Up Very Limited 
Meh 
Nice Soothing Romantic Set 
A BIT SKIMPY & LACK OF VARIETY COMPARED TO 1ST CD 
Needs some work listen to the mixtape 
Fort Minor - The Rising Tied 
Nice concept and ideas 
An Album that Almost Gets it Right 
3-1/2 Stars -- Holding his own on his own 
Too Much Hype!!! 
(3.5 Stars) Good Effort....But Still Needs Some Fine Tuning.

wayne wayne wayne \shakez my head\ 
Average to me 
this album aint all that 
I ALL READY KNEW THIS WAS NOT GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS CATER VOL1...NO DISS TO WAYNEBUT HIS FLOW IS STARTING TO SOUND LIKE JAY-Z 
Not great but not that awful 
Don't belive the hype 
A crossroad at the height of their career 
Until The Breakthrough... 
Not as good as the rest 
MJB:doing Her Best Mariah 
The Breakthrough 
Mediocre 
Honestly...... 
More Mary: Not Broken (or Fixed) 
Impressive gets better with each listen! 
PLEASE put the pen down Shakira 
Catchy in its own way 
Need To Wash & Dried In The Laundromatic!! 
I didn't develop a 'Fixation' for this album...... 
Nothing to be fixated about 
Volume 1 gets the prize. 
HOW DOES SHE DOES? 
It just kills me to write this... 
A Step Back 
Uncle Woody meets R.Kelly 
They're great...Which means they're not (see title of CD please) 
Unfair Expectations 
A Lesser Imitation... 
Keeps rock'n' roll going along fairly well 
A good first effort (but interesting to see if they grow) 
Not All That Great 
A Greatest Hits That Needs Improvement..... 
Barely gives me a buzz. 
A Good Starter Set but not Definitive-- 
good but not what I expected 
Luda & DTP 
(3.5 Stars) Better Than The 1st DTP Album But Still Room To Improve! 
Decent CD from an okay group. 
Not Luda 
pretty good Isley's album 
Solid collection with some very notable omissions 
pretty good Hits package 
Rock and roll is built on shopping. 
Madonna is still the master 
One more item of your OCD 
Not quite all of Oates and Hall. 
DRS said \This Is For...MY HOMIES!\  That's About All This CD Is For! 
Scarface should have left some of his \Homies\ at home this time around 
A Good Album from Scarface 
Strong Cd i wish there was more scarface on it 3.5 
Definitely not an album with general appeal 
new good and old still good 
yeah yeah 
YES ! (but only for die hard fans or as starting point) 
3-1/2 stars -- An improvement but he's still got some evolving to do 
It's Not Raw Enough (2.5 Stars) 
Robin Thicke's Got A Love Jones 
3 1/2 stars. Nice. 
A Pleasant Suprise But 'Deluxe Edition' ? NO WAY! 
Music in the Genes! 
3-1/2 stars -- Not quite purr-fect but still good 
The Don sounds a little tired. Some of the songs do too. 
Three stars is like dancing with your sister 
Whatever Happened to the H gang? 
Still Undecided. 
Good value but still missing many rare remixes?! 
Where's The Extended Versions Of \Erotic City\\Head\\Sexy Dancer\ and \Party Up\?? 
A DISSERVICE 
Ultimate Prince...? 
His royal badness 
Everytime I Hear This! 
the mainstreaming and death of vocal trance 
Not What I Expected! 
It's a good album but... 
trim the songs back 50% next time 
Where are the melodies? 
At War with the Mystics 
they might be human after all.... 
Less lingering 
Every Time You State Your Case 
What exactly does he want to do? 
LL 
Still Solid After All These Years.... 
UNCLE L 
You Need To Control Yourself! 
(3.5 Stars) 'Todd Smith' Gives Us An Okay Album....AGAIN!!! 
Is it a comeback for LL? 
A good effort for the veteran original \Prince of Rap\ 
Commercial But Got it's Fair Share of Good Songs 
A LOT of Filler 
Probably the only good cd out there. 
The CD has grown on me 
pretty cool elo album 
Good compilation of hits and history of the band 
Not the best of their stuff 
A Better Album Than Their First 
The potential is still there... 
THIS album should have been called Amerika'z Nightmare 
Its aight...need to get used to some of these songs. 
Mobb Deep - Blood Money 
Party's over tell the rest of the crew 
Slightly dissapointed... 
Mobb Deep took 50 Cent's \Blood Money\ so don't expect \The Infamous\ or \Murda Muzik\ anymore. 
Not Really that Bad Not Really that Good 
Dissapointing and weak for an MD joint not totally horrible. 
Dissapointment 
Actually it's a 3.5 effort... 
RED HOTS Fade to GREY 
Mainstream fare and overrated 
Here's my two cents. 
Not As Good As I Hoped It Would Be 
Pink Warm Cherry Tomatoes 
Twice as many winners twice as much junk 
There's a great single album in here. 
Would Be Much Better As A Single Disc 
Homogeneous Production Stifles Virtues 
As VIBE Magazine said \Not on THESE streets\ 
Not Bad I hoped that it would've been better 
very good 
(Rating 6 Out Of 10): It's A Good Experimental Album Just Not For Me... 
They Say I'm CRAAAAYYYZZAAAAYYY! 
I hate when record companies do this 
Nothing Fits Quite Like Polyester. 
Not Quite An MVP 
Why only three stars? Well... 
Not an equal partnership 
'Pimpalation' Doesn't Live Up To The UGK Name. 
This is gonna be a real killa for himself! 
3.5 Stars not bad but not too good either 
5th Time Arround 
TIMING CAN BE A KILLA...... 
KILLA! 
Yes this is a departure 
Pretty good for a freshman album. 
Between two extremes. 
Good first album from Yung Joc 
20/20 hearing with unnecessary corrective surgery 
rapping and good production 
What? Someone actually cares about a Field Mob album? 
(3.5 Stars) Field Mob Getting Better With Time 
its the new mob

Liking It - 3.5 stars

The Eraser 
Low-Budget Radiohead 
Half As Good Still Worth Your Time

Loved this song from Supertramp 
3-1/2 stars -- Silver lining

Review of Vinyl Version 
Okay! 
Overplayed 
I like 2 songs the album was cheap so I got it. 
I'm sitting on the fence about MUSE... 
It's not a good album or a bad album. It's just a Muse album. 
3 1/2 really good songs not much else 
Music for backgrounds 
Centipedal to the Metal 
Not up to par 
Free 
Not Their Best Work But Still Enjoyed It 
Unfortunately not more of the same 
Not all i thought this would be 
+1/2 - A country legend's farewell studio session 
A handful of solid tracks but a loudness wars disaster and weaker songwriting than on Tame Impala's debut 
Maybe a Sophmore flop 
A few catchy songs but it did not blow me away 
Trying to like this band 
Try and buy the few songs you like 
Breathing Fire 
Not near as enjoyable as their last CD unfortunately... 
Nearly ruined by lyrical laziness... 
Has some good qualities but not for me. 
Not bad

Odd but you might like it if you like odd. 
between two and three stars

My First PDA but now I can pick a better one!

Background fuzz/feedback is noticeable.

Quality depends on vehicle 
Great product

Relatively inexpensive but mine squeaks..... 
Didn't play nice with my tape deck 
Mechanical issues

A little cheaper than you might expect 
It's alright. 
Cheap 
It's too flat 
Great for TV (Bad for cable modem) 
Does the job 
Works but a little concerned with the description 
Wire so flimsy but it worked OK. 
RCA  =  bad quality

Hummmm 
If you value fidelity ...spend the extra 20 bucks and get 100% pure copper. 
Came up short 
Copper clad aluminum wire 
Copper Clad not pure copper. 
good wire 
It works as expected 
It's frayed 
Not bad wire. 
I didn't need the wire. It is good to have it around as the price of precious metals go up. 
Cheap wire  but usable 
Inexpensive Speaker Wire 
I've seen better and worse cable. This is only so so so 
Good quality but wires are not clearly distinguishable 
16 gauge is 16 gauge 
Works just fine for light loads 
Well its wire. 
Good price for the length but thick insulation. 
It's just that....speaker wire 
Fine 
Seems thin but works for my application 
OKAY 
Good product 
Decent but it's not copper 
Good buy 
It's not 16-Gauge Speaker Wire 
It's okay but not great. Next time get the mediabridge!! 
don't like it but don't hate it...... 
Just OK 
Speaker wire 
It is wire 
By whose measure? 
Lower Quality Than Expected 
RCA via China 
ok but not great 
Pretty good 
Works as advertised 
Eh....it's fine for the price but....

Be aware of the size of the lens cap you place it on. 
Alternative solution

Extremely Comfortable but lacks precision 
Only Average 
Same problem as Tinderbox  in spotlight review 
Average mouse 
great device to get! 
Does it really work? 
Flexible Pin type Connectors may not be the best choice 
Overpriced 
Overpriced but convenient 
Just OK 
Just okay 
Works fine 
Good Palm device w/ poor details - TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE 
Great speakers until the sub died! 
Slow. Slow.  Did I say slow? 
Nothing special. 
Happy & Sad To Have This Card 
Good Hardware But Bad Support 
ADD ON ANTENNA 
Remarkable 
GPS case 
Nice but could be bigger 
Not worth the retail price. 
Atlantic Wave 
Mixed 3 - above average design but WARNING:  unsatisfactory fit somewhat difficult to assemble 
Unneccessary 
Whatever 
They just don't last. 
Buy an aftermarket battery 
Works ok 
An ok battery for the price. 
Dim screen can't make up for other great aspects. 
Passable 
Not For Everyone!

For the money it's worth it. 
10\ Speakers 
Awesome product USB 2.0 coming soon though!

It could have been a 5 
Beware if you want to use this as a VPN server! 
Good MP3 player but not great 
SP50 is great...

Just OK for Expedition 
They hit for sure but the con. 
Buyer beware ... 
Old set vs New set 
Great sound but two serious design flaws 
Great Until The Plugs Died 
Been using this system for a few hours now 
Good sounding speakers until they die prematurely 
KLIPSCHIT 
Sound is OK but not the best - save your money for a Bose 
disappointing midrange performance 
I think Logitechs are better 
Great Sound BUT....... 
Good Speakers but cables and connections are very poor 
Whether they are working or not is a gamble. 
Satellite speakers sound great. Bass is weak. 
Expensive but good quality for computer speakers. 
volume adjustment noisy 
Just Okay- Nothing to write home about or leave a wonderful review here. 
Great Sound but Lasted 1 yr 
dependability 
UPDATED REVIEW - February 2012 
I've got some good reasons to disagree with 900+ reviews on this one... 
Owned them for a long time DIN Plug Flaw 
lower quality in current version? 
On the fence. 
TOO MUCH BASE FOR MUSIC 
Nice system with a few bizarre quirks 
Worked well at first unstable after less than 1 year 
Not bad but I can not recommend it. 
I think 256S100 is the right choice 
Old Technology but good for old PCs 
There are better options 
Great big bang for your buck 
Reliable yet slower than Sony Memory stick 
Slow on Nikon 995 
Extremely slow 
Good Value but Could Be Faster 
dont get it. 
Not for use with Multi-Media Cards 
Ok....Sometimes 
Remote Confusion 
OK DVD/CD player for the money you spend on it 
Almost perfect except 
Great for average listening 
Sony medium quality 
Great transaction 
Kodak MAX CRV3 Lithium Battery 
Here's the URL for the latest drivers 
Lots to Like but a few design flaws 
Only three words to say...... 
Consider the Archos \Recorder\ Line Instead 
Great storage capacity 
Good for the price.  iPod is much better overall 
It's fine but... 
Get almost what you pay for 
Better off getting a name brand 
Protection of your system thats all...rest is hype 
Ok 
Works well but a few minor complaints 
I like it but it uses both plugs in an outlet 
Did not fix the buzz in my subwoofer 
Seems to work OK. 
OK but beware of usual Monster hype 
Third Time's a Charm 
No better or worse than any other wire.  Much better advertising. 
Decent cable less than 100 feet 
Overpriced hard to pull 
MONSTER - VERY MISLEADING AGAIN!!!!  - length is only 80 ft. and wire is only 16 gauge !! 
Tried the cable with my subwoofer but could not tell a difference. 
wrong cable sent 
Good for light weight speakers 
Could it be that they make some cheaper than others???? 
Still Kicking it around 
battery's life is too short!!! 
Good but not Great Player 
Buffer doesn't work well over time. Awful for audiobooks 
Very good but not the best 
Good image quality poor design. 
Wish it was a bit wider 
Useful But... 
Flying CDs! 
It's okay I guess 
it was ok... 
To bulky for my taste 
Obstructs view 
A decent entrey-level camera. 
I rate this camera....So So 
Good for novice photographer 
So close and yet so far... 
Zaurus 5500 PDA 
Good but watch out for Wi-Fi Support. 
Great Mouse for Most Users 
All most a great mouse 
First impressions review: Not what I expected 
Everything's great except for a loose [clicky] scroll wheel 
Too small 
Nice bag but you need powerful thumbs to open 
Incomplete Description 
Too big too expensive 
Great features but where's the 45dB?! 
ok did not see any amplification 
cheap alternative for free OTA HDTV signals 
Okay with lots of re-scanning 
Okay but not great! 
Basslink - Second Unit 
I like it but 
returned mine after viewing all reviews 
Great for the period of the warranty... 
Nothing special cheaper than the iPod 
Good Remote Control Features 
Good but there's a better option 
Too bad Sony just wants more of your money 
great price. but low resolution video... 
Works just fine 
Image Stabilization only OK 
Great Image Stabilizer; Mediocre Optics and Mechanics 
SporTrak Map 
What else? Microsoft. 
Takes a big adjustment to get used to it 
Comfortable but unnatural placement of some keys 
Great keyboard lousy mouse 
Buy the White One Instead 
Comfortable Keyboard but the 6 is a Pain 
Loosing the \E\ 
Great Keyboard With Some Faults 
The only game in town not very durale tho 
A good digital camera - if you have some patience

Driveway Patrol Sensor and Receiver Kit 
Not too sensitive and the alarm is not very loud

Cheap.  But there is a CATCH!

Opening The \Doors\ 
HiFi Buff 
This is a review of the mp3 download of THE DOORS 
Clean sound but a little disappointed with the surround treatment 
It's the rim-shot baby. 
They did get much higher... 
Don't Buy the MP3 Version if You Want the Full Remix! 
When the music's over rerelease reshuffle repackage remix and remaster it 
A normalized recording that sounds neither analog nor emotional 
radio edited! 
James \Jim\ Morrison was not \all that\ 
Should have purchased the non 40th anniversity edition 
The best and the worst 
Not bad... 
Another L.A. Woman 
DVD-Audio version is decent attempt 
An uneven but worthy finale 
Only for Hard Core Doors Fans 
Attempting the dignified exit 
Over-Rated 
I don't agree with the current conventional wisdom. 
5 Star Album 1 star for stereo remixing 
Nice album maybe if you were there at the time you might enjoy it more

Nice beach music 
anticlimatic at best 
Not judging the music but the DVD Audio edition 
not even top 10 of 1966 
#2 on RS 500 ..its good but.. 
Disappointing release 
It's good but terribly overrated 
Album is 5 stars DVD-Audio is 1 Star DTS 5 STars 
Wouldn't It Be Nice...? 
Important yes great no. 
NO NO NO. 
why pet sounds REALLY isn't the best album of all time 
Pet Sounds 
I wish I could like this more 
You must be joking..... 
Unusually strong for 1966 but less so out of context 
&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; surround mix basically 4.0 
it wasn't a certified million seller in part because of 
Influential and important? Sure. Great? Not so much. 
In the Eye of the Beholder 
Dated 
Mastering just OK 
Sorry America..... 
Groundbreaking = Yes!  Masterpiece = No!

Good singing forgettable tunes 
The Direction Begins To Wander 
Stately sung soul 
Better than Low still a lot of crap. 
Second of the Berlin Trilogy Now In MLPS Format! 
Experimenting with the sound- Not always successfully but never less than interesting

You're Face to Face 
macho bowie (smile when you say that)

More historical than essential 
Only for fanatical fans. 
A nice snapshot but... 
Interesting Live Performance! 
The first All-Starr Band 
Good Music But An Unnecessary Purchase 
A pretty screwy live disc but passably entertaining 
The real hits are good! 
3.5 stars

Picks you up just to knock you down 
Disappointing and Bizarre

simple renditions 
Melodious to My Ears 
On an island 
Unrealized potential....

Far from `Copper Blue's' magic but still good 
Loud pop songs 
A voice of dissent

John and Yoko's Wedding Gift To The World. 
One of the worst recordings I've  heard. 
Dave has a devil's advocacy streak sometimes 
This Is Not All That Bad 
A Conventional Effort From An Unconventional Artist 
Both pop and jazzy with a very articulate directed Yoko 
Onowhat was I thinking 
I Beg To Differ 
The most difficult Ono CD for me to critique 
A bit dated 
Mothers 
This time Zappa's sense of humour works against him...

Interesting to a point 
The Crazy Re-done versions 
Whats wrong here? 
Mural's wedding. One song drags it down though.  65/100 
A strange collage 
Better things had to come after...this is the starting point 
For Experienced Zappa Fans and Fans of Musique Concrete Only 
Okay 3.5 but no choice for that 
Good 
pretty pretty? 
A question 
5 stars for the original vinyl 3 stars for the CD edits 
Remixed bad original nice! 
two or three good songs- skip the rest 
This 1987 Remix Unpacks the Fruit 
Would be great as a single-disc album 
3 stars and 1/2 is righter and suitable for this US Classic 
Pretty But Vacuous 
A difficult album to like as a whole 
Disregard all reviews written prior to 2012 
Rzzz Quoth I 
WAY WAY OUT THERE-- EVEN FOR ZAPPA 
Not Essential But You Need It To Complete Your FZ Collection 
Weasels Ripped My Flesh 
Eclectic is good - if you like the range of styles 
wow surprisingly average 
Not essential 
Great fun shame about the recording standard 
Shut up and Play your guitar? 
Not a great FZ album but it has its moments.... 
Perhaps the first rock opera! 
My Least Favorite Zappa Material 
Sublime Guitar Solo 
Flo & Eddie #2  Is Still Entertaining But One Of The Weakest FZ Albums!! 
Strange.............but good. 
An O.K. Album 
Billy Eddie several vegetables bad breath and child molestation? 
Great!  ...if you are a teenage boy 
I was at the concert. 
Farewell Flo & Eddie....You Won't Be Missed.....Enough Is Enough 
Is anyone else having trouble with the CD 
A bit overdeveloped 
3 stars and 1/2 is righter...another classic!! 
Three out of Five... 
classic songs - mediocre album 
Not A Classic 
Need to work on providing a quicker response time to customer inquiries 
okay 
Some good stuff ... 
Not as good as it's made out to be. 
3 stars and 1/2 is righter.. such a remarkable tour!! 
a weak effort with some quality moments 
BUY THE VINYL!! 
Amazing varied Zappa guitar textures. Great Bozzio drums. 
mwah... 
good and a half 
A classic masterpiece BUT 
Soft/Hard/Hard/Hard...But the soft is 25 minutes of an LP! 
Who is making those new brown clouds? 
Great Demo Disc but... 
Annoying vocal makes this inferior to original but true to Zappa's vision 
Ruined by the vocals 
Another good late 70s 
No it's not 
For Zappa completists only (which isn't a bad thing)... 
Is this Frank Zappa mucking around a few good tracks... 
The best and worst of Zappa... 
Shlockingly good to shockingly good 
not essential 
Are you hardcore? 
Good But Also Points Out The Crux Of The Biscuit 
Bitter self-indulgence with some exceptional tracks 
Some good stuff here 
Reaction to previous reviews 
Too specialized for entertainment purposes 
The Music Is MUST HAVE ZAPPA - but the item was not in the shape described 
Compelling crossroads 
Not for Zappa music and composition fans 
Contains Zappa's insufferable \hit song\ but also some more substantive music 
none of the above 
Love and hate 
Not as bad as it's reputation suggests. 
Some great songs to fill in a 'Worst of Zappa' album 
Not his best 
non-essential but fun 
Not one of Zappa's best but worth 9 dollars 
For most people not essential 
My first exposure 
Get The Vinyl--the CD version blows. 
Kind of Suprising that the quality was not really there 
Music great; recording awful. 
What kind of FZ fan are you? 
hmm... 
A classic? 
A Good Zappa Instrumental Album....part orchestra/part synclavier 
I *love* Zappa but this is not his best work 
Contains some good stuff despite the in-organic sound 
Good Zappa though not great... 
By Zappa's standards it's actually a 1 star album (2012 remaster review) 
Synclaviered Classical 
This  was  a  joke  really 
Who really gets this one? 
A curiosity 
Good and a half 
synthetic 
A rather lackluster live Zappa compilation album from the 1980s 
Difficult..... 
CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION... 
Can't Wrap My Brain Around This One... 
Very clever - but almost no soul 
for fans only 
Some good stuff but mostly forgettable.... 
good and a half 
One of Zappa's few mixed bags.... 
Typical 1988 Zappa...not necessarily a good thing 
Ignore the lyrics and you have a good album 
For completists only 
Eccentrock 
A flashback to the 1970-71 Mothers 
Zappa's 62nd release - get the other 61 FIRST 
Flo & Eddie Era Mothers' Music And Dialog Plus John & Yoko 
A \Must\ For Zappa Completists: Contains 2 Treasures 
TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT PERFORMANCES 
You Can't Do That on Stage does it better 
Historical Archive-Prelude to 200 Motels 
Tracks 1-9 3 stars...The rest is 5 stars 
OK but not as good as the others 
Mixed blessing 
Strictly Commercial party-record edition 
Overrated 
GOOD BUT ALSO SLEEP INDUCING 
I dunno... 
Barry's always worthwhile but not one of his best. 
Okay 
Delux Rancho Delux 
+3/4 -- Long-lost country-styled soundtrack 
Sadly fades from \Wowza!\ to \What-th--?\ in too little time. 
Never meant for everyone 
I know it should be all about the MUSIC but... 
Scary Monsters 
We are the goon squad... 
David Bowie Meet The 80's...... 
Sorry but I can't stand it! Oh well I couldn't... 
The only good album from Bowie's 80s period

GOOD STARTER BUT................. 
A Fitting Title

The Most Known Unknown 
&quot;Best of...&quot; well not exactly.

OK 
The beginning of the end really 
Not that good really

Too much touring and booze! 
Looking Back 
Moments of Brilliance Hampered by Dated Production 
Like sex and pizza even bad E.C. is still pretty good 
Poor Napoleon's Waterloo 
Ugh... 
Great Release But Not So Great Bonus Material 
Better than you remember it 
Not EC's best but has its moments 
One Classic but all worth hearing 
Nice try but this doesn't cut it for Costello 
OK for starters  but somewhat one-dimmensional 
An absurd concept... 
The Best? 
For die hard fans 
For the casual fan. 
The problem with Zappa's stuff... 
A one-sided look at Zappa's career 
Peaches...but NO REGALIA 
Sad album 
Fascination with the abomination

Should be 1000 x better 
Very Nice EP 
Ironing out kinks 
Becoming beautiful

Why so much hype ? 
Something's missing 
Great Pieces Lackluster Presentation 
you may find it cheaper under its other entry 
Non Non! Not a Starter! 
Schmidt's second symphony fails to convert me to his music 
Good but in very unusual sound! 
Great music underplayed performance 
Gorgeous but . . . (plus follow-up) 
Heroic performance mediocre sound quality 
Fast Paced and Bright It May Be Too Much for Some 
Good reading except... 
Two fine pieces in uncompetitive recording 
Few prime freakouts

A Bit Of A Departure From The Usual Curb Junk

Ok some good songs but as often is the case it is a complation with some bad choices 
Incomplete look at Cochrane's music 
This version is ready to retire 
sound quality &amp; song quantity hold this one back 
EDDIE AND HIS FANS GET CHEATED BY CURB RECORDS

Good Enough 
Curb Never Could Get It Right With Their \Best Of\ And \Greatest Hits\ Of Releases 
Cheap packaging. 
Some folk tunes still rock

Two Great Cuts One Nostalgic Cut and a Lot of Garbage 
One Hit Wonder? 
White Bird  --  a first rate song. 
Not the best of its kind 
a lackluster disappointment 
Interesting but........... 
Great reggae 
hybrid purity 
It does its job but it's nothing special 
Biggest Loser No There is Some Value Here 
Good idea but too big. 
I'm not that impressed 
It's a dry erase board 
Good as a Reminder 
Works for it's purpose but too disposable after that 
Expo White Board with a pre-printed chart 
Great for a workout! 
Not that motivating 
Good Printer - Freezes after long periods of time - No AirPrint 
Progress or regress? 
Slow But With Some Good Features. A BASIC Printer. 
Okay printer 
Basic Scanner. 
A reliable all in one printer 
Thicker not always the best. 
Thick not too sticky 
The roll is really small 
not save much 
No better than others I've used

Paperpro 3-Hole Punch 
My heart was moved the holes were not. 
Cuts well waste removal not so much

Disappointing right out of the box... 
Good printer but too long installation

Capable but not well refined 
It's a toss up between this or the Canon MX870 
Excellent Value but Driver Issues 
It works 
keeps it cool but... 
Not opaque 
Hard to straighten out 
Good Quality 
Very Nice Matt but supplier needs to improve their packaging 
Go ahead and add $50 to the price tag. 
Not the greatest 
Not half bad.... 
Middle of the pack 
Great printer - if you have a PC 
a little expensive.  Compatibles work just as good. 
Good but over Priced 
can only load about 5 pages at a time 
Good cheap printer 
I agree...this printer uses a lot of ink..welcome surprise (see my 4/30 update) 
Summary for Mac Users only....good printer overall 
Wireless with touchscreen and apps but issues reduce its rating - UPDATED 2013 
Questionable for small business 
Strange Combination 
Meh 
Cheaper than ordering from warehouse stores 
Same taped together bags as reviewer logan 
Oh Well... 
Good product for the price 
ITS ALIVE ! 
Attractive but does not stand the test 
Good printer for the price 
You get what you pay for 
Bought it for the HP Reputation 
Not good for wireless printing 
The \Alien Creature\ printer... 
Wireless but not much more to offer 
Not recommended for Mac users 
Larger label area...but will you see it? 
Don't see the point of the gianormous tab; but nice for GTD 
A step down from my old office chair but for the price it's all right. 
Nice in photos but dissapointing in reality 
Really won't work well with mac wirelessly 
Great for home computer not so great for tablet 
Received this printer about three hours ago

Love the screen hate the computer 
Nice features but frustrating to use 
For the money this is a good chair. 
Greedy for ink 
Bulky monochrome lacking features 
Does the Job 
uncomfortable to hold 
Not as good as other Jetstream pens 
Not as good as.... 
a nice pen overall but I prefer a thicker line a softer point 
You Have to Scribble on Scratch paper to Get it Going 
Nice pens but more of a ballpoint 
Not bad not great. 
Still smears and doesn't write on glass or sideways. 
Just Another Rollerball Pen 
What can you say about a pen? 
High points and low points 
They write ok 
Good But Nothing To WRITE Home About 
Longer 
Not as good as some of my other gel rollerball pens 
Needs a stronger suction cup 
Portable project helper 
good idea but 
Not really one-handed 
Limited use and awful mac software. 
Mixed Review 
Great at first 
Do not judge the chair on the first day alone. 
Okay office chair 
All the bells and whistles but still like my basic fellows P600C better 
I personally love to shred documents it might even be a fetish... 
convenience limited by small bin bad design slow speed 
Nice for letter-sized paper but struggles with non-standard sizes 
Not worth $200 but great concept otherwise 
Only good for flat non-stapled paper 
Frequent jams 
Swingline Stack & Shred Hands Free Shredder 
Good at What it Does but Plenty it Doesn't Do 
Handles 60 sheets at a go (sometimes depends) 
Interesting - clever idea not sold on the execution 
Has Quirks 
When it works it's great... 
Shredder works as advertised but temperamental 
Doesn't work as promised .. 
ok 
I prefer the Staples Springloader 
Arrived not assembled properly. 
Doesn't staple flat 
lookwise is good 
Useful but has some design flaws 
Super-light touch light-duty stapler best for anyone who can't use a normal stapler 
Decent compact stapler 
A functional stapler with mediocre aesthetics. Some confusion about what staples it requires. 
Not quite as promised 
It came with no staples and I never could get the thing to work! 
Pretty but I prefer the classic Swingline 
ok stapler 
Swingline SmartTouch Stapler is so so 
A light use stapler that the students love to use 
I don't love it. 
I do not recommend this 
It's okay - My preference is a regular stapler 
A good idea with some flaws 
Weird highlighter. 
These are okay but I guess I'm a traditionalist highlighter user 
A Highlighter That Sure Is Different 
I'm not overly thrilled. 
Low-Lighters 
Like highlighting with a crayon 
Bright but thick 
Novel idea soft feel highlighter but not really much of a highlighter 
Nice but not great 
Gel Highlighters they aren't your parents' office tools 
Good Product - Limited Appeal 
It is fine but not as solid as I would like. 
Over Whelmed by the Keyboard Tray 
Heavy. Good length. Installation not as easy. 
keyboard tray 
Heavy duty to a fault 
Good but not great 
Decent product but value? Not so sure. 
Quick and Simple 
Happy Holidays 
Attractive convenient expensive 
Unimpressed 
Failed to Interest 
Decent but not as good as some of the other brands we've tried 
Not  bad but not my first choice in workbook for kids 
Didn't hold interest 
Currently doesn't compare on price or performance with the Fellowes W11-C 
High price reduces its value 
This shredder is an 'okay' product 
Not bad but missing the \auto on\ feature. 
Swingline Paper Shredder - Good quality but pricey 
A cut above...in some ways 
not so great 
Ok but not great. 
OK but 
Ink Takes Too Long To Dry And Smears Easily 
Smudgy and they bled over my hands 
Like the pen not the mess 
Worked well but I did have one blowout 
Nice but not as smooth as stated 
average quality 
writes very smoothly a little messy 
Writes smooth but is a bit gloopy. 
Nice Feel but Has a Few Problems 
Not my favorite BIC 
Sometimes a pen is just a pen 
Nothing special 
Too thin! 
Decorated Bic Pen 
Prefer regular BIC Cristal pens 
I couldn't resist... 
Works Fine But Is Just A Pen 
Just a pen. 
Seems to me it's just a thinner pen than the \regular\ version 
Too thin; plastic is cheap 
Prefer the Original 
What's the point? 
Decent pen 
skinny pens 
More specialty pens please Bic! 
Really Now We Have Separate Mens and Womens Pens! 
Slender pretty and smooth-writing 
But what are they? 
not bad 
Multi Part Review 
Great Idea But Not For Heavy Lamination 
Staples pages no good for bulletin boards hard to load staples 
Better Staplers Available... 
Light Weight Handy Little Stapler ! 
Just ok. 
As a vine reviewer 
Works well but has design flaws. 
Okay but not perfect 
50/50 !!! 
Too lazy to complain. 
Fellowes Bankers Box easy to put together 
Nothing Special 
Good for a gel pen but I'll stick with my Zebra ballpoint retractable. 
Not as mightier than a sword 
Writes well 
Nice Art/Testing Pencil..but some lose their grip with time.. 
Lovely line uncomfortable grip poor lead handling 
Great Pencil! Update: the lead constantly needs to be pushed down! 
Can't use headphones with these phones! 
Good but not great. Read Update 
Power supply problems... 
USB Cable Not Included 
Have a work around now.  (formerly Good for PCs Bad for Macs) 
Can be wired or wireless but not both:  wireless eliminates scanning 
Good for Windows users. Not so good for Mac users. 
Good all in one printer but not a photo printer 
Multi-Function With Some Malfunction 
OUTSTANDING functionality.  Not so stellar print quality. 
Some great features but some really annoying ones too 
Unimpressed 
Installation Was A Huge Headache But Not a Bad Printer Once Working 
Decent but not great basic inkjet printer 
Persnickety little machine 
Great idea that just doesn't hold up... 
Great Idea in Theory But of Limited Use in Practice. 
Overpriced 
Just okay 
Repositionable and strong 
Very handy for clearing up paper clutter 
flat 
Good with flaws 
So far so good... but anticipating problems 
sturdy 
Need more room! 
could be really useful but doesn't store much 
Interesting Idea 
Nice Idea But Flawed Design Makes For Limited Use - Sometimes Bigger IS Better... 
Useful but no help for the organizationally-challenged 
OK 
Durable but pricey 
cheaper options for your printer 
Acceptable Not Great 
Great Printer -- Rip-off on Ink Supplies 
Good but some problems especially with a Mac 
A word of warning 
Horrible set up.  Meh quality. 
Lovely Colors and Patterns 
Divided Fancy But Not Especially Sturdy 
Beautiful Design But Flimsy 
Lovely but Somewhat Thin 
Surprisingly Thin Index Dividers with Psychedelic Vibrating Colors that Hurt My Eyes 
Only if you love the design and need not touch them often are these a good option 
Pretty patterns but very thin 
Attractive but flimsy. 
A little thin 
Cute Not Top Quality 
Pricey for paper 
pretty but very flimsy 
Pretty But Far Flimsier than Expected 
Useless Pocket 
Very stylish but not particularly functional ... 
No Pockets - Bummer 
Pretty but sadly flawed... 
Eco friendly 
A Nice Looking Reasonably Priced Binder With Several Flaws 
5 star if you have large desk 
Not a standout but not too bad either 
Will Love it If you don't need the interior pockets... 
Its okay 
Looks can be deceiving 
A little pricey 
Pretty for home use. 
Understated Binder For Work But Comes With Warning 
3.5*  \It was the Best of Binders; It was the So-So of Binders.\ (with apologies to Dickens) 
Seems pricy but it's quite nice 
Flimsy 
Sturdy. Lightweight. Potentially Toxic. 
Looks good but some quality control issues and seems a bit pricey for what you get.  Not sure about that Prop 65 warning... 
Wilson Jones Recycled Bliss Binder 1\ 
Okay but No choice in Design 
Cute but Extremely Stiff 
Could be improved 
Pretty binder 
This is an adequate binder of its type 
Nice Enough But Not Worth 8.00 
Love the style but the execution is subpar 
nice but... 
Lovely binder 
Cute cheap binder 
Some Nice Qualities Some Less So [3.5 Stars] 
Pretty but stiff 
Not what I expected 
Definitely easier to use but requires special staples 
Heavy duty could not use with regular staples 
Five-star stapler handicapped by an inability to use regular staples! 
Not the best not the worst 
Laser pointer works great but wireless remote isn't compatible with Windows 8.1 
It's okay 
does it have to be this big? 
It's not too terrible... 
Quiet easy to use 
I'm Trying to be Fair Here but... 
A good quality that must meet market pricing 
Strong folders but the sliding tab??? 
Motorized Sharpener requires 2 AA batteries 
Works but not with confidence 
Cute little doodad gizmo thing but not as good as it should be. 
Manual vs. Battery Powered 
With a little effort it does the job 
Grip is nice but pen is nothing special 
For portability and quick easy scans a bit pricy. 
Cute Yet Heavy 
need LOTS of room on your desk for this good for teens 
Love Notes 
Cute but pretty big! 
Not really sure this has much use 
writes excellent erases okay! 
Best erasable pens on the market BUT ... 
Nice pens but thought they were refillable.  Will probably not buy again. 
Small and cheap 
Random frame color is ridiculous 
Servicable but cheap 
Handy little whiteboard for the office home school etc... 
Not a big fan 
Nothing special 
Inexpensive lightweight and functional. 
okay 
What you see 
Quartet Magnetic Whiteboard 
Fine but nothing special 
Weak magnets hurt an otherwise decent product 
General advice is to lubricate shredder cutters from time to time 
Nice product but not economical 
Brother TN 450 compatible 
Out with the old in with the new... 
HP creates massive confusion with their numbering system 
good ink 
Be sure you understand what \magnetic\ means . . . 
Desktop Realestate or mouse pad? 
Massively massive mousepad 
The Dually of Mouse Pads 
For Decoration More Than for Practical Use 
Too small to be very useful 
Works well but has limited applications. 
Limited Use 
Mediocre 
Okay but they stick together (minor curling too) 
Can't do much better or the price 
A mix of great and not so great. 
Returned Second Set 
Good 
Two Out Of Five Handsets Defective After Less Than Two Years 
Busted speakerphone great range uses standard AAA NiMH batteries outstanding audio quality 
Works well but a really a bit out of date already. 
Phone review 
Needs More Space 
Not so useful for keeping track of schoolwork 
Well made cramped for space 
Love this calculator.... I loved it until 
Uniden Quality Has Dropped 
Cool designed product that will look great on your desk although not completely functional... 
Too big too shiny too bulky--but it works just fine 
Just OK 
Watch the weight limits and the old paint! 
Not Strong Enough 
Could have been awesome if they had done it right. 
Too Much...And Too Little 
Nice phone but no easy way to screen calls 
Just Average 
These are ok... 
Works Well does Not Dry Out 
Great applicator but glue dries a bit cloudy and white 
Not Really Crazy About the New Packaging 
Does what you want it to do - with greater ease due to the applicator 
Designed for convenient reuse while sacrificing strength 
Handy for sequins and flatbacks 
Great idea but they could use some improvements 
Lots of colors and handy brush tips 
Regular Sharpies work Much Better! 
Easy to use but watch what you use it on! 
Disappointing results 
Good product but it was the wrong model # 
Nice design and features; good sound quality (at low volumes) poor range 
Okay \Sticky\ keys 
OK but Panasonic equivalent is better 
Nice Cordless Phone But 
Good Phone System. Excellent Sound Quality. 
looking for a cheap phone 
Decent pencil but not the best choice. 
Good Chair But Leatherette Material Cracked Badly After 16 Months 
WARNING: BUY A USB CABLE FIRST! 
Constantly having trouble with Mac 
The printer is excellent the supplies are expensive 
Very nice with some flaws 
Beautifully made but one major flaw - the safetly lock makes Repetition difficult! 
A little bouncy but useful 
Works well and looks nice 
bouncy. 
Not sturdy enough except for a tablet 
Office printer?  Yah right. 
Great for teen & kids 
Fairly handy... not very strong or reusable 
Works better for smaller paper products 
Nice alternative to sticky tak 
Sticky stickups 
Good for notes and postcards but not anything substantial. 
Alternate for magnets and tape 
Only work for small light objects 
Good and Cute When Used Wisely 
Sticky and good 
Works fine but needs better usage instructions 
ink cartridge 
If you can find them cheap get this one. 
Nice smooth writing pens but a little light in the hand. 
Write nicely but watch your fingers.... 
You Get What You Pay For 
Smears 
Decent pen but not top shelf 
Penned 
Fussy click mechanism good for leftys 
The ink skips! 
4 stars is maybe a little generous....maybe 3 is also too generous 
Satisfaction varies with your specific needs and expectations 
Great colors! 
Mixed feelings. 
What's the big fuzz? I don't get it 
Cute... but not really for me. 
Nice pens cool colors! 
\SMOOTH\ INK AND CONSISTENT COLORS 
Just like any normal papermate pen 
these pens write the color they are 
Great price great colors - if you like ballpoints! 
Bright colors cheap looking body 
It's a set of pens 
Light colors are always just too light 
nice 
good ink lousy pen 
Liked it serves its purpose well! 
The quality is questionable but it functions fine 
Ok post it notes but prefer the original 3M Post-Its 
These are fine - but nothing unique/innovative 
Not as good as Post It Notes 
Not sure of its usefulness has some issues 
Plastic is not good + smears with gel pens 
Good idea but be careful 
A different look and feel 
Not Sure These are Worth the Switch 
Plastic-y texture makes many pens run on this sticky note 
A teacher / graduate student review 
Great for ballpoints -- not for gel pens 
an innovation you can do without 
I can see clearly ...sorta 
Abit too transparent... needs work 
Paper vs Plastic 
Nice Idea but Not That New 
Cute accessory..but not necessary! 
Cool idea but not perfect... 
Okay depending on what you need 
Kind of a mixed bag 
Underwhelming 
By now a bit of a comodity product. 
Need better adhesive 
nice but with built-in shorts 
comparable to POST -It flags 
They're adequate. 
COULD BE STICKIER 
They just don't Stick Around 
These are Sticky Notes . . . 
Bargain basement stickies 
Works as well as Post-It Notes 
Recycled makes a good product eco friendly 
Good product but there are better ones out there 
Acceptable sticky notes but I prefer Post-Its 
Not so Sticky 
Good sticky pads but wasteful 
See-Through Sticky Notes 
Perforated Sticky Notes 
Perforated Sticky Notes 
Decent sticky notes but don't give me a reason to leave Post Its 
Up to the job 
Average 
Not Quite as Good as Post-it Notes 
Hey It's a Sticky Note OK 
Post It's a Better Value 
Fine.  Small differences from post-it notes. 
O.K. product not priced competitively 
Not To Bad But Could Be A Bit Better 
Basic 
Maybe slightly better than Post-Its 
Quite Colorful - But Not Very Sticky 
Great for Writing on 
Unnecessarily useful... 
Disappointing 
Not what I expected 
A comparison 
Fine & Useful... but nothing truly innovative 
ok for what it is 
Could be better designed... 
Product works well enough 
OK if you write tiny; otherwise too small 
Great size & paper quality but... 
Cute 
Useful for organizing shelves and files and stuff like that 
Great Idea. Not Great Material. 
Really Get Your Attention 
Limited usefulness; writing smears -- Post-it brand is better 
Clever idea but not as versatile as I would like 
Nice product but has some limitations. 
Bright but maybe see-through not such a great idea? 
Good not great 
Handy note pads but better? 
New Twist on old favorite 
Nifty idea 
OK but not my personal preference..... 
Ridges in the paper 
Ordered the wrong one 
It's paper 
Pink Pen 
I Like It But... 
Are you a printer paper aficionado? Me neither. 
Good buy 
cheap paper 
OK But No Savings. 
Decent paper grabs sometimes 
Too expensive 
Worth A Shot (and doesn't include gray) 
some work some don't 
Cheap but sticky. 
Do not purchase. 
Blazingly fast but not as user-friendly as the Fujitsu ScanSnap 
If I could figure out how to use it..... 
It Dispenses 
Compact but takes getting used to. 
Fine but not a significant improvement 
Prefer standard stickies 
Great in concept poor in execution 
Bottom adhesive is too far away from edge 
COULD BE STICKIER 
The Bottom tends to Fan Out 
Could use more or better-placed sticky 
Good concept but flawed 
Good idea just not executed well.... 
Not as cool as I thought 
Doesn't work as well as you'd think 
weak adhesive but hard to peel from the pad 
Not So Helpful Sticky Notes 
A bit too strong for regular sheets of paper 
Great for Papers Not so Good for Posting 
Nice but still needs some work 
Useful but needs more sticky 
not worth the premium in price 
A good old post-it but with a few quirks 
not quite 
If you need it - it might help but... 
LIKE my 3M Post-It Notes BETTER because they STAY FLAT ... 
Almost Lie Flat 
About as good as regular sticky notes 
The notes will curl up as soon as you take them from the pack. 
Hard to Use 
Apples to apples to sticky paper... 
cute but best for a gift 
A cute desk ornament but not for real frequent usage. 
Good but... 
Not worth the effort. 
Curling edges are a hassle but the price is right 
Pencil Sharpener a bit Small 
Decent pencil sharpener. 
Nothing Special 
Nice hand feel but lines could be cleaner. 
Looks nice feels cheap 
Okay not great not bad... 
Average 
Found myself looking for excuses to write 
Good not great 
This product doesn't age gracefully 
Half and half... 
It is a gel ink pen 
Didn't Work As Described 
A new development in book marking/note taking 
OK But Kind of Odd 
Handy all-in-one packet 
I'm Not Quite Sure What The Point Is 
Not as handy as you'd think 
Colorful! 
Rainbow of color and sizes 
Like the concept but they don't hold their \stick\ as well as Post-It Notes 
notes that stick 
EPSON R2000 / CANON PRO-10 / PRO-100 FACE OFF! 
Good overall function but no cross-shredding!!! 
Just your basic calculator 
Nice little calculator 
Easy to read numbers but just OK 
Decent 
Be Careful of the Clip 
Nice report cover but pricey 
Useful and unusual but not great. 
The clips are too hard 
Does the job but not likely for long 
Really good if keeping inside a briefcase 
Useful Design but Too Flimsy 
Decent product nothing special but it will do the job 
Useful Folders! 
Thin and to easy to bend 
Good but way too delicate. 
Great results for a low price if you can wait for the ink to dry 
It's fine but only for specific uses 
Effective enough. 
A relic from the 1960s? 
Works fine 
It works but limited usefulness 
Not so sure... 
Sharp but not as safe as others 
Safety Over Functionality 
Safer maybe but not easier 
Safe but not as effective as a utility knife or sturdy scissors... 
Works great on thin plastics terrible on durable blister packs 
Time will tell 
Where was this when my kids were little? 
Pretty cool tool... 
OK for Small Jobs 
poor version of a box cutter 
Too Lightweight 
Needs a bigger blade. 
So-so 
Almost Better Than a Razor Blade 
Ooh a Box Cutter 
Pretty good for the price 
Quality label but not the normal ease of use that I am used to with Avery. 
Labels are good Avery templates so-so 
Cuts well but exposed cutting edge could slice little fingers 
Decent printer quirky. 
Too Bulky 
Attractive yes but a bit awkward 
Cute by not easy to load 
Design is superb but removes functionality. 
Colors off on photo printing 
So far so good but... 
not good for art pencils 
Stylish pretty comfortable with some reservations 
HON Abandons Quality 
not so impressed.. it's okay 
Elegant look...  disappointing features 
Looks Great But Lacks Quality 
thin padding and oddly proportioned 
Make sure this is what you want before you get it 
Sleek and firm but it is not leather. 
Would be much better on casters 
Good phone but dated design 
Expensive and not that great 
Better than the tab markers 
not what i thought 
Works well but will drain your wallet with ink costs 
Does everything really well but the ink use is highway robbery 
Scanner died within months 
Not overly impressed but they work for my purposes 
colors are off 
Not what I expected. 
Works As Described but Not Reusable or Permanent 
Easy to Use 
Product is so-so design and print online service is great 
Read the small print... Tips for use & a couple recommendations that work better for you 
Not as expected 
It's a basic label sheet with adhesive back/border 
Nice looking little signs but don't print to edge on all printers 
Would like to see bigger shelf tags 
my fault 
A good little copier/printer with one hesitation 
Great for pictures but not the printer to use for routine office work 
This printer is a bad mamma jamma! 
Good fast prints not so good interface 
Couldn't Get It To Work On My Network 
Not bad but has design flaws. 
The software drives me crazy 
Quiet Fast All-in -One 
Be Careful Mac Users 
Great quality and easy to use! 
Do you copy? 
A bit too big for an inkjet machine 
Great printer! - UPDATED 3 YEARS LATER - LEAKS INK 
Look great alignment is problematic 
Okay hard at first 
Something like greeting cards meet stickers 
good labels but templates may be an issue for some people 
Okay but.... 
Avery 
nice labels but templates only work with Microsoft Word 
Some tricks to using... 
Product itself is great but creating labels can be a challenge 
Great idea challenging to produce 
Ok not great. 
sort of flimsy 
Not as easy as I thought it would be to use 
About what I expected 
Can be a challenge to attach labels to bags 
Fantastic for small food businesses bake sales and avid cooks 
Prints nicely but has some limitations 
Not impressed 
Anticipation.... 
Great labels but awful Mac software support 
Templates Need Work 
Good Product Needs Better Templates 
Round stickers are brown 
Decent Lables But Nothing Special 
Another Good Avery Product But Could Be Improved On 
Nice albeit small arched and textured labels but the template support could be better 
A decent all-in-one for the home office 
Epson WorkForce 845 Wireless Color Printer 
A firmware update improved this printer.  :-) 
Nice not great. 
Just An Ok Printer. You Wont Be Impressed 
Glaring problems prevent the Epson 645 from being recommended 
Epson WorkForce 645 Wireless Printer with Scanner Copier and Fax (C11CB86201) 
Thirsty as a sailor on shore leave slower than molasses in January 
The price clinches it for me 
Not a bad inkjet printer but don't believe the high print volume hype. 
Hits the basics but I expected more 
Excellent Quality Fast Printing - UPDATED 
No bad but not great 
So many features so many options... maybe too many & printing subpar 
Easy labels iffy fonts 
Lots of features Still not a P-Touch 
Nice product but no thanks on the expense 
Better than Brother PT1290 
A good labeler but not great. 
OK 
More complex isn't always better 
Efficient but the UI could use some work.. 
Works well enough 
Decent label maker; when it is working 
Fine for a Presentation BUT Not Particularly Durable & NO VELCRO 
Protection of documents on travel 
Flimsy Like The Paper You Put In; No Velcro 
Nice for Documents But Not Very Sturdy 
Pretty flimsy 
Decent product but should come reinforced in some areas. 
Adequate 
Definitely not for heavy duty use 
They're Just Okay 
Great option for the price. 
Decent but with one very annoying quirk 
Works fine but not competitive with the best alternatives 
Inexpensive 2-in-1 presenter & mouse. 
Nice pointer but poor-quality software. 
Good range with a lot of design problems 
Good pointer and remote; annoying design flaws 
Better options out there 
The Dongle broke within a few days. 
It does the job as it is advertized 
The Cadillac of label makers - DIED - see Edit 
Least favorite of all my label makers. 
Ultimate label maker but battery is the biggest Con 
Not significantly better than the non touch version 
Great Labeler... Questionable Power Supply! 
Have all the good qualities except quantity and price. 
Runs Out Too Fast 
Good workhorse and easy on the budget 
Well it Prints. 
Value priced laser printing but not for macs 
A good value 
A good budget laser printer 
Longevity in question 
Setup Failed 
Absolutely No Mac Support Underwhelming Software Too Many Crashes 
Meh 
Seems fine 
As advertised 
Very Small Shredder 
works well but very loud 
A good shredder for a specific niche and compared to Fellowes W-11C 
Things I DO like: as a 5-subject notebook 
expensive and bulky notebook 
Good boxes but had a few issues 
Sturdy but not as easy to set up as you'd think 
Takes a lot of time and patience 
Multiple ways to store.... 
Each storage box will hold 56 ornaments 
Holy cardboard Batman!! 
Holiday Ornaments Need Special Storage Boxes 
\Quick and easy assembly\ NOT!! 
Lots of assembly required.  Way too complex 
Works as Advertised 
Works great too pricey though 
Mailers for gift cards 
Nice Alternative... 
Great idea but is it really needed? 
It's just a card 
Nice Christmas gift card mailer 
Good to dress up your gift cards into something more special. 
Not impressed.... 
Works okay 
Okay but nothing special 
Unique way to present gift card. 
Expensive Christmas Gift Card Mailers 
Not worth the cost 
Delivers what it promises 
Cute idea but not practical 
Not something I would buy everyday 
Gift Card Mailer & More.... 
Convenient 
Nice Printer Beware Ink Costs 
Cannon PIXMA 
Decent low priced printer 
Had it for about two weeks already becoming annoying 
Meh - its a plastic pen with a big rubber grip.  For $10 
Nice Pen for You 
Good for your desk not your pocket 
Lots of OK 
Borderline okay 
Good 
Expensive printer ink 
Decent Label Printer but why AAA? 
Basic Label Maker with a Good Keyboard 
An average label maker 
Good for an entry level labeler - needs 6 AAA batteries (not included!) 
Cute.  A little confusing but works fine. 
Gets the job done 
OK for my needs 
Epson is rather better 
Poor out-of-box experience ok after fix 
Not the best but functional. 
Prefer older model 
Good for the Price 
Good options in an inexpensive handheld label maker 
Not too impressed not too bad 
If you can get past the cost of those labels... 
pretty pens 
Nice Ball Point Pens 
Goofiness For Her 
Nice Pens 
\fashion retractable ball pen\? 
Nice Pen 
Now I know what \Fashion Ink\ means 
It's an okay pen 
Speedy But Glitchy Hardware & Software 
Bankers Box Cubby Bin 
Pretty good but not for everyone. 
Short term storage.... 
Way over-priced storage boxes 
Just a cardboard box 
just uncoated cardboard boxes 
Overpriced Cardboard Boxes That Don't Have Lids And Are More Suitable For The Organizing Of Paperwork! 
Very sturdy but not sealed.... 
Sturdy decorative boxes but not exactly dust-proof or inexpensive 
Fine but expensive for cardboard. 
Okay for a Cardboard Box 
Storage boxes 
Cardboard box 
Functional Cardboard 
Nice boxes they don't fit under my bed 
This is perfect...if your reports are only 10 pages or less! 
Fine if you don't do regular binding 
Not Especially Handy or Dandy 
Back to the Machine 
Simple but not very versitile 
Great for sporadic small jobs 
Cuts the need for a machine--works as it should 
Not quite what I though 
Works okay for a few small binders 
School report?  Great!  Sales report?  Maybe... 
Simple and easy to use 
Binding KIT not binding MACHINE - make sure you know that before ordering. 
It works. 
Does the job 
Started out great ended with a broken printer. 
Works but not great 
Compatible Brother TN450/420 toner Cartridge 
500 pages 
Good prints but sloppy quality of physical cartridge 
Same old printer frustrations 
Fastest?  At what? 
For a compact printer it does the job 
Solid Printer 
Good basic printer get something else for pictures 
Cute for the kitchen a little off in the workplace 
I am struggling to get good prints 
It's a $20 pen -- not really impressed 
It's cheap alright 
The standard sharpie pen in a silver package 
good same old sharpie with just fancy metallic cover 
Not bad... 
More of  a Storage Unit Than a Docking Station 
Just not well designed (unfortunately) 
OK as cubby not as docking station 
Heavy Docking Station 
Not very pleasing to the eye 
Works well not sure about the cost 
Sturdy 
Not bad 
Decent lapdesk better as a desk stand 
Not really washable but overall a great design

Pricey! 
Do the math

At least it holds papers 
Not very durable 
Well it is a box

Good organizing tool 
Concept is OK...execution is mediocre and its pricey for what it is

For the price there should have been more folders 
Not any better than the generic brand

Pricey! 
OK if You Only Need 9 Folders to Organize. Label Templates are Online.

Disappointed 
Organization over kill? 
Just Buy Manilla Folders and Avery labels 
Good but not spectacular 
Adequate starter kit but a bit pricey... 
Mystery Kit 
Thin/Flimsy But Acceptable 
Standard Manila files 
Helpful but not unusual 
It's just what it looks like - 9 regular file folders and a sheet of blank labels 
Eight dollars for nine file folders? 
It's OK 
You are paying for the look not the quantity. 
Really?  It's simply a marketing ploy save your hard earned dollars. 
The glass is either half-empty or half-full depending on your perspective. 
Too much money for 9 colored file folders 16 stickers and a sheet of helpful tips for life 
Very basic kit 
What I needed 
Should Have Included More of Everything 
Sturdy great label area 
Smead MO Filing Starter Kit... MO = my organizer 
Good for basic file keeping 
Nice folders but expensive 
Just order a box of folders instead 
I like these just fine. They're file folders plain and simple (though really overpriced). 
'Starter' is indeed what it is. 
Nothing special... 
Nine folders labels tips 
Better than your everyday standard file folder! 
GOOD PROS BUT CONS AS WELL 
Good Organizer does not stand up on its own 
Inexpensive light weight 12 pocket organizer. 
Good product but an organizer is only as organized as its owner 
Clear window broke within a week 
Neat folder not exceptional 
Well designed could be better a bit expensive. 
Not For Me 
insanely bright blue instead of navy as pictured but otherwise an okay folder 
Nothing Special 
Ok royal blue more than navy 
Useful folder to have 
great for trainings or conferences however... 
Alright product ridiculously priced 
Pricey! 
Pretty new copy paper holder 
Handy but overpriced 
Another overpriced office product 
pretty circle pattern

It's a box 
Not as practical as I thought it was going to be! 
Way Too Pricey 
Solid box for filing and storage 
Limited usefulness and inconsistent results... 
Nice idea but doesn't work as well as it should. 
Cute little gadget 
Great design idea less effective practical tool 
Sometimes Works Great Others Frustrating 
Overall nice...but not quite what I expected 
It's ok 
Definitely a uni-tasker but does its job well 
New Westcott Scissors Mouse Is Useful !! 
Not for lightweight paper 
Bit of a learning curve on this one! 
Works great - when it works 
Not everything it seems 
Made for cutting paper...not papers 
Good idea but not that useful for me 
Great concept but too hard to learn 
Best For The Kids 
Works Under Some Conditions 
Takes some getting used to 
Great idea but be careful 
It works but you have to know how to use it 
Good for only a small subset of what plain ol' scissors can do 
A product that works but is not as convenient as scissors 
Cuts well but (perhaps) limited use 
Its good but does add bulk to your wallet 
Average product 
Not much \higher\ capacity 
Nice printer not completely wireless 
A powerful shredder with some annoying flaws 
Masticator 
Not as sturdy as it looks

The Good. The Bad. The Stinky. 
Curled up on edges 
Could be better 
Great Idea. Disappointing Product. 
OK but Kind of Gimicky 
A little disappointing 
Handy 
Nice but not necessarily necessary 
Good concept but falls short 
Love the idea--but it's got limitations! 
does what you expect but $5 seems very expensive for what you get 
Easy Convenient with Cautions 
Eye-catching but does not stick to all surfaces 
Would be better if it were white 
Not my favorite Post-it product 
Nothing Special... 
IMHO...Meh! 
Not quite perfect 
Windows Only Alternative To Fujitsu S1300i 
Some minor inconveniences but still a decent scanner 
Not Quite Ready For Primetime 
An interesting alternative to the Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300i 
Looks nice so-so quality 
Quality is fine but the black border really cuts down on the usable space and the picture is misleading. 
Don't expect 
Love it 
Arrived warped 
DON'T TRUST THE PICTURE.  Usable cork surface only about 13\ x 8\ 
Too Small 
This a nice lightweight cork board that is in a convenient ... 
Too small to be functional 
smaller than advertised 
Looks nice but large frame makes it less functional 
Smaller than you probably want 
Great as a Memory Board! 
Frame is larger than it appears in the picture 
Stylish stapler but not the usual swingline quality 
Cheap 
Functional Stapler 
fun color but definitely only good for the occasional user 
Waste of money 
Works fine but not ideal for a frequent stapler. 
Functional light weight stapler for personal use - BUT! no starter staples included 
A fine light duty inexpensive stapler (if you don't pay list price). 
Not sturdy but stands out 
Not that impressed 
Not Your Grandma's Swingline 
It's okay looks good feels flimsy 
Decent compact stapler 
Very Dissapointing 
Reasonably Good 
Ok for a small printer I still prefer Epson's WorkForce brand 
Can be realllllly slow 
Pretty good 
A very basic multi-function printer. 
It's an Epson. If you like them you'll like this one. 
Having Problems With This Printer 
Easy set-up compact unit ink is an issue 
Good output eats ink how long will it last?

Great quality a pain to use 
Good for Small Scale Raffles Hard to Design 
Too Reliant On MS Word 
Good Product but Program Issues Hurt It 
OK but......... 
I don't trust them - the chips don't work. 
ink loves to bleed even with fast writing. 
Not overly impressed 
Comfortable pen but drags on paper 
Nothing to Write Home About 
Dark & Mysterious Colors Poor Ink Coverage 
Really neat! But really these are pens! 
Works OK but definitely not worth spending $16+! 
Rainbows 
Uni-ball pen set - disappointed by the colors 
It's Okay - Not My Ideal 
OK for minimal shredding volume 
BASIC PAPER CLIPS 
If You've Used a Comb Punch & Binder Before Great! If Not You Might Want to Start With a Different Machine 
Works OK but definite areas for improvement 
bulky and not compatible with iphone and iPad 
Price blows avery out of the water but watch out for printer compatibility 
Not great using Lion on the Mac - Large Footprint 
Newer but not a V700 replacement 
Nice ideas and lots of features but the papers slip out too easily. 
Very nice tool for those of us who still like taking notes by hand!

Nice all in one but slow and uses ink like crazy 
Good Quality \Disposable Printer\ ... 
It doesn't work on my network nice scanning claims about touch and cost 
Nice printer flawed scan capabilities expensive ink 
Works great on the network BUT... 
Printer's great; scanner not so much 
Runs out of black ink way too fast 
THIS THING IS MADE TO WASTE INK!! 
EXTREMELY user friendly interface but not perfect 
It's decent but not sure of value for price... 
Could Not Connect to WiFi 
There is better for the same cost. 
Overall pretty good printer with a few quirks

Perfect for the Off-To-College Student.  Epson Expression XP-600: A Critical Review. 
Love my Epson Expression XP-600 AIR PRINT SCANNER for great photos *warning sucks up  the black 
Slow!! 
Ink is very costly 
Does a lot of stuff 
Handy Eventually 
Works well 
It's OK 
Looks good but not the life-changing object they claim 
Interesting But  . . . 
Odd Chair ... Mixed Results ... 
Quirky chair 
Cute and easy to assemble 
Comfortable and stable. 
As advertised and easy to put together with one problematic design flaw 
Meh 
More expensive reliable 
This is not the photo black cartridge plus it's an okay price. 
How Am I Using Ink This Fast!?!? 
Like I have a lot of choices... 
It runs out quickly. 
Not seller's fault but............ 
Great Printer - Not Best Choice for Vellum - Disappointed w/Canon 
Brother ADS2500W vs. Epson Workforce Pro Scanner Comparo 
Buy the 107 if your printer supports it

HON Cut Some Corners and This Is The Result 
Good for the price

Really Could Use Feed Guides 
A nice machine but I'd recommend the Scotch Thermal Laminator instead. 
Okay but limited 
Comparing to Scotch TL901 laminator 
For light duty jobs only 
Good for the money 
Mac users beware 
Close but NOT QUITE 
Honeymoon is Over 
A little better than OK 
Decent pen 
Thick barrel 
A remarkable bargain for the price but has two serious flaws 
Reliable product at a good Price but not the best. 
Sturdy and functional but not perfect 
A Few Improvements Over Its Predecessor (The MA220MB) But Not As Aesthetically Appealing And Has Durability Issues 
Good quality but \easy adjust\ is a bit of a stretch 
Very very well made...but get the other one 
It's a good idea 
Interesting organizing concept - good paper from a well-known company 
Useful but not incredibly convenient 
It's okay 
Better than I expected 
Grossly overpriced 
Not sure of the advantage 
Amazing But Expensive 
Good idea poor execution 
Quality just OK nice idea but .... 
Works a little too well paper is very thin 
You are paying for convenience 
More of a pad of paper than a clipboard 
A regular old clipboard is much better 
Interesting Idea With Flaws 
Just OK 
They are not Cannon ink. They are not bad though and they are soooo cheap! 
So - So Price is Right 
They're pens... 
Pilot Work Force Retractable Pen 
Large sturdy pen 
It's okay. Kind of a novelty thing. 
Just a little too big... 
Not impressed - cheap feel ugly clip slippery grip 
OK 
OK pen in terms of function 
Good if this is your kind of pen expensive if it isn't 
Not sure how practical this is 
Pen works 
Good pen but design could be better 
Clunky 
So Close but Not Quite 
It doesn't live  up to the claim 
the colors aren't particularly bright or vibrant 
OK But I Would Prefer a Softer Grip! 
more water resistant than Pilot G2 but writes less smoothly 
Just okay 
Not as smooth as I'd hope. 
Flimsy and easily bent 
Large and Economic 
Works OK but maybe not enough ink? 
Good printer no wifi built-in and expensive toner 
It's Okay 
Several things draw the rating down here... 
Positive first impression so far but \return imaging unit\ a little worrisome 
Not as many features as the competition but still a solid basic printer 
Very good not great 
110 negatives. 
VERY easy method to convert your old photos to digital 
Average Stapler in Pretty Wrapping. 
Nice appearance works fine. 
Attractive 
Looks good but doesn't staple any better 
Decent Sharpener Need to Wiggle You Pencil a Bit to Sharpen All 
A portable and efficient pencil sharpener but some flaws 
Does as promised 
Might Have a Dud-Keep Receipt for 10 yr. Warranty 
Works pretty well 
Made In China - Poorly 
Nice but with some annoying flaws 
No AirPrint 
Good Choice if You Don't Have to Have Color 
Still not Laser 
Won't Replace my laser printer but makes a great standard printer 
Good printer but 
Is this REALLY an affordable alternative to a laser printer? 
The tray sucks but it prints nice 
Good quality photos but a monochrome laser might be more suitable if you print mostly text. 
For the price good value but lacks the bells and whistle. 
Good printer but please Epson make OSX installation easy 
Monochrome Printer with a HUGE Ink Cartridge 
There are better Epson products 
Compact single-purpose black ink inkjet printer 
Fine but nothing special 
Can't Get the Wi-Fi Working 
Am I missing an important point? 
I'm not sure what these are for I thought they were binders for letters. 
Just plastic sheets 
Just plain 8 1/2 x 11 (7mil) Polyethylene (PET) sheets. 
Pictures can be deceiving&#8230; but still a great plastic cover for your docs 
pictures are misleading 
Not entirely as advertised 
Not Bad 
Easy to use . . . 
Sharpens great but you're going to have to hold it down 
Ok 
Works OK for a portable 
I am on the fence - It does work 
Compact Size with a few problems 
Westcott iPoint Ball Pencil Sharpener (15570) 
It works 
Interesting product...plenty of uses just don't use too many 
Interesting Novelty but Expensive 
Its big in size but not on stick 
Good for limited use; not sticky enough. 
OK not sure there's any practical use for this product 
Great product that I've been finding a ton of uses for but the adhesive isn't quite strong enough. 
Great except for one thing 
Be Sure you Need Only Single Function! Choose carefully. 
Bend Over When Buying Ink 
Paper get Messed Up 
SLOW not always user-friendly one-trick pony w pricey consumables per unit print costs 
Good product recommended for photo printing very slow. 
Excellent prints but Set-up was frustrating for me 
Lot of plastic pricey (Canon only) ink noisy and limited features 
Op System Problems. 
Not Vanilla Manila 
A nice idea to help you relabel and reuse manila folders needs improvement 
Well... 
Read the small print 
can only use specific pens and erasers 
Great idea 
Not so erasable... 
For the environmentally conscious - reuse reuse reuse 
Very easy set up quite handy for documents image quality lacking compared to other scanners on photographs however. 
Comparison of the P-208 with the Cannon P-215 
It doesn't fare well when compared to my Doxie GO personal scanner... 
Great Quality (But Expensive) 
great tape at a really high price but some care can help 
Odd \Tape\ 
Not as good as competing products 
cool red tape for packing or marking things red. 
Works ok 
Watch where you stick it! 
mainly good for resealing easy opening and closing 
Decent deterrent if you apply more tape over the top of it 
Most of the Manufacturer claims for this security tape for lightweight envelopes and mailers tested true but one did not 
not for sealing 
Helps to supplement heavy duty long lasting packing tape 
With Reservations 
This message tape works best if used UNDER the clear thick packing tape. 
It would be ok if the description didn't say high adhesion and holding power 
Easy to Realign 
not very sticky 
Barely sticks to a box.  Not good for security or anything else. --- Edited and upgraded from 1 to 3 stars 
Alert tape for tampered package - not useful as a packaging tape 
Adhesive is too light for box sealing 
Okay but Could Use Some Improvement 
Barely adequate for intended purpose when used alone 
A little fragile 
Not as strong as expected. 
Good for warning not for sealing. 
Thin Box Sealing Tape 
Thin easily tangled tape 
Ok 
great for labeling but NOT for your primary tape 
Could be thicker 
Truly a Label Not a Sealer 
To Enhance Your Taping Not for Primary Taping 
Sticky 
Did I get a bad batch? 
Doesn't last long 
Could be much better 
Did Not Impress This Pen Snob 
Your Favorite Black Ink Pen With A Colored Squiggly Line Case 
Black pens 
Great picture quality but questionable security 
the mystery pooper remains at large 
Not the most sensible product. 
Great quality OK with my printer 
I wanted to like this more.... 
This product solves a problem that I don't have but if I did... 
Notepad for iPhone 
Wish both sides had been lined would have been a better value 
Moderately functional but nothing special 
You are paying for convenience 
Really? 
Neat idea 
nothing special but good size notepad for a purse. 
Noteworthy Note Taking 
Okay...Whatever 
Nice idea needs improvement 
Good idea buggy app 
Worked fine for me but not worth the cost. 
It is a note pad 
Does what I need it to do but there is no iPad app... 
It' ok.. 
Don't last too long 
Be careful when opening or ink will get on you 
Smead Organized UP Heavyweight File Folders: Things are looking UP 
Good... useful... but not as great as expected 
Good Concept Needs Some Changes 
Don't put them in a backpack! 
Very odd file folders... 
Nice images but missing something. 
decent printer but a real pain to set up 
good product for an ALL in ONE 
Some good; some bad 
my first disapointment from Canon 
Prints and scans well but won't print without a power cycle after it goes to sleep 
Great price you get what you pay for watch the wording of the product features they may lead you to wrong conclusions 
I was hoping for more. 
Good enough but I liked the MX 850 better 
Solid Printer with Good Features but Some Negatives 
Lift 'Em High 
Learning to leave a fingerprint 
Not what I thought it was from the picture 
Difficult to dispense works just fine 
Works fine in some cases 
Not as easy to use as flat sheets not sure why you would choose this instead. 
Great hardware 
Pen-o-holic's Perspective: Poor Man's Gelly Rolls (Almost) [3.5 Stars] 
Not as good as Sakura but some are ok 
3+ is more realistic 
Not the best 
So.... 
Okay Pens 
Every color you can think of. 
Rainbow on a stand patience required 
Nice set of gel pens often takes extended time for ink to dry. 
Perfectly good gel pens 
Great pen holder great color variety not that great pens 
The Price is Right. 
Everyday paper 
Nice white and bright 
Works OK in very dark room 
Panasonic Answering Machine will ONLY work with Land Line 
A Sharp(ie) Disappointment 
Dull Colors under room lights 
Not the best for art projects 
Good for black lights not sure about anything else 
Most colors were great - easy to use 
Useful for marking on white backgrounds 
These Are Okay 
neon but not opaque 
Not as bright as I hoped 
Arrived broken 
corners break easily 
Adequate 
For the price it's fine 
Good quality but not perfect 
Quartet Dry Erase Board (23 x 17) 
Good enough for a cheap price 
I've had better 
Good enough 
Adequate small magnetic erasable board 
Love the idea not the reality 
Disappointing but you get what you pay for. 
Nice idea but picture quality isn't great 
I was expecting more 
Left with a case of buyer's remorse 
OK - sharpener. Weak motor good warranty 
Decent unit for the home or small office... 
Great except for one thing 
Good for home use but not for office/school 
speakerphone is horrible 
No problem but its not like having built a better mousetrap. 
Comfy but no anti-slip coating on the bottom makes it slide around on your desk 
Didn't make life easier 
Decent wrist support not good for gaming 
Looks cheap makes a LOT of noise when you slide the mouse 
Wrist support is fine but the scraping noise is annoying! 
Too Slippery For My Tastes 
Some may like it 
Product Didn't Meet Expectations Because My Use Was Not Right 
Good mouse pad. Less good wrist rest. 
It feels wierd 
Works but kind of ugly 
Ok mouse pad 
Good but not great 
Wrist Rocker 
Fellowes wrist rocker 
Not that special... 
Not for all users 
Okay but needs exact table ergonomics to work right. 
A plastic sheet 
A bit of buyer's remorse... 
Mediocre Laser Printer from Canon. 
A useful (but slow) color laser printer - that would make a decent printing scanning and copying tool for small or home offices 
Couldn't get any dry  marker to work legibly on the shiny calendar surface area 
Cheap construction and sub par marker. 
Mid-level quality of construction 
Good Board 
Good Basic Laminator (But You Better Know How To Use It!) 
Okay not great 
Is this worth the price? 
Good tape but nothing special 
Works just fine but not enough to justify the cost 
Easy to work with. 
Strong tape. Overkill for most jobs. 
OK Quality but PRICEY 
Use Sparingly It's Expensive But Good 
Seems good rather expensive 
Good Tape But Expensive 
Yowza that price! 
Pretty generic 
Decent Product ... 
Tape without dispenser 
Disappointing.  I'll stick with the Scotch or Duck.  They are both better values. 
Thicker and stronger but also a bit more expensive than average packing tapes 
Good but not great 
Nice tape but I see no reason for the high price premium. 
Spine quick to insert... but quick to fall out too. 
Spine Is Easy To Put In But Easy To Fall Out Too 
List price is extremely high costs less here 
Good product but a little pricey 
binders 
Fine But Pricey 
Just an ordinary binder 
Ok binders but I did not find the spine much better than any other 
Decent average binders 
Amazon Basics Thermal Laminating Pouches 
Works Good...But Not For Me 
Not very practical 
Practical & Hefty  but a little pricey 
Could be better 
This \lift\ should only be used as a \laptop riser stand\ with an external keyboard - never type with your wrists pivoted upward 
Great Idea Cool Design But Angle is Not Adjustable 
Watch your angle 
Awkward to use for my laptop. 
Didn't work for us at first 
Lift and tilt your laptop PC a simple yet pricey gadget 
Just so so 
It's Okay But Not Really  Helpful for Me. 
Would be perfect if the resting angle was adjustable 
Totally under-whelmed 
just OK 
Good height but flimsy 
useful stand - some limitations 
Somewhat wobbly... 
Ok but not outstanding monitor stand. 
My monitor's base is too wide. 
In many ways ideal for my needs... 
Should be stronger and needs adjustability 
Check the width of your monitor's base first 
so far it is good 
Cheap to buy - expensive to use 
Cheap price small footprint & good prints/scans but no Fax/Ethernet & costly ink makes XP-410 a dubious choice for many users 
There are better Epson options to choose from 
Slick Economic Printer 
Decent printer sucks up the ink 
Minimal but with a small footprint 
Versatile printer with a very good scanner 
Great Printer But So Far That's All It Does 
Nice footprint nice look but loud! 
Workable for home shipping 
Pros and cons 
Okay for light-duty sharpening. 
Makes pencils less dull 
Average Sharpener 
Meh. 
Start sharpening in the morning for an afternoon meeting - Ok it's not that bad 
Novelty Sharpening 
Nice USB feature but spend a bit more on something commercial. 
Works ok for sharpening an already sharpened pencil 
Works fairly well 
Satisfactory 
Cheaply made. Works but required fixing first. 
Sadly not for Prismacolors. Not very green. 
Meh...There Are Better Choices 
Convenient but not much power... not expecting it to last long 
A BIT UNDERPOWERED FOR EFFICIENT USE 
No Batteries Needed 
Pricey compared to more capable laminators 
Meh... 
3.5 stars 
Not All That Useful 
Didn't feel as comfortable using it as had expected 
Helpful pad but lacks some key features 
It's ok 
Could Be a Little Better 
Just ok 
Things To Do is ok 
A handy to-do pad for your desk or counter but not refillable 
Heavy smooth paper in disposable cover 
Nice Pad Could be Better 
It's Okay Large Line Space Large Footprint 
Better notepads available 
Simply OK 
Memo pad; hard cover is not useful on the one I received. Does not support pad up at an angle. 
Just a regular notepad! 
Wish it was smaller and that the stand was sturdier. 
A promising product but it's not quite there yet. 
It's alright for a notepad but there are some flaws 
Nice To-Do List Pad 
\Snap your move\ 
Not all features work consistently. 
Problems Putting it Together But Seemingly Ok Once Assembled 
One door warped; Apparent (slight!) water damage on the top surface. 
Big! 
Huge binder easy access pretty cover somewhat sturdy 
In which I sound like a grouchy old man. 
INSANELY Big!!! 
Design Could Be Improved 
Huge Binder Durability Questionable 
Large ... holds just about anything ... not sure it will last an entire school year 
Kind of flimsy but good size 
Really well designed but not perfect. 
Rugged But Also Bulky and Oddly Laid Out 
Good for an adult but not a child 
Great but needs more compartments. 
Bends easily 
nice storage features too wide 
Little bit too bulky 
decent for price 
a little underwhelmed 
Average binder 
Nice Features but Unattractive Bubbling 
basic sturdy a little pricey 
Not 4 pockets expensive easy to open 
Average binder 
Great For Kids Nice Bold Color Average- Quality... 
Good binder but wow it's expensive!! 
Good Features But Also Disappointing 
easy to open 
Not very heavy duty but rings are very good 
binder 
Nothing wondrous nothing abysmal 
Mine came ripped 
Edges are weak. 
love the pink 
No frills other than the vibrant color 
ok binder stiff rings 
Not really \heavy duty\ but okay 
Adequate 
Expensive for an average binder 
Not sure how Heavy Duty this is. 
ok but pricey 
great color 
Generic Binder Good Hinge 
Basic \no frills\ binder. 
Mediocre Quality 
Nice binder but could be more strong! 
Middle Of The Road 
Read the Fine Print 
Sturdy binder but flaw on sample 
Just Okay 
Ten bucks? It might be worth three. 
Functional binder but not as strong as another similar binder I have 
Decent binder but really nothing stellar - feels cheap and plastic cover already bubbling off cardboard 
These things have been too cheap for years. 
Not Terrible But Not Worth a Premium Price Tag 
It's...a binder 
Okay But Costly and Not as Reinforced as Expected 
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link 
High Cost Low Quality 
Solid Binder 
As good as any store brand binder 
Durable = quality? 
Serviceable but NOT Heavy Duty! 
Okay Binder  for School Children - Not for 'Client Use' 
Okay but looks and feels cheaply made 
edges are more durable 
Overpriced 
It's good but... 
Already Cracked but Holding Up 
Great for kids learning to write but only one piece of lead? 
Mixed Review 
USE ALOT OF PRESSURE WITH NO BREAKAGE!!! 
Nice if you tend to break leads 
good for what they are for 
Nice solid lead but pencil is hard and uncomfortable to hold 
These perform well and look nice... a good alternative to regular pencils 
I wanted to love them but... 
Good nor great machine 
Barebones I think 
Heavy Weight Physically But Light Weight Performer 
Monster size great for lots of office printing 
Falls apart too quickly 
Great for home files not so great for school. 
Nice but a little awkward.... 
BIG! and wide and deep 
nice but too big for school 
Sturdy 
It's huge and has a lot of single stitch spots 
Misses the Mark A Bit For Students 
Good Not Great Boxes 
Pretty good but I prefer Bankers Box brand 
Not high-end but decent 
Sturdy not self sealing includes side legend 
It's a box 
Smaller than the picture shows. $2.60 per box. 
A good size for some items 
Good quality and the biggest box you would probably want. 
Affordable no frills boxes 
Good if you need 20 
Okay I like other styles better. 
Nada the green plastic mount was off putting 
Solid cute trendy... but not worth the price for what you get! 
You can't write on it with artist pens (or pencil for that matter) 
Fun But Sort of Chintzy 
Fun product but pretty pricey 
Nice colors 
Not exactly washi tape 
Scotch Expressions Magic Tape 
Great for paper. 
Creative. 
Expensive colored Scotch tape 
Can't write on it.... 
A crafty twist on Scotch tape 
Great Look but Scratches Easily and Moderately Functional 
Good for books in lockers without crossbars; limited appeal otherwise. 
Good enough for an extra shelf..... 
Functional locker pocket 
pockets are pretty tight 
Major Fail 
a bit tall 
Not as cool as I thought it'd be... 
whole day isn't covered 
Inexpensive. 
Thin Cork Board 
It's just... ok 
Good quality dense cork board for reminders cards and photos for your office; mounting could be improved! 
Thin but sturdy 
Good price... but very cheap cork and poor packaging. 
Pretty much what it looks like.  Not bad for the price. 
Functional But Flimsy 
Pretty Cut & Dry 
With A Few Adjustments This Calendar Would Be Perfect 
Permanent mount smashed corners marker too big 
Comes with magnets but is not magnetic 
Flimsy and hard to erase 
Works ok pen is hard to erase after 2 weeks 
Bare bone but functional 
A large dry-erasable wall calendar that would work fine for both families and small offices 
Average Product 
it's OK... 
looks nice feels very flimsy 
Cute but mine fell down and busted after a few days 
Decent enough little board. 
Sort of flimsy but adequate when placed on a level surface. 
hangs with adhesive pads only 
Light weight item 
Large 
No chalk... 
Good looking but not heavy enough 
It's ok for the price 
A little disappointed. 
Inexpensive chalkboard but low quality 
Consider the actual writing surface size. 
Sturdy but very small writing surface 
Smaller than you think 
Small but still functional. 
Looks nice less filling 
Headaches on setup but the nice prints are worth the effort. 
A Tale of Two Printers 
Not heavy duty 
This Binder is great for occasional use did not find it to be heavy duty 3 ring binder. 
For a binder it's a darn fine product. 
These binders are fine but I certainly would not call them \heavy duty\. 
Not what I would call Heavy Duty 
Wilson Jones 363 Heavy Duty Round Ring View Binder 
Only for light or occasional use 
meh 
Wireless Issues 
Connected easily mediocre print quality 
Solid Nice Looking Small 
Small and thin but good for tight places. 
Great Concept poor execution 
Quality Product but Odd Value 
Not sure on home use of this 
Probably better for office use than home use 
Works for me 
OK for occasional use clean it constantly 
A heavy duty laminator that gives me pause 
Solid but cheap coloring. Corner punch/cutting doesn't work. 
Some parts great some parts not 
Teensy Items 
Low on Variety High on Distraction 
High Price for Convenience 
Buy it for reduced resistance when mousing 
Good for light duty work 
Decent value for the money 
Entry Level 
Lots of features but will it last? 
Works but only average print quality at best; an ok budget printer and scanner 
Small printer than print scan copy and fax BUT not the best quality print. 
Decent all around printer but for just a little more you can get the excellent Brother MFC-J870DW 
Mine's going back! 
Fine Pen and Stylus 
Presto Chango 
It's OK ... 
Good pen soft stylus tip 
Less clutter next to my chair 
Better pen than stylus 
As a stylus it's great but as a pen the ink flow is variable 
I'm going to stick with this prehensile thumb deal... 
Works as advertised 
Writes well but not comfortable to write with for any length of time.  Good for the stylus 
Decent combination item but a little high-priced 
Ball point with \squishy\ stylus 
Zebra shoots and sorta scores 
Not for Me But Maybe for You 
Sleek but a hassle to set up 
Not perfect but easy to use and sleek. EATS ink. 
PHOTOS are a Pain 
Light Duty Only 
Scans fast and wirelessly but unnecessarily complicated software installation and substandard TWAIN driver 
Easy Portability; Adequate Scans 
SO FAR CANT GET IT SET UP 
Oh Brother... 
\Laughter and tears... 
Not the scanner of choice (yet) due to urgent software matter 
Probably 4 Stars For PC 
Needs help 
A cheaper (but slower) alternative to the ScanSnap 
not as good as a Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500 for a Mac user 
Nice portable document scanner 
Not for me! 
Get's the job done. 
Good for on-the-go scanners but not for big jobs 
Software could be better 
It works it's handy 
If price is your primary concern then this scanner may be for you. 
If clouds had scanners... 
Too Big 
Easy setup as a network printer but slow and expensive for a multi-function printer. OK for photo printing. 
Epson XP-950 vs Canon Pixma Pro-100 vs Canon iP4000 
Great for photos but not quite as a day to day printer 
sleek printer but not good at printing blacks 
Larger footprint but prints 11x17 
Limited amount of reasons to buy this printer 
frustratingly beautiful 
OK photo printer but I think it is not the leader of the pack 
Fair Printer 
Good Student/Casual User Printer 
Great little inexpensive printer with quality results 
Compact Unit Slightly More Limited Features 
Good Printer for Occasional Use 
Okay but not worth the hefty pricetag 
Excellent Ink 
Very decent but the XP-850 is better 
Good for a home office with great features for Mac users. 
Very good but some issues 
Disappointed 
A vast improvement 
mixed bag 
Pilot mr animal pen 
awkward design for what could have been a good pen 
Writes great but has other issues 
Affordable Bauble I Mean Pen 
Heavy thick pen nice ink 
Hefty feel hefty tag 
Adequate but not special. 
Why the animals? 
Not as smooth as the Pilot Axiom Ballpoint 
Ricoh Multifunction Laser Printer 
No WI-FI but good color scanner good printing. 
Good printer 
Decent board dried out pen highish price for quality 
Pretty good deal at this price..... 
pen is very poor board is fine 
Notes to Self 
The best thing about this whiteboard is that is is narrow and will fit in smaller spots. 
Just O.K. 
Not a bad printer but not a good choice 
Works but has jamming issues and expensive toner 
Heavy somewhat confusing set up No Mac drivers 
broken? 
Value-priced ergonomic chair. 
For big people no lumbar adjustment 
Solid chair with a few drawbacks 
Could use stronger lower back support. 
Cute bit of bling but how long will it last? 
Not Exactly What I Thought 
Cute and will keep the guys from borrowing my stapler 
It's just ok 
bling stapler 
Nice Swingline Stapler But I Don't Know About The Bling 
Good 
Bling out the stapler 
A fine inexpensive stapler. The bling feature is silly. 
okay stapler with bling 
cute 
Decent enough 
Good basic stapler with customization! 
Swingline Bling Fashion Stapler 
Cheap light stapler no staples 
Not for the artistically challenged 
There are other options to consider before you buy 
A middle of the road shredder 
Confusing - manual says not to shred more than 10 sheets of paper in one pass and to remove staples/paperclips etc 
This is a good shredder for minimal shredding functions 
Less speed more grunt. 
Good for what it is intended for but don't take the 12 page rating too seriously 
Glides Easily But Not Good for Arthritic Hands 
OK I like it 
Good Board Bad Marker 
Usable but nothing special 
Would be better if a wall hook were included as a hanging option. 
Cheap and basic for a kid 
Functional Dry-Erase Board 
Inexpensive marker board good for small spaces 
Very cheap dry-erase board 
Nothing of note in any regard 
Just okay... 
Perfect Size For The Refrigerator 
Convenient but not quite out of the pack 
Good but not great 
Arrived Bent 
Cheap cheap materials and not the best choice out there... but it gets the job done. 
Duo Action: A Quartet Magnetic Combination Cork And Dry-Erase Board Review 
Works but I would not want to 'permanently' hang this on a wall! 
Handy to have ... 
Nice Magnetic List Maker 
Basic with not enough room for writing... 
Over priced for what it is. 
Works better than the Real Estate Freebies 
Handy. 
A Little Expensive Serves its Purpose ... 
Stays in Place! 
It's ok 
Very small sections to write in. 
Three Perforated Writing Blocks Per Page 
It's OK... 
Cute but not as functional as it could be. 
Good Idea But Needs Improvements 
Just ok 
Don't like it 
Well thought out design but could be better 
When you need one you need one 
Could use a stronger magnet 
Stronger magnets & fewer labels would be nice 
Decent For Small Lists Poor Design Not as Pictured... 
I don't like the perforations.  Magnets could be a little stronger. 
Not as tall as it appears... 
Held all I could put into it but easy to dislodge (magnet could be stronger) 
It's okay 
I know office products are pricey but...... 
Like it 
Very sizeable - unfortunately the magnet isn't very strong 
Quartet Magnetic Combination Board 11x14 
A Decent Board 
Its cute and functional but the magnets are really weak. 
Decent whiteboard but better are available 
OK for seven bucks 
Cheaply made but does the job 
Acceptable combination board 
Simply Okay 
The board itself isn't bad but buy some different pens. 
Meh. 
Average Quality 
Weak magnets again 
Good idea not sure how well executed 
Not overly impressed. 
I Can't Recommend Using the Magnet Strips for Hanging It 
Quartet Magnetic Mail Organizer Storage Pouch Review 
Good magnet 
Just OK... 
It works but not too impressed 
open at the sides 
It Works 
Works but magnet requires a large surface area 
Works well but dull 
This Would Be Best for a Locker 
Okay. 
ink powders off these quickly 
Not horrible probably best suited for a tween/teen. 
Arrived mangled 
When Magnetic doesn't mean Magnetic 
Sharper looking than an ordinary white board but arrived with dents and a scratch 
Looks like stainless 
Its OKAAAY 
Requires a little more effort 
A flimsy but functional cork board 
Well yeah...it gets the job done and no more.... 
pretty flimsy product 
No wall hooks just tape - Hope you like it exactly where you put it. 
Flimsy Average Corkboard 
Mostly functional very unimpressive 
Functional but may not last the long run 
It's Okay 
Not bad 
\Not flashy...\ is right.  Just a sub to mediocre cork board 
Nice little bulletin board but self-stick hangers are PERMANENT! 
Basic thin plastic cork board. 
Works 
Just okay. Nothing fancy nothing horrible. 
Fine 
\Cheap\ yet Functional. BASIC. BASIC. BASIC. 
Good idea...But... 
You get what's advertised but it's a bit useless. 
Week starts with Monday 
A little small for a busy work schedule / office 
Great price not so great quality 
Letter-sized memo board 
Quartet Magnetic Dry-Erase Board 
Ok but not the best 
Weak Magnets 
Inexpensive and made that way 
What is there to say? 
You Get What You Pay For 
It is adequate 
Pretty cheap but usefeul 
Protrudes magnets too weak to stick to fridge. 
Easy Open Binders 
It's a binder 
Probably not worth any extra money just to open easily. 
Bound 
Good Design But Cheap Materials Make This Undesirable 
Nondescript Binder 
Not My Favorite View-Binder 
Average quality binder at a higher cost.... 
Good enough 
Nothing super special 
For an \ultra duty\ binder this is looking mighty average 
Standard Binder 
Adequate 1\ binder no more no less. 
Problems with the quality of workmanship; but materials are good 
Considering the price and the puffery I expected better. 
Just an ordinary binder 
Great file for professionals or students alike 
It is a good binder. 
Could be better: feels weak when full 
Nice Binder - Prefer The D Ring Model 
Arrived with bubbles under the cover and several dents almost rips on the back cover. 
I like this size binder for use in storing my Family Heritage Reserach. 
What&#8217;s now &#8220;ultra&#8221; used to be industry standard. 
Nice enough a binder 
It has wrinkles! 
OK Binder- needs some better features 
Design Good But Quality Lacking 
It works but it's not heavy duty and feels like it should cost about two bucks. 
It's a binder made of polypropylene and it holds papers 
Basic notebooks for manuals and reference materials 
Basic binder - good for storing documents 
Just OK. 
Slightly Nicer Than The \Basic\ Line But You Can Still Do Better 
Useful to file documents 
Plastic 
Overpriced but well made 
Overpriced 
Not worth double what I pay for other binders 
Acceptable 
It looks like it was left out in the rain 
The Binder will do the job as it is strong! 
Would have been a good binder but covered in bubbles on the front and back. 
It's a mixed bag 
Hinge was singed 
Not the best binder I've used but also not the worst 
Several minor flaws throughout make this a bad choice for students 
Wrinkled bubbly cover but nice strong hinge 
Not as \heavy duty\ as expected 
Waiting to see.... 
2.5 Stars For An Otherwise Praiseworthy Product. 
Unnecessarily Complicated 
Just Post-It Notes with Advertising for the Evernote App 
Smooth Finish 
Decent laminating pouches - nothing special 
Wrinkles a little too easily 
Thin but good 
Middle of the pack pouches 
Good quality laminating pouches though not the best value if you shop around 
Excellent Pouches For Preserving Sensitive Documents Great For The Classroom... 
They'll Do 
Works great if you have the laminator tool. 
I don't have a laminater. 
decent pouches not the best value but not bad 
Average-ish? 
OK for lightweight storage; a bit pricey; some issues with assembly and a solution 
Good for my purpose 
light duty storage boxes not cheap 
Heavy quality but disaasembles easily. 
A little too big 
Like This Larger Size.  Very Handy! 
Looks Nice and is Fairly functional 
High quality but the spaces aren't very useful 
A Somewhat Perplexing Device ... 
101 Uses for That Little Slot on Your Organizer... Okay 5. 
Why not make the memo holder fit regular post it pads? 
It's pretty 
OK but not THAT impressive 
Better Than Wooden 
Clunky 
Disappointed 
Spaces are too small 
nice boxes and lines... 
OK Magnetic Notepad 
A thin sheet of paper with magnets glued to the back... 
Wish it was a little bigger 
Tear each sheet in two 
So it's a to-do list 
Love MEAD but... 
Nice Idea But Not Much Space To Write 
It's okay 
Nice idea with average implementation. 
Great Product Idea Not So Great Execution 
Neat Liitle Book - No way to \Organize\ 
stylistic yet one wonders for what use this is really intended. Smaller than imagined yet ample space for countless accounts. 
Not what I expected 
Nothing unusual 
No Real Reason To Purchase 
Good idea -- but needs a little tweaking 
GOOD BUT COULD BE BETTER 
Helpful idea hampered by small font and light print. 
Cute but not really necessary -- a plain piece of paper works just as well 
If you live in a world of FIVE DAYS a week! 
Mead Organizher Reminder Center 
Classy look awkward usage. 
Memo Board 
Helpful! 
There are SEVEN days in a week 
Disappointing 
Keeps you organized though not fashion-friendly 
Really good concept; not as great execution. 
6x10 is really small when split in two halves 
Excellent Solution but.... 
Mead Organizher Write 'N Wipe Weekly Undated Dry-Erase Calendar 
Weekly Organizer 
Not a bad idea but not very useful 
Nice idea but it's a bit too small to be practical 
Magnetic 
No storage for included marker 
Not easy to clean 
Prone to sabotage 
Monthly Dry Erase Board 
Grear for short notes; too small for much organization 
Just Ok 
good and bad 
Flawed 
A Dry Erase Calendar 
Family calendar 
Not what I'm looking for 
What's the point? 
Great Hanging Organizer Calendar 
Okay... not the best solution though 
Still On the Fence 
Not exactly what I'd hoped 
A little too large 
Best Part is that it's Purple.... 
Either you need it or you don't 
Easy way to keep track of spending 
Too cheap. 
Probably fine if you start when your child enters preschool but \compartments\ are small 
Nice But Could Be Much Better 
Only for the most severe cases of scrapbook-a-phobia 
First-rate Lamp: But is it Worth the Cost? 
Tightly Wrapped Will Pack a Punch but Has a Short Range 
Barely OK but it does fit the Mini pretty well. 
Nice idea if you have a small apartment or just getting your move started 
Neat idea poor quality boxes 
Okay for a VERY Small Move 
Bankers Box SmoothMove Moving Kit 8 Small Boxes 6 Medium Boxes 4 Rolls Bubble Wrap 1 Roll Packing Tape and 1 Marker (7716301 
Buy it for the medium duty boxes not the extras 
Nice Boxes Not Enough Bubble Wrap. 
Mediocre performance 
Expensive decent quailty 
Perfect size for moving... but 200% more expensive for the *exact* same box at Lowes or Home Depot! 
A large box with medium strength cardboard 
OK No More 
Get The Medium Boxes Similar Size But Better Built 
The website you have to go to order skins is very slow 
Cute Concept Otherwise Nothing Special 
Unique but not reliable 
Not the fun I expected 
Pretty stapler but it only includes a single skin and is mostly made of plastic. Is not a full sized stapler. 
Basic Stapler Not Heavy Duty 
Does not staple 20 sheets custom skin gimmick is... gimmicky. 
A substandard stapler with a gimmick and a inflated price. 
Kinda cool but unnecessary 
Swingline Stapler With An Optional \Skin\ 
Good fashion stapler 
Decent light-duty stapler 
Less useful than I thought although may be just right for some 
Okay for the Price 
Pockets are great - other features are iffy 
Good idea but too flimsy to be all that useful and what's with the single-position tabs 
Loved the trio of inside pockets but two important features are lacking whether used at home or on the fly. 
I like the extra inside pockets 
Functional and sturdy but does not inspire confidence. 
It works but doesn't seem sturdy 
Works for Me 
Moshi Stanza Duo Stylus Pen 
A Little Pricey for What It Is 
Not bad - Wish it had a slightly slimmer barrel 
Useful and pretty 
Handy But Not Phenomenal 
Marker Caddy 
A little bigger than it appears 
Over Priced 
Kind of cheap. 
Nice to have but not necessarily most convenient 
Quartet Prestige 2 Marker Caddy 
Markers are great the rest... not so much 
Idea is better than execution 
Good markers decent eraser 
Good dry-erase markets bad eraser cheap holder 
Limitless Comfort &#8211; Ergonomic Laptop Desk 
Prints beautifully and I found it quite difficult to set up wirelessly. 
Mostly Good 
Could use a large price reduction 
Good printer for kids college students and back up 
Deal Killers: (1) MANUAL Duplex Scanning and (2) Paper Jams 
No Color Screen 
Wireless Setup Doesn't Work/Wired Works OK 
Excellent Photos: Difficult Setup & Multiple Features Make it Very Complex to Use 
Big Bulky and not a fan 
Not bad for the price 
Ok but there are better Canon Printers out there! 
Big and Bold but not Smart 
Difficult to set up 
Decent printer but you can do better 
Really ultra-fine points on these. 
Very specific usage - for very small writing 
Good but not great 
It may be tough and durable but I had a few issues with it 
Decent Binder; Nothing Extraordinary 
More suited for gentle use and archiving 
Only Time Will Tell 
Great quality and paper handling. Setup is a nightmare 
Will burn through a pile of docs but complicated to set up and use 
There were a lot of little strips to remove from the scanner that are applied so it can be shipped easily. You're instructed to 
Wired good. Wireless fail. 
Get the Fujitsu iX500 instead 
Fast 2-sided scans but super awkward setup 
It will do the job but \WorkForce\ = \Forces you to work\ 
Ok doesn't compare to a Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500 
Complicated Setup Scanning OK 
OK but with some concerns 
Wonderful Hardware Software issues. 
Very easy to assemble but for me at least it isn't comfortable 
Comfortable but best for a somewhat wider and lighter body overall 
Good chair meh on the price. 
Nice Easy-to-Assemble Chair 
Works well once it is set up 
Excellent networking/connectivity otherwise not that impressive at the price 
Wireless printer that works but at a cost. I prefer Epson WorkForce 630. 
Maybe Not  . . . . 
Not intuitive to set up 
Not quite the pen for me 
Pen and Pencil 
I am a pen snob. This passes... almost. 
Good idea but it's got some flaws... 
Nice product BUT.... 
Template issues 
I'd like these much better if I could download a template. 
Not as easy as you might think. 
3.5 stars - great labels less-than-perfect software. 
Love the look and functionality but not the limited features. 
Prints from anywhere!  Otherwise meh. 
Adequate 
Not as Good as HP Usually Is 
No template in MSWord or Wordperfect 
Fine for teens and adults 
Red is Dull Color 
Clear customizable cover????  Where? 
So-so Binder 
Not so durable. 
It's a binder 
Mead Binder 
WiFi and NFC wireless printing 
A rock solid label maker weakened by stupid design flaws 
Good label makeras label makers go 
Interesting design but I don't care for the rings inside 
Ninder Better Notebook Than Binder 
Is It A Notebook? Is It A Binder? Identity Crises. 
Five Star Flex Hybrid 1-inch NoteBinder 
flexible light but rings are a pain to open and close 
Arg! Same item as item #72186. Darn. It's just okay then. 
Probably won't last 
Too bulky for the smaller arms of school kids and not enough electronic compartments for older kids 
For A Low-Tech Reality 
shape is a bit odd as it could fit a ... 
Okay light one really poor functional flaw. 
Okay but I don't except it to have a long shelf \life\ 
Great for lockers not for other uses. 
Took me a long time to figure out where batteries went and hard to open. 
Adequate light if you can install the batteries 
Serves its purpose BUT . 
Serves Its Purpose 
Just OK 
Where Do The Batteries Go? 
Small: strictly for note taking 
Smaller than I thought 
Perfectly Normal Notebook 
I'm not sure what niche this fills 
A bit expensive in my opinion 
good quality but poor value 
Not quite a five-star value 
Average 
A giant high-quality all-in-one office printer ... with a few bugs. 
Problems at initial setup took a star away from an otherwise nice printer 
Grabs chunks of paper ... repeatedly 
Like other Workforce Printers: Suitable for small home office/ home school use but can become expensive 
With reservations 
Horrible Wi-Fi/Connectivity. 
Excellent Features Are Overcome by Glitchy Software Ghostly Printing 
Defective upon arrival -- waiting for replacement 
Suitable for small home office/ home school use but can become expensive in very heavy use 
Seemingly decent product but poor Amazon/Sentry Description & Documentation! 
Not so sure about this thing 
Only for very small mice. One-use only 
Expensive and Ineffective 
For the Squeamish a Clean Very Expensive Way to Catch Mice 
still waiting for it to catch something 
Not a better mousetrap... 
A reformed Kill & Seal guy (blame Coleridge's \Ancient Mariner\) 
Great Idea Not the Best Execution 
From a Germ-A-Phobe.... 
Clean and easy trap for squeamish but expensive 
It works sort of. 
REALLy cleam - but in a bad way 
Not As Gross 
They work but very limited on size 
Scorpion control results unproven 
Better than gas but not exactly a miracle 
Ideal for small yard urban dwellers - not ideal for suburban dwellers 
Nothing Fancy 
Its OK 
Quit working a little over a year later 
Could be Better 
Good but could be improved still 
Item was $63 two days ago 
Some good some bad 
Still have an ant problem 
It works sort of.... 
Good but still active. 
Powerful but lacks the ability to advance the line 
Performance 
Hand held snow thrower 
Go green 
Didn't work for me 
So so weed whacker.. 
Works well for a *very* short person. 
If you want a dandelion tool&#8230; this is it. 
Who knows if it works? 
Will attract a variety of birds to your yard but... 
Jury is out 
Depends on what you get 
So So 
Framework is good clamp fittings not so much 
Nice to Have But I Wouldn't Buy It 
Not worth the money 
supercalifragalistic squeegee 
Bust this out for the big jobs 
Not as good as expected 
Mona Lisa 
Works Good Most Of The Time 
Not What I'd Hoped For 
Complicating a simple chore 
Different Kind of Vac 
Gadget Tool or Toy 
Shiny streak free bathroom mirrors 
Not practical for small windows/ small panes. 
Works fine. 
Were a gift had to return 
haven't used yet will update review when i do. Seem durable but not thick as expected. 
Char-Broil Grill2Go ICE 
Intense Heat but burns through gas and not very portable 
Too Much Sprinkler For a Small Garden 
Decent killer 
Took a few applications to work 
A cardinal favorite albeit way overpriced (at $26.00)! 
No Finniel (Top) 
It probably kills slugs and snails 
mixed feelings 
Works but not as well as the competition 
Safer but higher priced Snail killer 
Slug and snail killer 
Slightly expensive but safer for pets! 
Slug killer on the loose! 
got item quickly but instructions horrible 
Still working 
Pretty Good Trimmer 
Good power but don't like having to buy expensive replacement blades 
Severely underpowered wobbly and noisy! 
Cute Stylish & Portable. Definite Eye Candy But Doesn't Function as Well as a Weber. 
Great Little Grill But Pricey 
Looks great well-constructed but smothers coals 
Good 
suction cup brackett is poorly made 
VERY NICE COLOR BUT 
Form -vs- Function 
8 inch self watering plant pot 
Hard to Handle 
works ok tough to figure out 
Water valve 
Not sure this cuts it for FL weeds... 
Works but is it worth the effort and ugliness? 
Doesn't prevent weeds but does reduce them 
It is working inconsistently 
Will Update Later 
Tire smell 
A Lite Weight 
Fairly good product 
Love the purple but... 
Not Impressed Yet 
Works ok maybe with a little open and  closing it'll work better 
Okay needs a modification 
Does the job. 
Light but akaward 
The teeth look a little grousome 
So far nothing. 
Certainly Nasty Looking 
easy to set but I haven't caught a rat yet 
Works but no dead rats yet.. 
Only Difference.......Price! 
Coshell COSAZ9 9-Pound Bag Coconut Shell Charcoal Briquettes 
Charcoal fine bag terrible 
Hot hot hot 
We Haven't Caught Anything Yet 
Often not \easy set\ difficult to bait 
Easy to set but handle too close for comfort 
Easy to set but hasn't caught a thing in a yard full of small animals 
Easy to set harder to adjust 
One Day I May Catch Something . . . . 
Works Great For Small Lawn. 
not so great 
Too expensive here but work nicely. 
Sharp Scissors but not much else 
Scissors on Steroids 
OK 
Its ok 
Why I don't buy Black & Decker products... 
Maybe there is a reason for the conflicting reviews 
Not as much control over frequency as my other timer 
Worked well for one season.  Sending it back for warranty. 
Great new tool to my pruning collection 
dont get too excited 
convenient but not crucial 
Better than rocks or broken pieces of clay but pricey! 
OK Idea but not really worth the money. 
Effective at raising the inner pot 
*** NOT AT THIS PRICE CHARLIE *** 
works but there are free alternatives 
Old gardeners have a hard time changing their flowers 
Only because I'm lazy 
Good but genius?? 
These discs work well but are they the BEST option? 
Okay for smaller bug catching duties 
Pretty but the birds are ignoring it... 
Three because I like the design but 
Looks nice and well constructed but hummingbirds are avoiding it 
Effective use with caution 
Basically tupperware with a hole for a mouse 
Motomco... 
Be careful if your cats eat mice 
Back to traps 
Works but there are better options for homeowners. 
Not sure if this works. Control vs. elimination? 
Takes a while. 
Good but could be soo much better 
Great product ... but NOT suitable for shipping. 
Hard to like when item not included. Quick to send after initial review. 
It get the job done 
Good Product But Why So Pricey? 
Does what it says it will but who cares? 
Really Works but Too Much $$ 
What do you have more money than brains? 
It is okay for what it is... 
An alternative pot filler 
Scotch Brite 
Good idea but product's advantages over rocks aren't enough to justify the price 
A comparative study 
Easy but unnecessary 
Not something I'd spend much money for 
A jumbled mess of cords. Terrible design. 
Okay product but not Dirt Devil quality 
Work good recommend you use outdoors but could be used indoors as well 
Good pest control for areas where traps aren't the best option 
Works great but caution is in order. 
Best for a garage shed or other pet-free enclosure. 
OK 
I haven't seen any dead mice around yet but ... 
Effective - though old fashioned snap traps are cheaper and safer. 
I like the clear top because it allows me to see ... 
Can they build a better mouse trap? 
Okay but not ideal 
Reading the warning limited uses in my opinion. 
Effective against mice but dangerous to pets 
Great design but bait didn't attract any mice 
Works but is dangerious. 
Danger to pets is a serious caution here 
Mice did chew on bait.  This version  is not pet resistant and the poison is lethal to dogs and cats. 
Works OK 
Great Product but too expensive 
It works and makes for the lightest possible pot 
Works but expensive hard to fit and you can do better yourself. 
nice but expensive 
So far so good but it's kind of early to tell 
Pot of Gold? 
Glorified Buffing Pad - Works but what's in it? 
Not As Great As I Had Expected 
It's essentially an oversized scour-pad 
Works well overpriced. 
Step  4 is somewhat confusing 
High Price Tag for a Nice Product 
Works but EXPENSIVE! 
There are cheaper alternatives 
These discs work well but are they the BEST option? 
Good for larger pots! 
Easy to set up less backache later but expensive 
Useful but free alternatives exist. 
Clever if overpriced 
Pot Filler?  or Giant Pot Scrubber 
No mess in Fall 
For this diameter the product should be thicker 
A Garden Genius? Hardly...  Good Idea- However Highly Flawed Design 
3 1/2 stars great idea and works but expensive at full price 
Help with a weighty problem. 
Good Drainage not good filler 
I'd like it thicker 
All alive but they don't stick around 
Bait 
Unable to adjust height without help 
Okay! 
A lot of effort for ok results 
It works but.. 
Meh ... so-so 
Nothing Special about Krud Kutter Green Pressure Washer Concentrate. 
Powerwasher it ain't 
meh 
It's ok. Not really strong enough 
Krud Kutter HS01 for power washing 
Disappointing 
Meh 
Okay as a general cleaner but didn't do anything for mildew or bird droppings 
works somewhat 
Didn't help clean my house but my patio looks better 
A rare miss 
Powerful but heavy and short. It's just okay. 
keep looking 
Not finished with my first try 
Has some weight to it 
Remington trimmer/edger 
If You Don't Want to Spend Too Much This is a Good Choice 
Works as it should but beware of the negatives 
Cannot tell if it works 
Looks good 
Not like the fluted version 
HUGE \REALLY HUGE\ 
Reasonable quality pool hose. 
Nice bench poor packaging and assembly instructions 
Nothing Special but ok. 
Sleek Product but Overpriced 
Overpriced for this level of quality 
As pictured 
Bus Seats for Stragglers 
Looks great but not very functional ~ 
Rusts fast 
lightweight but low power battery 
Way too hard to load! 
not great 
Kills but not sure if it's quick 
Strangles mice a few feet from trap. 
Works Well But... 
Hard to Set Up but it did kill a mouse 
Innovative design but intended for smaller critters. 
Neutral on the stars because I can't fairly review this 
Unusual Mouse Trap 
...Not Impressed 
Not Sure About This 
It works sort of but I'll stick with snap traps 
It's HARD to set up this trap! 
easy to set but I haven't caught a mouse 
Awesome Trap Cheaply Built 
Not impressed 
how to build a different mouse trap 
It Works But Just Isn't For Me 
Ugh. 
Sorry I don't like this 
Works as advertised 
Catchy little item 
No Mice. 
Not a bad product but Have-a-heart traps are easier to use 
TOMCAT Multiple-Catch Mouse Trap 
No mice! 
It Works But Requires Checking At Least Twice a Day 
Maybe our mice  are too big for this trap 
No mouse yet 
It's OK 
A plaything 
Average MTD-built quality; RM2520 is a better value 
Just OK but I probably would look for a different trimmer 
Taped box with missing parts arrived - so so neutral review 
so far it works ok 
Adequate for the Price 
not for the faint of heart 
Easy to Set 
Effectiveness of mole trap highly dependent on experience and luck! 
Didn't Work For Me - But Don't Fault The Device 
Imma tryin' to be a Mole Killer 
Works great IF you can locate the mole! 
Easy to Set... Haven't killed anything yet 
So far no luck 
No success yet... 
Might Work If You Have Time Patience and More Than One Trap 
Cumbersome not to say scary to set up 
Too much hassle. 
No moles yet 
A strong trap rather easy to use not too effective in my yard. 
Careful planning determines rate of success. 
Not much success 
No moles trapped so far update 
Trade off with ease of setting versus a stronger spring 
no success with voles 
Hasn't worked yet 
An Expensive Product with a Found Solution 
Still not perfect but better than many similar products 
Aesthetically Novel but Functionally Limited 
Kind of torn on these. 
Moderately Good Limiting in Strength and Size 
Works great easy to use. 
Work well but not versatile 
Handy when you are securing small plants 
They work... but 
Neat clip for plants orchids etc. 
barely adequate 
A Little Skeptical so far.... 
Wish it was better. 
Black & Decker TL10 8.3 Amp Corded Electric Front Tine Tiller 
Useful but not everyday tiller for heavy clay 
Nerve poison ... effective but problematic 
Not the one I'd choose. Here's a summary of them all: 
Prefer this over the tier 1 traps which require replacing bait. 
Refillable mouse killer station 
BAIT STATION THAT wORKS TO KILL MICE 
Be Careful if you have cats that eat mice 
all that glitters is not gold - apply with caution 
Gimmicky spray to make natural leaves look like shiny plastic. 
Makes leafs shine 
Not a fan of the foam application 
Awkward application 
Convenient way to tend the garden 
Easy to Assemble but Battery Charger DOA 
Disappointed 
Adequate Smoker 
All Ps and no please 
Holds a Lot of Seeds 
No complaints from the birds.... 
Two Feeders In One: A The Perky-Pet 325S Panorama Wild Bird Feeder By Woodstream Corp. Review 
It's a middle of the line review... 
Fancy squirrel feeder?? 
Good feeder but lousy packaging 
Huge and heavy 
Good build easy to fill drains fast 
Very attractive but a bit cumbersome with stiffer hoses 
Sturdy nice design but not any easier to access & use your hose 
CobraCo HHBEESTL-AC Beehive Steel Hose Holder 
Trade Honey for Hose 
Save your money and spread by hand. 
Still Waiting for Results Any RESULTS 
Works Well......... For a While. 
Jury's still out. 
New spreader cap is good not great. Is it worth the extra money? 
Like a well oiled machine..for small jobs 
Comes up a bit short for some 
Drat! 
Nice.  Very nice.  Edger may need getting used to. 
birds don't like it much. 
Not Suitable for Open Windy Areas 
Cute Feeder But Designed to Feed the Ground More than the Birds 
Too expensive for the quality 
Nice Design Weak Construction 
Painted copper color 
Yes it works fine but what is the real cost? 
Attractive & Affordable Feeder But Will It Withstand Harsh Winter 
Attractive Feeder But Seed Spills Out Easy 
Hang it or set it out 
Well thought out 
For small birds only and it's all plastic 
Ok for small birds 
Good concept tiny tray. 
If You Build It it DOESN'T mean they'll come. :( 
Perky-Pet Water Cooler Bird Waterer 
Doesn't refill itself 
Not So Perky 
Very little replenishment 
Perky-Pet Products - MADE IN THE USA! Great SMALL Bird Waterer 
Never saw a bird on it in 3 weeks 
Easy to assemble but doesn't attract many birds 
Decent for the price 
extremely powerful gas hedge trimmer.  This does vibrate a lot so not for those with arthritis. 
Beautiful but not popular with our hummingbirds 
Birds (& Ants) like it; bottle can't stand upright for filling plastic base 
It's Okay 
Very nice design; easy to fill 
OK for a couple of birds 
definitely attracts the hummers 
High quality but infrequent hummingbird visits 
Looks Good Has a Few Flaws 
Look Ma No Leaks 
beautiful large capacity hummingbird feeder with perches 
Purchase hook separately! 
It leaks. 
Broke in Less than 1 Month  -Customer Service was Great and Responsive 
Looks great very high quality. 
Beautiful but has some design issues 
Shorter range foam falls down 
I guess it works..........kinda 
Good starter tiller except the telescoping handle no longer works 
Hit & Miss 
Blower 
works well if you can stomach the thought of using it 
So far nothing caught 
Creepy... 
Think it through before you buy 
Good to use for insects and spiders 
The trap works 
Poor packaging almost ensures a defective product 
Bit loud not all that convenient to use as a duct line booster 
Poor design of propeller causes noise 
Strong ducting fan needs external power control extension cord. 
This duct booster should be installed by a pro. 
Noisy when used blocks air when off 
No-frills Inline Ducting Booster Fan 
iPower GLFANXBOOSTER6 Inline Ducting Booster Fan with cord 
Having them want you to spread it and then water it seemed like a pain 
So far so good. 
Granules Contain Castor Oil to Repel Moles and Gophers 
Did annoy the gophers to dig more holes elsewhere. 
Discontinued by Manufacturer 
Ineffective only against starving or rabid animals 
needs 20 minutes of watering to apply 
Haven't noticed new tracks 
This is a repellant 
Costly moles and gophers 
Castor oil based repellent 
Convenient easy and practical application 
Only \repelled\ the gophers to dig more holes elsewhere. 
Ineffective only against starving or rabid animals 
Works to move the moles. 
Would not repurchase 
Rusting after 2 months 
Looks good  But ! 
Looks nice on my balcony 
Cross your fingers and hope it arrives in good shape 
Not quite what I had in mind but cute 
Cushion doesn't stay put 
Not without faults - UPDATED 4/19/13 
Questionable quality 
Maybe the fault is mine but . . . 
Works fine for us in the end 
Not too happy with this design 
Mouse Hotel - vacancy 
Great design but one major flaw 
effective but there are better alternatives 
A New Way to Build a Mousetrap 
Lightweight trap keeps triggering 
Meh I'd Rather Use Standard Spring Traps 
Ain't caught nothing yet 
Nice Idea With One Flaw 
Multi-Nothing 
Hasn't caught any mice yet 
Good idea but has thusfar been ineffective. 
Helpful but smaller than I'd like 
only makes sense if you use propane 
Not 'infrared' in the traditional sense. This is basically a steamer/smoke box 
Effective but not efficient 
We couldn't get the lid off! 
Gronomics Cedar Garden Bed Oil 
Good for protecting your investment 
Don't expect miracles especially with skunks 
... an OK way to clean the grill and Im satisfied with it but I would have used my old ... 
I like using it. 
Inexpensive 
It works but.... 
so far an improvement but not 100 percent 
Hard to Evaluate This but It Smells Nice 
Black racer is still out there but not in my greenhouse 
Okay. 
It's just 'okay' 
Probably best for small areas 
Works but shouldn't be used on plants for human or animal consumption ... 
Works a little 
Safe essential oil based formula for deterring small animals 
Doesn't seem to work on black rats 
The squirells hate it... if you squirt the squirrels 
Pretty expensive for the amount I'd need 
A mild mole/subterranean rodents deterrent but they won't B Gone. 
Mole Relocator 
Couldn't tell if it worked but it would take a lot of this to go over my whole yard 
Castor oil works better than anything but it's still not 100% 
Smells bad 
Wold not repurchase. 
Verdict is still out... 
Ok 
It worked but moles came back 
Hostas vs. the voles 
It works on some things but not all things 
Not completely effective against all dogs and cats. 
My truck-bed is now left alone 
Works Great When You Also Sprinkle Black Pepper 
Decent portable power source but -- there are superior options especially for Android users 
Slow and gave me mixed results 
Disappointing 
goal zero silver recharge add on 
Mixed feelings 
Where are my interchangeable tips? 
Slow to Charge My iPod 
I prefer the eJupiter 787 
OK for what it is but read the \what's included\ carefully... 
Okay for very light watering needs 
A bit flimsy 
Works but... 
great idea but bad execution 
For some reason I smile every time I look at it... 
This is not your daddy's hose..... 
Rumford Gardener 75-Feet Expanding Hose 
It really IS light.  So is the flow of water 
Very unique hose 
A novel garden tool that's convenient to store but not quite as useful as my standard hose 
So light...but not very sturdy 
OK for a small yard & deck not enough pressure otherwise 
Kind of odd 
Extra large spatula 
Scary stuff boys and girls 
Adequate protection from mosquitoes 
Not bad but I like ThermaCELL products better 
mosquitos might leave you alone but flies will eat you alive 
Uses linalool to mask exhaled carbon dioxide; Scent cartridge & Batteries included; Remove tab from cartridge 
Major limitations 
Good Concept 
Works mostly.... 
So So 
Cute Lantern & Repels Skeeters ALSO! 
No deet 
Ingredient works great but pump sprayer works better 
Do the job but are not metal 
Okay but Not Sturdy 
Attractive design but falls apart 
Not a great design. 
Quality bird feeder; but not squirrel proof at all 
OK feeder 
Okay... not out of the ordinary however 
Squirrels not to sound clich&eacute;. 
Well constructed but too squirrel friendly 
Loved it while it lasted 
Works OK for small light birds 
Might Last 3 to 4 Months 
Foiling Squirrels 
Build Quality Issue 
Perky-Pet Squirrel Slammer Wild Bird Feeder 
Attractive to Humans--and Semi-Humans 
Great as a seed starter needs more depth for much else 
It has a nice rustic appeal but it's not very practical. 
Cute little box but limited use 
Cute larger than expected width-wise 
A nice gift and suits rustic style houses 
Don't Think About It For More Than Microgreens Or Starter Herbs 
CobraCo WINPLNTR13 Expandable Window Planter 
Cute planter with limited uses 
It's smaller than you think 
Sizing.. 
More tenement than herb garden... 
It's a cute *little* thing 
Ingenious construction a little bit cheap 
Very very small and shallow containers 
Cool But Small 
Quite small and rustic in appearance. 
Wooden Expandable Window Planter From CobraCo 
Cute but small. 
Interesting shape but will only hold 3\ pots 
Long Battery Life 
yeah not bad for a small garden 
Nothing Special - I prefer my traditional gardening tools 
VERY Short Battery Life 
Quality control issues? 
Portable easy to assemble tabletop grill not for everyday use 
Nothing Special 
Sun Joe MJ403E Moe Joe Electric Lawn Mower 
Safe indoors 
seems ok 
Okay for some bugs 
The Bait Traps Seem To Work Better 
Should be designed better...and less expensive! 
Not a Perfect Product. 
It's OK to start with after a few touch ups it's pretty good 
Not sure it will last 
Not impressed with the liner 
durable handsomebut chain missing. 
Okay but the hose versions might be better for you 
My own personal Imperial Droid to watch over my flowers PICS posted 
Adjustment to spray mechanism frustrating 
Dissapointed 
Environmentally Friendly And Humane But Has Some Problems 
I had higher hopes... 
Some improvements but not many. 
The reservoir empties too quickly and there's no way to  hook up a water source. 
Inconsistent Operation Here In Michigan 
Seems a Little TOO Sensitive... 
The theories behind animal behavior say this should work...

Can't really tell a difference...

Better just to drain and refill 
Cured the foam smelly food grade ingredients?

Should order for planting beginning after first frost...not in heat of mid summer.. 
More fluff than substance 
Mixed Results 
Some of the pods didn't grow for me.  Neat kit. 
Pricey but cool introductory gardening kit for some 
Perfect for Introducing Children to Gardening not a great way to fill the table 
Good for a beginner - uneconomical for serious gardeners 
Interesting gimmic 
Half and half 
Cute convenient and makes a good gift. 
Suitable for First-Time Gardeners 
50% success rate 
Easy to plant but only a few produced 
They are OK for starting outside 
Waiting To See The Results 
Groables kit 
Waiting to see if they grow 
Not as simple or as practical as it looks 
I considered it gimicky after the fact 
A Simple System 
Interesting idea but only for lazy \gardeners\ 
Verdict is in on the success of this Garden Kit 
Stupid proof? 
A lot of packaging for a microgarden 
cute and quick planting 
Great idea but so so execution 
An Interesting Introduction to Gardening 
A kit for novices to jump-start their gardening effort 
An interesting planting concept tragic that it's not organic 
Maybe good for educational purposes not practical nor cost effective at all. 
For $1 a plant its not a bad deal 
Seed pods seem okay but really not a major improvement over just buying seeds 
Educational But Not Very Practical

A review in progress 
Clever and possibly practical 
Miracle-Gro Salad and Herb Garden Kit 
Prefer Do It Yourself...But May Be Handy For Some. 
Grab a packet of seeds 
Good for pots 
Cute pods but too little for actual food 
Quite fussy to maintain. 
Okay I suppose 
Teach from seed 
Not too impressed 
Wait! Wait! Don't order in July!! 
A Garden Starter Kit for Super-Beginners 
Good brush 
Not Bad But Not Great 
Works As Designed 
Too small for a rat rat trap n zap.. 
Easy to set up easy to use (updated 12/15) 
Does it work? Doesn't work with rechargeable batteries 
No rats zapped...but it got something else... 
It is what it says but is more restrictive than you might think... 
Works well with one big limitation 
No catch for over a week 
Inconsistent Results And Restrictive Usability 
50 rats?! 
Zip Zap 
Is a bit cumbersome but does the job! 
So it works even if I don't quite buy into the concept 
Works 
Not a bad product some correctable defects! 
Skeptical at best... 
Light Usage 
Good patio hose but not good for actual gardens 
\Rumford Gardener Expanding hose 50-feet Passion Purple\ 
Better than the 75 foot one 
Has a few limitations 
A lot of cover for the money but mine is poorly stitched 
Easy On Easy Off 
Did not fit my smaller fire pit well 
Does \Avant-Garde\ Translate To \Costs 3X As Much?\ 
Expensive 
Fine for occasional use but not for serious work 
High class and excellent Fiskars quality but low value given its price 
A revealing lesson in the present usefulness of solar power 
Works Good but Slow 
A so-so feeder 
One Of The MESSIEST Feeders I've Ever Owned 
Extremely attractive & unique design.... though I worry about how it'll hold up against squirrels 
Popular With The Birds But Perky-Pet Continues To Cut Corners 
Nice looking feeder 
cool looking but the birds don't like it 
Only for sunflower seeds and peanuts! 
Early reviews are raves... from both birds and squirrels 
Not safe for birds!!!! --- this was \repurposed\ as a hanging basket 
Good for Smaller Jobs 
Not for fall leaves 
Very good blower. OK for vacuum 
Incredibly Sturdy Interesting Design 
Seems like a lot of cost and trouble for basic fertilizer 
Not a Fan  of Product 
Excellent Fertilizer But Spreader Stopped Working 
Battery spreader jammed! 
OK For Small Jobs 
Decent fertilizer but pricey and low in organic nitrogen 
Mixed reults 
Very expensive for the amount of fertilizer supplied 
This pansy fertilizer may work but I won't be using it again. 
Pretty expensive which I see as the main drawback. Running a simple experiment to test on pansy growth and blooming. 
Heavy feeders 
Obviously it's too soon to tell whether it winds up being a super friend to my pansies. 
Mileage may vary by user 
More cute than useful 
Goofy product great for \monster footprints\ 
Satisfactory 
Has its uses 
Works and has nice connectors but I saw a nicer one at Lowes for the same price and twice as long 
Nice hose but for this money I prefer the Flexogen line 
Average 
so far so good 
kinks too easily 
Slightly better than my other dozen hoses 
Has some merits but wet leaves are its downfall 
More of a leaf shredder than a mulcher 
Works well for VERY dry leaves struggles with anything else. Really a niche item. 
Large fire pit--but why the high price tag? 
Extends time between watering plants fertilizes but not organic 
A Big Mess! 
Cheap-looking plastic 
Won't hold up to our weather 
A Little Awkward 
Attracts birds but I haven't seen Orioles 
Tough Setup and Only Attracts Raccoons for Us 
A Few Problems 
Flips 
Should do the trick if... 
Lovely jelly mess 
Plastic 
Messy! 
The birds like it. 
Decorative yes functional maybe 
Add a cute factor to your garden bed 
Good Garden Compared to The 7 
Some useful components 
Kind of interesting to play with 
Great idea I HOPE it might work 
Lack of notifications kills it. Great idea but a bit buggy and too expensive to purchase one for each plant. 
Love the idea the product not so much 
decent but more expensive 
Good for certain applications... but be careful and use sparingly!  And keep away from small children... 
You must know the dangers of DEET before you use this product 
Good rose food ok dispensing container 
Might be a nice starter feeder 
Is it really squirrel-proof? 
Best For Smaller Birds and Squirrels 
Updated review.  Not the best feeder 
It is not going to keep squirrels out but could be adapted for other uses 
Dome is good concept but scares birds 
Cute but not practical. 
okay little platform feeder once you ditch the baffle 
It has a place of its own. 
Good for The Short Haul 
A tad small for our yard full of birds 
Not as Good as I Had Hoped 
Good idea poor execution 
not a favorite for our birds 
Not perfect but useable 
A Nice Idea Poorly Executed 
It's so-so 
Bird Feeder 
Not my favorite but... 
Not for windy areas; all the water flows out 
An okay bird waterer that has a couple of issues 
We Shall See... 
Flimsy construction suits the purpose with minor issues... 
Birds are happy but I am not a fan of plastic 
Haven't seen results yet after a week. 
Didn't get the results I'd hoped for... 
safer vs better 
Not as organic as Lawn Restore 1 
Expensive dirt! 
No Miracle for this grower 
So far so good 
Works But Consider the Perky Pet Perky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Feeder As Well 
It's a cute feeder but it mysteriously leaks. So many of the other reviewers also had leaky feeders. 
Works But Larger Size May Not Be Needed.  Bit Harder To Clean Than Other Model(s) 
Nice Glass Reservoir on a Leaky Feeder 
Leaks 
Feeding liquid Mysteriously disappears just like its smaller pinch waist model 
Great For Container Plants ONLY 
Good materials few parts no reel lock 
Heavy Solid Reel. Maybe too heavy and solid. 
Very nice look but will it last? 
Nice looking not sure it will hold up long-term though 
Ah so close! 
Works But Consider The Perky Pet Perky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Unit Instead 
Odd... 
Works fine--nothing special 
Okay feeder just too small 
Not the best I have had 
Durability Is My Concern 
Great if you need a light hose 
It has advantages but these are not equivalent to standard hoses 
It works well but question long-term durability 
Don't Like It 
Convenient but flimsy 
Awesome funusefull hose 
It's legit - with some issues. 
Nice job cleaning questionable quality 
Karcher North America Electric Pressure Washer with Quick Disonnect. 
Karcher 2650 psi gas PW or Karcher 2000 psi electric PW? 
Seems like a very well built and well designed power washer 
Great Idea Bungled A Bit In Execution 
The trimmer itself weighs 5.2 pounds without battery - might not be necessary to get the wheel base 
okay as a lght duty weed whacker/edger not really suitable as a mower 
Initial Mow Review - Spring 2014 
Keep tipping upward. Handle height is not adjustable.

Tired of receiving dented cans-does not appear to happen during shipping 
Fine with me but not so with my two cats

Pooch could take it or leave it 
Didn't seem to work for us 
One time purchase 
Okay 
Effective but expensive with side effects. 
Read insert for dosage - tough on gastrointestinal tract 
Hard to evaluate but did not alleviate knee pain 
For reducing or preventing inflammation 
Sensitive to this product 
Horse pills with dubious effects 
It really worked!  But bad side effects for me now on Tinycaps 
Didn't  help my joint pain at all 
Worth a try but I won't continue using

I don't know if these are doing anything for my dogs.

It does the job but it's a little messy 
a bit flimsy 
Decent tumbler- but avoid the seperator 
The tumbler itself is excellent.  The kit is not your best deal. 
Cleans outside of the brass but possible lead exposure is concerning 
I bought it because I give my cases to someone else to reload and I didn't want to handle all that dirty brass. It does a good j 
I was disappointed I've seen ones made in china that were better

I think there are better truly cooperative games out there

More A Learning Activity Than A Game 
Fun once or twice but doesn't really hold attention

OKAY TRAIN 
Not a Puzzle - More a Model 
More model than puzzle 
A step by step project challenge is in getting the pieces to stay 
A 3D building set; not a 3D puzzle. 
More of a Model than Puzzle 
Not for me 
Okay but not what we expected... 
Not so much a puzzle as it is a build-by-numbers model 
Not really a puzzle 
3-D puzzle 
The word \puzzle\ is a bit misleading... 
Not quite like other ravensburger puzzles. 
Great Concept For A Puzzle But Flimsy Design 
Good fun product but wished.. 
Really Didn't Enjoy This 
Pleasing Puzzle but Pieces too Interchangeable 
Another quality Ravensburger Puzzle 
For Older Kids 
Gorgeous but difficult 
Cool not as cool as it appears 
while age six and up might be a stretch a teen and adult group not tv addicted might find this diverting 
Nice but too easy 
Good puzzle but 3D effect is minimal 
My 5 year old did it in 15 minutes 
HUGE puzzle and too many pieces can connect even when they don't actually go together 
Be forewarned; finger cramps and strained hearing come with these entertaining little creatures... 
Now I'm thinking about being one for Halloween. 
A bit disappointing...

Easier use than older model still not much you can do with it 
A childhood wish fulfilled 
Nostalgic but not practical 
Ok 
pam 
Has not improved with age! 
Definitely a toy oven 
My daughter loves this price for extras not so much!!! 
For a child this is a great little oven. 
Great minifigs but a so-so speeder 
Not A Set Designed For Play 
Not sure of the appeal

Decent doll added expense can be offputting

Fun for a bit but imagination trumps simulation 
Great for the imagination not a \learning\ toy 
Good toy much loved enough room for two to play 
Bought for my daughter 
The wheel just doesn't stay on. Frustrating. 
Engages ANY Child 
Should have been more 
Fun set with lots of play but overpriced 
Not the greatest set by far and beware of false list price

Storage & carry along 
Better Than The Trunkie! 
Bag is Flat 
Serve the purpose but smell 
Not the same as the organizer tote for Trunki! 
its ok 
Great for about 5 minutes 
Not suitable for a 2 year old 
Not suitable for grass 
For the price get a bubble mower.

A good starter project 
This is not a toy for the age group indicated 
Fun but no Transformation!!!! 
cute idea 
Not as good as Wilson and Brewster.

Parachute Problems 
Really not for younger kids at all - unless you like work 
wish it was slightly bigger 
Great thought - but someone didn't think it all the way through. 
An OK case...but rather small 
Not what I expected. 
Ideal for discriminating younger Jedi 
Lightweight pretty but no substance 
Decent Starter Set 
Love Beyblade but the stadium's no fun...

crap 
A Major Step Back

Innovative in spots - It really gets 2 1/2 stars... 
Too Bad.......The Possibilities Were Nearly Endless 
Very Mediocre.

Atv Offroad Fury  (PS2) 
Sim Theme Park all over again 
Great Atmosphere and fun if you like to jump..and Jump...and 
Refreshingly &quot;atmospheric&quot; but disappointing in the end 
Great atmosphere is hampered by a slow pace 
Too Unbalanced. 
Missing something 
If it's going to be Dune it should at least be Dune! 
Low artificial intelligence drags it down. 
Annoyed 
How many more can you have?

I wanted to re-visit Myst again.... 
Runs Fine on my System But a Little Slow 
Not a bad game fot it's day but it's looking very dated 
An oldie but not neccessarily a baddie 
Fun 
Fun but very dated 
Great when released but dated by today's standards 
Good concept but with drawbacks 
O.k.

Playable Anime

Throw a party invite your friends in! 
Nice objects but doesn't stack up to other expansions. 
Nice try ID 
FUN GAMES horrible controll 
I've Played Better

Better'n 2K1.  Kinda.--A Red Sox Fan 
We just DON'T CARE about Knuckles or Amy 
Sonic is Cool 
More like Crazy Taxi 1.1 
whatever 
So boring 
Stick With The First One 
Fun for a while but a game with NO depth is destined to fail 
One Question actually two 
Honestly I thought the 1st was better but still average.. 
I'll take the good with the bad... 
a rare miss for Konami 
Ok worth it if you can find it cheap 
It's about 2 years behind the rest but fun. 
Just OK 
Great Plotline Carries Sub-Par Gameplay 
An great storyline set in a mediocre game. 
Wow but oh????????

Good Game. Too short... 
Decent but disappointing 
Great choice of games unfortunately one fatal flaw ruins it... 
Classic games but not a classic experience. 
A mixed bag 
really not necessary. 
A good challenge - but buy the DVD 
On second thought worth playing 
Good story nice graphics very hard puzzles.  &quot;Expert&quot; game 
Nonsensical puzzles. Get the DVD version. 
Good Scenery Hard Puzzles That Require Math Terrible Accents 
I'm sure it's pretty good 
Not as good as I had hoped 
Great...if you're into napoleanics. 
Okay

A classic. 
Great

Overdone to the Extreme 
Star Wars Deserves Better... 
Pretty good for fans of the genre... 
fast fun lots of weapons nice characters cool levelsetc 
Could have been much better. 
Very funny but nothing new 
A noble attempt but my least favorite MI game 
Great concept! Bad implementation... 
classic old game 
Not what I was expecting 
Great for enthusiasts 
well not very bad 
Fun for train-lovers but not the rest of us 
good gamevery creepy and pretty hard 
Slow but creepy 
Nice graphics 
Good enough that I wish it was better. 
Average 
A little hard to play on the PSP but the game itself is great 
great game 
Beautifully done but ultimately disappointing... 
I can't really love this game 
mediocre 
UGH 
Really good 
Don't let the 3 stars fool you. 
Nicely Done But Far Too Short & Repetitive. 
Good If You Have A Lot of Time On Your Hands 
Good No More No Less 
Overpriced 
Great game with fast boredom rate 
It's hard to have fun at 70 mph 
Game of it's years. 
Good game for two or more players. 
Fun game but gets old quick 
Fun.. for a limited time 
Good game...but... 
O.K. 
Good game but somewhat lacking.... 
A classic arcade game. 
Kind of Dull! 
Super Mario Advanced 
Super Mario Bros. 2 for dummies. 
The remake of the remake of the remake 
AVERAGE GAME 
3/5 
I found this to be disappionting. 
Great classic revived but... 
Eh. An original Mario for the GBA would be much better. 
Not Enthused... 
AC adapter 
Comfortable and Beautiful but the SP version is a Better Purchase 
It was a good start... 
It's Great if You Can See It 
A good system that could use some work! 
A Decent Handheld 
Great Graphics poor visability. 
Terrible PLEASE READ 
Super game fantastic graphics poor turning few hovercars

brings little for single-player users 
Hmmmm...what can I say 
Mediocre game

Final Answer!! 
Big New Idea for the First Person Shooter Genre 
Join the revolution get red faction! 
Not As Good As It Should Be 
I think I figured out why I got this for $3.99 complete. 
old 
Come to Mars View a Load Screen 
Not Sure 
Be Wary of Rayman... 
OK Adiition to Half-Life 
Really Good but way too easy and short - but the H.D. Pack Rocks! 3.5 stars! 
None-too-thrilled 
Will BS gonna keep this series half alive? Yes. 
Way easy 
Good idea but way to short. 
Take my advice 
New levels and new challenges in both good and bad ways but pales compared to the other expansion 
Half-Life: Blue Shift 
Fun a bit too short not quite worth the $$$ 
I'm disapionted with this expansion. 
Average game in the Final Fantasy series 
3-and-a-half-stars; nostalgia 
Fun but shallow 
Good but short and cheap in places 
Houston we have a problem. Our A button is wearing out! 
research this game before you buy 
Okay Game! 
Not bad but not that good either. 
Kinda boring 
Not bad but not good. 
Glorified Version of Tetris 
Mario Kart Clone less than famous characters new modes 
Recommended only for those with a GBA light. 
What's all the fuss? 
Good but room for improvements 
Replicating the magic of Symphony is not so easy... 
Just Okay 
Surprisingly fun for a generic game. 
i haven't had it long so i can't really judge... 
Fantastic game until you see the in ring action... 
Not Much Wireless Without The Rumble 
Okay 
this was a good game 
Great game but needs something... 
Well it's a heck of a lot better than the previous games... 
Decent 
Fun for all DBZ fans! 
A flawed single player game. 
Love it but it shoulda had improvments and the whole saga 
Great presentation but the gameplay needs improving 
No lasting appeal whatsoever 
Same great gameplay if you can get past the graphics 
An  Average Game !!!!!! 
good game 
Pretty Cool 
A Fun Fast Racer without a Lot of Depth 
A reasonable alternative to GHOST RECON. 
A hit and a miss. 
Let's be different 
Decent Fright Factor But Not on Resident Evil's Level 
Not sure about this game 
It's really good but... 
an annoying disgrace 
On the better side of Average. 
dont judge a game by its title 
Great plot mediocre everything else... 
Skip this one and the second one and jump right to part III. 
Great RPG for any RPG gamer 
eh 
Not Bad But Certainly Not Great 
Darn my eyes why don't I like this game? 
It is Evident Why I Ignored This For 11 Years. 
Decent game especially found at a decent price 
Some good game play...some hype though 
Lots of Blood - Bordering on Gratuitous 
A fun game but mine feezed on 8th level 
Missing a lot of features 
colin mcrae rally 3 
So near greatness but gets lapped to average 
ok rally game 
Almost 
Fairly Decent... 
Enternaining 
A Webslinging OK time 
Could have been great 
Definitely a Rental 
Fun fun fun - best Spidey game to date 
BETTER THAN THE FIRST GAME. 
Nostalgia quenched 
Great but......... 
Great games... two of them anyway. 
High Scores are KEY for these games 
You can't save your high scores 
Worth the $$$... 
Game came dirty but in the end it works 
This is an OK game. 
Um.... 
O.K. Game but its missing something 
Incomplete 
Better than the stink of MK3 
A typical RPG for the Gameboy 
Problematic yet strangely attractive nostalgic 
Hardest game in history 
Mortal Kombat 2 review 
For MK Fans Not For Casual Gamers 
This game really did not live up to the hype 
This entry fell a bit short..... 
ok 
Good System but Expect to Spend at Least $50 for Each Great Title. 
Hard to reccomend 
Interesting console 
Don't be fooled by the high ratings 
Average side scroller comic beat 'em up fare 
Decent but could have been better. 
When the computer cheats the game isn't fun anymore. 
Step 1. TURN OFF THE COMMENTARY 
Tony2 
GT Advance 
good challenge 
Not Quite As Good as It Appears 
LIMITED PLAY 
A good game but could be tweaked more 
Twisted Metal 2 still better 
Slightly Disappointed 
Do NOT buy for single-player 
why so dark&gt;?? 
Not much new but a solid implementation 
Best in the series but. . . 
Great game lacking depth 
GBA LInk Cable 
hi 
Occasionally behaves a little temperamental 
It's good 
Not quite James Bond 
NEAT GAME! Just way too short. 
Good game.  Nothing unexpected. 
can be addicting 
I Wish Better Graphics Weren't the Only Positive Addition 
Interesting and fun but pales in contrast to competition... 
Too slow 
Change my mind? 
Decent but not well balanced 
3.5 stars actually 
This game was okay 
Not my type of game 
I was expecting more from a sequel for a classic game. 
I liked Civ II a lot better 
Started out good but... 
mediocre 
Fun at times but incredibly annoying! 
Lots of changes to Civ 2 - some good some not so good. 
A bit more complicated.... 
Good but not great 
Somewhat decent FPS for the GBA 
Beautiful but not hugely satisfying 
It's early but it's not looking good. 
One of the best ideas for a MMORPG 
A good sequel for those who liked the first 
Concept is there but the game is lacking 
Both terrific and terrible. 
Great Graphics but a bit too busy 
It's good and it's not French (yet) 
You've Been Warned: Not a True RPG 
Not what the world was waiting for 
This game aint for me. 
Nice graphics shame about the game 
Nice atmosphere - tedious gameplay 
good dungeon crawl 
hey did anybody know this was made into a movie... 
How original can lucas be ? 
the pc game equal to star wars chess 
Star Wars RTS 
So Repetitive! 
Falls short 
It takes more than the Force to become a Jedi... 
a classic but probably not worth too much time or money 
Great game but some issues drag down the hype. 
Yes for the music and graphics 
A Worthy Sequel but lacking overall. 3 Stars. 
The Best of Times the Worst of Times 
Better than Gold and Silver but not by much 
Pikadissapointment 
Pokemon Crystal version-only for Game Boy Color 
Bloody Roar 3 coulda been better.....although it was good. 
Great looking but dulls easily 
A decent but thin fighter 
So So Fun for Classic Enthusiasts 
Great old games ! 
lets clear up a few things. 
It's Okay But Game Shark Could've Done A Little Better. 
Good Collection but Could be Better... 
Good variety of play Pac Man is Pac Man 
Great game but not perfect 
I only wish I could play 
Classic games...not so classic load times... 
Big title reissue draws little enthusiasm 
great rental decent buy 
A decent thrid party memory card that does what it's designed to do 
The Memory Card is for the Controller So I can save and load games. 
Its a playstation one memory card ! 
A Symbol Of A Bygone Era In Gaming 
Short but it works 
Intec Component AV Cable PS2

Red Shelled Crash!!! 
Great Graphics Poor Play.
