Cheap Apple charger knock-off 
charger rate 
It's ok for what I needed it for. 
Awesome A2DP good volume & fit; one FATAL flaw 
I didn't care for it -- the controls are too small to comfortably use

Decent sound but the charger and manual are big failures 
A good value overall with mixed call quality and tiny buttons

Seriously doubt this is an OEM pod. 
Kinda bulky you're better off with a standard USB charger and an OEM cable 
Be careful it is what you were looking for. 
Works for a little while

Okay product 
Average 
works for all usb cords! 
Not well suited for a car with road noise. 
Works Fairly Well 
Hard to install without bubbles 
DOES NOT CHARGE HP TOUCHPAD 
Like the basic product. 
Failed after 9 months 
Handy but .... 
imitation 
its ok 
Works good 
Small and good power output; some fit problems 
Know the limitations 
It does work somewhat. 
Delicate and consumes too much space 
Significant change makes this cradle not as good as it used to be 
--UPDATED REVIEW-- 
It is OK. Not much of adjusting angles 
Very easy to apply. Privacy works can't see through it. 
bleh 
ok 
Good. Not great. 
Ok 
Eh 
Just okay. 
Good 
Ok product just doesn't last very long. 
Great protection 
Works 
Does the job 
Guards against dings and scratches 
No lint cleaning cloth! 
okay 
What 
northing special 
Too hard to get on 
Its a screen protector... 
looks nice but does nothing to protect your iphone 
lasts about 6 months. 
Blackberry 8520 
it's ok 
DISAPPOINTED 
Wasn't for me 
A cell phone as anyone else. 
Not a smartphone pretty good if it were the year 2006 
Bought as a back up phone for my son. 
Bluetooth connectivity work well just needs some refinement for the sound quality. 
Tenqa. Tenga?  Tonka?  What?!? 
2.5 Stars - Simple Bluetooth Speaker With Average Sound Quality 
Gets the job done 
Convenient but mediocre sound 
Decent speakers light but need to keep bluetooth close 
Great sound & loud for music but not quite on par for calls 
eh it's alright 
Brilliant Color but Only Protects Against Scratches 
Well the color is ok but it's clear and darker and not as shiny and pretty. Also this is one of those cheap covers ... 
Limited Output Power -- Beware Newer Phones 
The little charger that could (get stuck) 
Still in Box 
Three Stars 
Meh 
OK but spacing isn't as good as others 
Very thin fits a passport overpriced. 
Too dificult to apply. 
Case coul not fit the phone 
it's ok 
The best bluetooth that I've found so far but not perfect 
OK device *if* it was delivered w/ear buds - seller did not/will not provide 
Ok product but expensive (if purchasing it) and do you really need it? 
interesting concept poor execution 
It's *beeping* charging! Hope you have a *beeping* Iphone otherwise you're out of *beeping* luck. 
Needs more compatibility expensive with additional purchases. 
An \A\ for design but not sure if it's worth it for the $ 
Inventive but Impractical 
Very useful charging station with one catch... 
Almost a great product 
Charges perfectly but some design flaws hindered my love 
It charges 
Convenient tool...with an ugly design 
This Novelty Charger has a LONG way to go to be Useful! 
Good concept 
Another unfinished product hit the market. 
Okay for multiple phones not so much for one 
The Novelty Wears Off Quickly 
Great idea for a household with multiple cell phones BUT it can only be used for specific phones 
Nice with some major limitations. Very good for desk use. 
The \Power Sleeve\ doesn't add up to convenience or savings 
Not what I expected 
Similar to the Powermat Cheaper But With Similar Drawbacks 
Works Fine but has a couple limitations. 
Works OK But A Little Bit Inconvenient 
Charging Made Simple - But With A Tradeoff And Expensive 
A GOOD CHOICE FOR CHARGING MATS 
Duracells' Charge 
Great idea poor execution

Necessary Evil 
Works well (enough) for iphone 4 
Good but scratches 
It's only front protectors! 
Practical BUT... 
Basic Case. Decent Price. But I'm Just Not a Fan of Silicone Cases. 
Better than My Other Silicone Generic. Still Prefer to Use a Bumper Case. 
Fits 4S but really loose 
Inferior to other AmazonBasics case 
A little loose 
I won't purchase again! 
Only O.K.

requires non-standard charger 
no adapter for iPhone...?! 
Works but very slow

Not like the original but ok 
White line on top and side 
Used for 2 years 
Slightly Better Than *Average* Unit...Pairs With Droid 1... 
Plantronics Bluetooth Speakerphone 
I've always loved plantronics but amazon also sells blue ant

good but needs small improvments 
So far so good 
Not enough power 
Charges your gadgets something broke inside. 
the good the bad the ugly 
Affordable and does the job 
Ok for the price 
Samsung WEP470 - almost great. 
OK in-ear headphones but lacks bass 
ALLRIGHT 
Quality is good but support is not 
Easy to use product. Lack of detail in description. 
Second one I bought 
Would be better if it included another blue prying tool 
Tools for Blackberry phones 
Passable but there are better sets for the price 
Good for single use 
Good for one use?

Mixed Feelings...

Works but has a high pitched noise when you plug in devices. 
It's okay. 
Seidio Innocell Battery for Palm Pre ...coulda been a 5-star 
Looking good 
Candy Shell - One flaw

A great Blackberry 
Good but still needs work 
Bose quality but didn't fit my ears 
Okay product 
Average 
works for all usb cords! 
Not well suited for a car with road noise. 
Works Fairly Well 
Hard to install without bubbles 
DOES NOT CHARGE HP TOUCHPAD 
Like the basic product. 
Failed after 9 months 
Handy but .... 
imitation 
its ok 
Works good 
Small and good power output; some fit problems 
Know the limitations 
It does work somewhat. 
Delicate and consumes too much space 
Significant change makes this cradle not as good as it used to be 
--UPDATED REVIEW-- 
It is OK. Not much of adjusting angles 
Very easy to apply. Privacy works can't see through it. 
bleh 
ok 
Good. Not great. 
Ok 
Eh 
Just okay. 
Good 
Ok product just doesn't last very long. 
Great protection 
Works 
Does the job 
Guards against dings and scratches 
No lint cleaning cloth! 
okay 
What 
northing special 
Too hard to get on 
Its a screen protector... 
looks nice but does nothing to protect your iphone 
lasts about 6 months. 
Blackberry 8520 
it's ok 
DISAPPOINTED 
Wasn't for me 
A cell phone as anyone else. 
Not a smartphone pretty good if it were the year 2006 
Bought as a back up phone for my son. 
Bluetooth connectivity work well just needs some refinement for the sound quality. 
Tenqa. Tenga?  Tonka?  What?!? 
2.5 Stars - Simple Bluetooth Speaker With Average Sound Quality 
Gets the job done 
Convenient but mediocre sound 
Decent speakers light but need to keep bluetooth close 
Great sound & loud for music but not quite on par for calls 
eh it's alright 
Brilliant Color but Only Protects Against Scratches 
Well the color is ok but it's clear and darker and not as shiny and pretty. Also this is one of those cheap covers ... 
Limited Output Power -- Beware Newer Phones 
The little charger that could (get stuck) 
Still in Box 
Three Stars 
Meh 
OK but spacing isn't as good as others 
Very thin fits a passport overpriced. 
Too dificult to apply. 
Case coul not fit the phone 
it's ok 
The best bluetooth that I've found so far but not perfect 
OK device *if* it was delivered w/ear buds - seller did not/will not provide 
Ok product but expensive (if purchasing it) and do you really need it? 
interesting concept poor execution 
It's *beeping* charging! Hope you have a *beeping* Iphone otherwise you're out of *beeping* luck. 
Needs more compatibility expensive with additional purchases. 
An \A\ for design but not sure if it's worth it for the $ 
Inventive but Impractical 
Very useful charging station with one catch... 
Almost a great product 
Charges perfectly but some design flaws hindered my love 
It charges 
Convenient tool...with an ugly design 
This Novelty Charger has a LONG way to go to be Useful! 
Good concept 
Another unfinished product hit the market. 
Okay for multiple phones not so much for one 
The Novelty Wears Off Quickly 
Great idea for a household with multiple cell phones BUT it can only be used for specific phones 
Nice with some major limitations. Very good for desk use. 
The \Power Sleeve\ doesn't add up to convenience or savings 
Not what I expected 
Similar to the Powermat Cheaper But With Similar Drawbacks 
Works Fine but has a couple limitations. 
Works OK But A Little Bit Inconvenient 
Charging Made Simple - But With A Tradeoff And Expensive 
A GOOD CHOICE FOR CHARGING MATS 
Duracells' Charge 
Great idea poor execution 
This is the future 1st version.  Perfect for a gadget person. 
Easy To Use But Likely Not Useful For Everyone 
the idea is good...but 
replacement cell phone battery 
it works fine 
It's a battery 
Pantech USB Data Cable 
Works....most of the time 
Pretty at first but did hold up for long. 
Zebra Bling Case 
Works well but structural flaw 
Wrong case 
BB case 
It's a good phone but did not make me \very\ happy 
Great For Nerds -- Too Little Too Late To Be A Mass-Market Competitor 
Incredible potential. Substandard execution. 
N900: Think of it as a mini computer that can make phone calls on the side 
long way too go 
It's a brick 
Lots of promise but will it be fulfilled? 
I like the mirror sometimes.. but in the sun you can't see anything

Necessary Evil 
Works well (enough) for iphone 4 
Good but scratches 
It's only front protectors! 
Practical BUT... 
Basic Case. Decent Price. But I'm Just Not a Fan of Silicone Cases. 
Better than My Other Silicone Generic. Still Prefer to Use a Bumper Case. 
Fits 4S but really loose 
Inferior to other AmazonBasics case 
A little loose 
I won't purchase again! 
Only O.K.

Nice cover for the price 
MIXED FEELINGS

Fun but no protection 
wrong phone 
Not a case

Not bad value for what it does 
Charges quite well 
requires non-standard charger 
no adapter for iPhone...?! 
Works but very slow 
Terrible output quality at 2.1A 
Be Careful of the Dual Current Outputs! 
Good try. Sprint ruins this phone.

Meh... 
Slight Improvements Needed!!! 
GAVE IT AWAY 
Nice.

Screen works 
Not like the original but ok 
White line on top and side 
Used for 2 years 
Slightly Better Than *Average* Unit...Pairs With Droid 1... 
Plantronics Bluetooth Speakerphone 
I've always loved plantronics but amazon also sells blue ant

Needs a power adapter.

It's OK 
Case 5 stars. Clip 1 star.

Broke quickly. Recommend for non clumsy users! 
Good until you drop your phone 
Nice tight fit but zero protection. 
Snap-on that shows Apple insignia 
Still on the quest for the perfect thin case that still protects the phone

Samsung Headset Review 
Works well while it lasts 
If you didn't get the expected \free headset\ with your recent smart phone purchase these will replace that missing option. 
Good sounding headphones - for a little while. 
highly doubt these are real Samsung product 
missing button 
Exactly like the ones that came with my Samsung Captivate

I used to love this then I started using microfiber towels instead 
?

not too bad 
Advertise wrong 
Decent for a NY winter 
Durable hose nozzle; but not the best ever 
Nothin' To Write Home About........ 
Not as versatile as a conventional adjustable nozzle 
It is OK if you have more money than sense. 
Easier to install than I thought - usefulness still TBD 
No Big Effect 
Fits loosely on my 30x9.5x15 spare 
Fits Mazda CX-5 but I don't like the style 
Great protection a bit small for the money. 
Not Bad

It's OK 
ITs OK

A cosmetic wax not for real protection 
Not Universal 
Great for certain applications. 
needle greaser 
Mixed review 
Leaks around the top 
Get the 7400 instead 
Fast oil changes but pain in but to empty 
The head was too large to work properly 
Does it's job 
Just another way to check tire wear

Too short 
Does The Job - But cheap

It is waterproof but a nightmare to put on. 
Nice concept execution could be better 
Not as helpful as you'd think 
Does not fit all crib types 
Curls up after just a couple of washes 
Eh.

A little warm 
Not as helpful as expected 
Brolly is better 
If you can't beat 'em join 'em! 
it's ok

Too hard to remove even for adults 
No one in your house will ever get to your plugs again 
Works with some cords but pain to install. 
Works well but not exactly baby proof 
Too small 
HUGE covering very bulky 
Ok but enormous easier to just get a power strip with longer cord. 
Not fully baby proof 
Works Bigger Than Expected 
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000046S3W/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3

Good value for the money 
Fun but smells toxic 
doubt i would have bought if seen in person 
A little weak in the legs 
Be prepared to help your baby 
Rear wheels difficult to turn 
huge but baby doesn't like it 
It is huge! 
Baby likes it BUT... 
slopes toward the center

Handy and As Reliable as Anyone Can Expect 
Just OK but it's what we needed... 
Works O.K. but not Wowed! 
Nice for some but no longer necessary 
Super Loud 
Ok... but I replaced with a double pump. 
It's LOUD but gets the job done for OCCASIONAL use! 
Decent gate but annoying door release and very narrow 
Great gate if you're not planning to use extensions. 
I like the crib but........ 
Great for small spaces and travel 
Okay for little babies........ 
Not the best but all there is 
fits fine but so rough &amp; scratchy 
Not as great as I thought it would be 
Toxic smell 
Our daughter prefers the Playtex

I think they fixed the cheap tape problem 
Good if your kid does not peel it off. 
Too short 
Corners fall off 
It works 
It's okay for what I needed it

Liked it but defective 
Just okay 
Great price super-cute just really small 
All Scuffed Up!  :( 
This would be great without the splash guard 
Too Hard 
I Had to Buy a Second One Because My Twins Fought Over the Right to Sit on it 
Cute and shiny 
Good one but didn't work for us. 
Big piece of plastic.

Don't Have this Product but 
Product is fine price is too high 
Functional but not asthetically pleasing 
serves it's purpose but not gentle on baby's skin 
not waterproof 
Serves purpose doesn't hold up well 
Hard to Clean 
Was fantastic until the seam kept splitting causing slow leaks 
Tub has strong plastic smell 
Nice but one design flaw 
Lasted six months 
Great concept but quality is hit or miss 
Not for our daughter 
Better for a baby splash bin than tub 
Good til its Gone 
Not great not bad 
good value 
You get what you pay for 
good support  too harsh 
Good for strollers and swings but not car seats 
Great but better one for less at Target 
Okay but not worth it for the price. 
won't stand up bad twist ties 
Okay but why spend time with twist ties.... 
Beware of third party items 
They're okay 
Nothing spectacular but nice backup 
Do the job but could be improved 
use but 
Thick enough to see under clothes. 
OK but disposables are better 
only ok 
Quite small and retain shape poorly 
Okay 
Great idea in theory... 
Easily saturated and not for mothers who leak lots 
Nice stool but doesn't work for me 
Good but tips easily and is a safety hazard 
Does what it says 
great idea... but execution needs work 
Don't fit 
Maybe this possible solution will help others 
Cool Idea 
Only fits your standard plugs room for improvements. 
Good basic covers 
Not bad but expensive 
love them agree need measuring cup 
Great concept 
Average nail clipper set 
It  works but there's have to be a better one out there!! 
Not Worth It 
Just okay... 
It's ok but may not be needed 
There Are Better There Are Worse 
Built to last but burns the milk! 
It's OK 
Quick and Easy but Pricey 
It's Not Exactly what I expected 
Leaves Wet Bottles 
Not great with other bottle brands... 
Serves the purpose 
Didn't fit my Pottery Barn Dresser with Changing Table Topper 
Nice to have 
Does the trick 
Not as sturdy as I had hoped. Ended up returning it. 
Decent but could be improved 
I thought this would be more useful than it really is 
Was cracked 
Its ok. 
Pretty decent 
It looks awful 
you may love it but its an inconvinience to me 
supports baby great but is Too Large a major inconvienence! 
I'll try it again when my baby is a bit older 
Not good for  young infants 
Has Good and Bad Traits 
Not good for small babies and bathrooms 
Just ok 
This thing is GIANT! 
Just wish it came with padding 
It's ok 
This bath is too big 
Not bad not great 
Semi stay on 
Does not stay stuck 
It doesn't fit 
Not very durable... 
Not the perfect pad 
get the colored ones 
Decent monitor for the price. 
OK as a backup monitor 
Good for what it is if you want something basic. 
Lots of unneeded feedback 
Good under the right circumstances 
Lots of static but it works. 
Not the Greatest 
Ok Quality matches its price 
Sounds Creepy 
Good for the Price 
Nice product but with some cons to pay attention. 
Nice glass bottle terrible nipple 
Does not include plastic storage discs 
Not the best for pumping 
Slower than Slow Flow but just right 
OK but not great 
These nipples worked great for a while 
Less Durable than Other Flow Sizes 
Too fast for my newborn 
Not so slow 
Flow was too fast for my newborn 
So So on the Flow 
Hands free but not as convenient as I thought 
Don't think the foot pedal is a must 
Decent for the price 
Kind of noisey. 
Worked great...  for 9 days 
Pretty Good 
Just Ok 
Good but too easy to shake open 
Love winnie the pooh pacifier clip is just ok! 
wouldn't do it again 
No toddler stool will fit everyone's needs perfectly... 
Works for toilet training but 
Not Tall Enough 
not tall enough 
Smaller Than Expected 
Skids a little bit 
Small and not tall enough 
They leak! 
Baby likes but mommy is disappointed... 
Very Versitile 
Works..sometimes 
Not What I Thought 
Still ended up bottlefeeding. 
Not for me 
OK 
Sizing is wrong 
Works great if the airlines let you use it 
Great idea & functionality but poor quality 
Overrated 
Not for everyday wear 
Meh 
Not a bad product but didn't use as often as expected. 
Works pretty well 
Didn't use 
These work ok but... 
Good but leaks sometimes 
Never Used. 
Easier height adjustment 
ok-depends on the time of the year your baby is born 
Not worth the money 
Pretty good 
They work but not my favorite 
Not so great 
Three Stars 
small 
Baby did not like them 
Baby takes them 
Picky Bottle 
Nice but not perfect for us 
Couldn't use with the nipple it came with 
Good for my older baby 
Air still comes in through nipple 
Decent product probably a little over-priced 
Nowhere near as good as the wide bottles 
Unfortunatelly they leak.. 
Just ok 
Save your money 
Not a great Nipple for my picky breastfed baby 
it`s ok 
Bottles are great.....Nipples not so great 
Great with Slow Flow but doesn't compensate fast enough for Medium or Fast 
nipples are the worst 
Basically does what it is supposed to do. 
Ehhh product 
Like it. 
Replacement valves 
Replacing valves is getting old 
I want to love this! 
Unecessary 
Returned it after I found out it takes 5 minutes to warm a bottle 
Great concept but it needs a little more tweaking! 
Good but you don't need the cooler 
heating times??? 
Not a necessary item but nice for some! 
I thought they looked great but my baby hated em. 
will try the standard playtex ventaire bottle. 
don't care 
these are ok 
Has problems 
Don't expect a miracle 
Too many pieces 
Fine I guess. 
Works but hard to see 
Good and practical. 
Does the job but needs help staying put! 
Beware of Cleaning!!!!! 
OK Product 
Okay price and design but works terrible 
Its perfect but did fall off in 3 days- but not a problem-still good product 
Stayed on for about a month 
Sticks way out and you constantly bump into it 
Of the few options this is the least bad 
Doesn't fit The First Years Breastflow Bottles 
One side fits Medela; Other does NOT fit Born Free 
It's okay. 
Leaks 
never ended up using.... 
Works ok if you can keep them from leaking. Also don't need both kinds. 
It is better than nothing 
Originally liked it but..... 
Get what you paid for 
Good 
Soso 
Looks good on paper 
Average Bottle Warmer 
Save your money 
It's handy but..... 
Ok for the money 
Be Careful 
Not helpful! 
You get what you pay for 
Not fast enough. 
Quick but hot 
Does the job mostly 
Better products out there 
Useful but one problem 
Good - but unpredictable 
Great product if you use it 
Okay product 
Good product idea not very accurate heating 
Works as expected but could be better! 
Well worth the Money but... 
bottle warmer is just OK. Tricky to figure out 
Works pretty good 
Helpful but be careful 
Warms well a little topsy-tervy 
Works well 
Good but too many parts. 
Buy one first to see if you like it. 
Dr. Brown's Was the Runner-Up in Bottle Choice 
I have recommended the bottles to several friends 
These are okay... 
Bought for cereal formula 
item as expected 
Not really a slow flow 
This are okay 
Great pacifier but too addictive 
Its alright 
It's a Baby Bottle Cap...What Do We Expect? 
like it 
OOPS 
So-so 
Does what it says but not very useful if you are frequently opening the door 
There are holes in these cups 
Not sure it made any difference 
Works well as a bath impossible to clean 
Mildew! 
Good Bather with a Few Drawbacks 
Nice but not very soft 
We stopped using this 
Baby Bath Pad 
Good enough 
Nice but don't see how you use it by itself 
Just \okay\ but not great 
An item I didn't end up using much 
decent- but did not find it as great as other reviewers 
We liked it okay 
Returned 
Hands-Free bathing!! 
Not what I expected 
Not preferred by my baby 
Plate okay spoons are great 
weird staining surface 
The spoons are great the plate does not stay put 
It does the job but nothing special 
Too light 
cute but pricey 
Awesome Mibile BUT... 
Great concept faulty execution 
Okay but not sure I'd buy again 
Good for SHORT TERM use only. 
It's not perfect but it works 
Great concept not practical 
Giving this a 3 
Only functional for a while 
My son loves this but was unable to use until about 6 m + 
Spill proof not leak proof. 
These are ok. 
On sale at Target 
Not at all durable 
for small babies only!! 
Not a quick project.... 
Difficult to work with 
Frustrating experience but finally got it to work. Some tips... 
NEEDS MORE ROOM FOR BOTTLES 
Not enough room for bottles 
Adequate for the price 
Adequate for the price 
Good Kit (relatively) - I recommend the 30 piece hospital kit instead. 
gets the job done 
Its okay 
These were 3 prong! 
Not as pictured but still great 
I recommend the 30 piece hospital kit instead. 
Only a couple of useful items - clippers are the best tho'! 
Ok but I would buy in store 
good idea but the avent sippy cups are not good 
True to description but still disappointed. 
Not for the newer glass bottles 
Look for CURRENT ratings - this is NOT the best of 2012 
Good product but expensive and not useful in the long run 
I disagree 
Stinks but nice looking 
Useful with Cloth Diapers But Wished It Held More 
Stinky Stinky Stinky 
Does Not Complete Odor Control. 
Too small for Cloth Diapers 
Doesn't Contain the Smell 
Diaper Dekor Plus 
Disappointed 
Easy but more stinky! 
Not quite as big as needed 
Fine until baby starts eating food... 
Our thoughts after 12 months 
not worth the money 
not so discreet afterall 
WAY too thick 
These work good. 
A little larger please! 
Better than some but not the best 
Not that great 
They do  the job but have some issues 
Work great - before they break 
VERY LOUD! 
Better products available 
big monitor black and white screen 
Start to leak over time 
I love Playtex sippys!!! 
Best Cups Hands Down Need gender selection option 
I like it but... 
I have a love/hate relationship with this Snoogle. 
It Was Only Okay 
Works ok case it comes with is not soft 
Better than no-preggo pillow but not for everyone 
It \was\ great... 
Sometimes Nice Sometimes Not 
Very happy to have it 
Can't say it was terrible 
Comfortable but Awkward 
Needs to have easier way to put on and off pillow case 
Solves some issues would love less loft for head. 
Great at first but neck pain soon followed. 
So many ways to perfect this product! 
Overall a good pregnancy pillow 
Itchy clothings and not soft at all 
Not high quality 
Wife didn't care for this pillow 
good idea for a pillow 
A mind of it's own 
Its alright 
It's OK.... 
Comfortable enough but large 
okay 
Way larger than expected 
Could be better quality and is cumbersome for some. 
Decent product...just not for me. 
Not enough back support 
Adds heat will not move with you 
Better for non-sleeping uses 
Just not for me 
Worked well for pregnancy 
Flattens quickly 
Wash wash wash before using 
They are ok 
They leak 
There's better ones out there. 
flat and not curved 
Comfortable but not invisible 
an ok product 
Absorbent but small 
Ok for around the house 
Meh 
bits of cotton sticks onto your nipples 
saves money but leaves funny lumps bc it's designed flat 
OK 
Not Discreet 
Ok but a bit pricey 
Meh...at least they weren't too expensive 
Not for cloth diapers 
Mostly useful 
OK but impractical for cloth diapers 
an O.K. pump 
Have to try it to see if it works for you! 
Good sound but also has a lot of static. 
Weird fit weird smell but usable 
Bulky and not soft 
Hook and Loop closure and patented flap drive me nuts. 
Not crazy about these 
Thinner than I was expecting 
It works. 
Thanks for a used product 
I really want to give this five stars but.... 
It's just OK 
Good for one baby not for twins 
MUNCHKIN is RIGHT! This tub is SMALL. 
Great idea doesn't work for us. 
Good but Doesn't Last Long 
Cute but small 
It's alright if baby's not too small 
Actual tub is smaller than it looks like 
good for older babies 
Another great product gone downhill. 
Good while it lasted 
Had for about a year and then it sprung a leak 
Fun and functional 
Waste of space 
Not the best pass this one over! 
May or may not work for you - have a back-up 
Great the first time around....not the second.... 
Oh boy do I HATE this pump 
Medela Harmony Lansinoh Avent Isis and Avent Comfort Compared 
If a hand pump is what you want this is pretty good. 
Big Boppy fan but................. 
Not really necessary... 
Baby loves it Mom hates it. 
Good Tub but has Two Major Imperfections 
Waste of Money! 
Great but what toddler fits in this? 
Limited Usage - OK product 
its okay but not the best 
Needs improvements 
love/hate relationship with this tub 
Slip Pads Are Falling Off 
Not that great 
OK bath tub 
Does not work for my baby 
Cheaper at walmart 
Good except for 2 things... 
There has to be a better way 
Not very pleased 
Contents do shift 
more convenient than the whole can but hard to spin the top around. 
Leaky. 
It's not Kiddopotamus but Summer Infant... 
Won't stay unrolled 
Great Concept 
Doesn't take super-human strength to dislodge 
Doesn't work everywhere but doable 
Food mill 
a little work 
KidCo food mill 
Food mill 
There just aren't very many options for locking sliding doors 
Bought & never used 
Warps and stains in dishwasher. 
Don't work as well with Avent Natural Bottles 
room for improvement 
Fun toys not as advertised 
ehhh 
A bit awkward 
Its not a Boppy but it will do 
The sage color is great but it sinks around your waist! 
Just okay for me 
Doesn't work very well as nursing pillow but not bad for a baby cuddler/couch 
On the fence. 
Meh 
Useful but not for nursing 
not bad 
The only bottle my son would take but ... 
Great bottle horrible stage 1 nipple 
Too much trouble 
Not for my newborn 
Just ok 
they are ok 
A lot of $$ for what you get 
Good Idea if your baby took to Swaddling 
Runs very large 
zipper trouble 
Works great no worries about blankets 
Great design but SUPER smelly on my son 
nice but zipper sometimes opens 
Nice but 
Just okay 
You better off buying the bare naked boppy 
Didn't like it 
Nice but not comfortable... 
Don't get them until you know you'll be leaking milk! 
Wicks moisture but doesn't stick worth a darn 
Not a bad pad but not the best either 
Great! While it lasted... 
Gets the job done for really soft foods. 
So-So 
great concept....an ok gadget 
Pretty good 
An Ok food mill 
Not so great 
ok but not great 
Nice but pricey 
Too stiff and smaller than it looks 
Good toy but not worth quite that much money 
Older bigger Boppy tummy play is better 
Waste of Money particularly if you have the Big Boppy 
Eh not excited about it 
Too thin no protection from spit -up & diaper leaks 
Warning: This product shrinks in the wash 
Not as good as we had expected or hoped... 
Good quality mirror but is a bit big & can obstruct view 
Great For Entertaining Baby But Bad For SUV's 
Not such a great buy 
OK but we're on our 4th one! 
2nd time I've gotten a defective mirror... 
great storage container good step stool so so tub side seat 
Don't Think it is a must! 
Okay but there are better... 
It's \OK\ 
Impossible to clean! 
For the Price OK but of Limited Usefulness w/ Torticollis 
Helps for some things but not others 
Too Hot 
It is sort of working for us... 
Make sure it's the right one 
BE CAREFUL!! 
Very tall and bulky- go with Graco Click-Connect instead... 
It's a must have but diffiuclt... 
Convenient but think before buying. 
YOU DON'T NEED THIS! 
Okay as a backup pump 
Its ok 
Perfectly Adequate 
Beautiful but not practical 
Cute but careful... 
Pockets aren't all they're cracked up to be 
frames are nice but... 
Average Car Seat At A High Price... 
We loved it - He hated it 
Not what I expected! 
Too small and synthetic material too HOT for baby! 
Let me clear some things up 
Look at something else 
Ok. 
Like it but i think its not approved for safety... 
Doesn't keep dirt off seats 
Nice and thick but not great for rear facing 
it's OK 
Keeps Slipping 
I like it but...... 
Tinny but fine 
It works 
Sound Sleeper 
Playtex can save you some money! 
Dr. Brown's are better 
Playtex works for us!  Look for set with more variety. 
Tolerable 
Very cute but shrinks! 
TOO BIG 
okay as expected 
Zippers 
Not for us 
Not worth it if baby stands up already 
I wish I'd bought the next size up 
Size is weird 
It's good if you need one. 
Disappointing 
replacement pillows are not worth the cost overall 
Catchy but not needed... 
Nice to have but not necessary 
I wish it made the wipes  more warmer 
Good idea but not all it's cracked up to be 
Sort of gimiky to me 
Indulgent yes... worthless no. 
Mostly use warm water instead 
Works well for non-pop up wipes 
IT'S A GREAT IDEA BUT DON'T GET FROM PRINCE LIONHEART 
Top does not close 
Could Be Improved... 
It's okay 
Doesn't get too warm 
Served it's purpose for about 2 months 
Never used 
harbors mold...sponge doesn't stay moist 
Worked Great for the First 2 Months... 
5 (sorry not 3) stars for something I never thought I'd end up buying 
A Necessity - But I wish there was a better one 
Music too loud 
Ok mat could be better 
Cute but not what I really needed 
NOT THE BEST 
Decent but there are better ones 
Good but not fabulous like I thought 
doesn't help a spitter 
Great for gas but other disappointments 
Mediocre in our experience. 
Great Product - If you like PINK :) 
New style cup is not as good as the old one 
Meh. 
works but has plasticky taste and gets moldy 
Inexpensive - Great Training Cups - Not Spill Proof - Name is Disappointing 
glad that we bought them for summer time and use ... 
before you buy an expensive pump get a $20 manual one first 
good basket; large holes 
Great Value... but itchy!!! 
No more 3 packs... 
Okay 
Not practical for rear facing 
Maybe it will work better for older babies?? 
multi-purpose or not? 
Better when faced forward 
Better when faced forward 
too big for younger babies 
Too awkward for babies 
Good but haven't used 
My daughter just didn't like it. 
teether 
Nicely made but kind of boring 
NOT GREAT NOT BAD 
Fun but.. 
ok teether 
Could be better 
Average teether/toy 
Great concept but... 
Pleasant the eye but hard to grip 
More fun for me than baby 
not the best 
Don't buy for the teether part 
Teether 
OK for the Price 
It was kind of big... 
just ok 
Plastic is pretty hard - not chewy 
More for 6 months and up... 
Warning:  This product shrinks when washed! 
Decent for the cost 
Good toy poor construction. 
ehh not so much 
Fun for a short time but cheaply made 
Doesn't Stick to some Tile 
Static issues 
Didn't like the light! 
Love the concept but don't like the mesh 
Good concept just know what you are getting 
OK but has some issues 
Really torn about this product 
Good idea but makes my son sweaty 
SAFETY CAUTION 
Tedious wrapping 
Not great for my newborn 
Bjorn and Maya Wrap still have more advantages... 
I returned this carrier... 
You gotta have patience 
It's ok- would try something else next time. 
interested to look at 
Really catches baby's attention 
baby enjoys mobile! 
Well I do like Wimmer-Ferguson but this wouldn't fit our crib.... 
Not motorized Only fits cribs with slats/spindles 
Ok Mobile 
visually stimulating 
Cheap materials but good idea 
Yes there are cracks 
Pretty good 
It's cute... 
simple but nice 
A Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Fail-Mobile 
Great patterns but poor execution 
Baby loves it I don't 
Baby became bored quickly 
Limited use difficult to attach works IF it fits 
Better than a High Chair 
It didn't work for my table 
Good seat. Some pros and cons though.. 
Good for what it is 
I'd find a different option. 
Big for my baby 
Easy to transport doesn't fit on all restaurant tables 
Good when it fits on a table 
clip broke after a week on the 1st one 
Good use hard to clean not washable. 
Great idea... but... 
Good for travel not for everyday use 
Ok but doesn't meet my needs 
Inconvenient 
Last Resort Chair 
You might want to know... 
not as pictured 
Not sure how others have hung this on their wall 
Alright I guess but too warm for our baby 
Don't waste your money on a 3 pack 
Not the best quality 
Works Great If You Know How to Use It 
Watch their heads! 
Great but hard to get in/out of 
I did read the instructions but the bottles still leaked... 
Ok to start but this is not all you need 
Not Preferred By Our Baby 
Bottles did not decrease colic in my child 
Decent Plastic Cups 
These didn't work well for my child 
No more spoons! 
Nice Bouncer 
nice but he doesn't like it 
Nice for soothing and relaxation; not play 
Only for newborns 
Just okay 
Problably wouldn't buy again 
Just Okay 
Great seat for newborns... 
This seat is okay probably for little babies... 
DOES NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES 
Boring 
Comfortable but ... 
Doesn't fit Pura Kiki stainless bottle 
Just OK 
Serves its purpose 
A bit too big 
Waste of extra money 
It broke right away 
best tub I've found but shower was useless 
This isn't a bad product but it's not great either... 
NOT FOR LITTLE BABIES!!! 
Love the shower but............ 
tub WITHOUT shower 
Good for up to 3 months 
Not for Newborns 
Eh its OK for a TOP-of-STAIR gate 
Does the job 
A bit too much flex 
Warning: NOT pressure-mounted 
What you need to know before purchase 
wanted more 
To small for my baby 
Good but the tray comes off too easily 
Like it but could use some improvements 
Great chair and height changing option but tray not necessary 
Ok chair.  hit or miss 
Okay - 
Just your average booster 
Okay item. My main complaint is that the tray ... 
Great for travel but just OK for daily at home use 
Good booster but.. 
ok 
Makes a better booster seat 
Happy with product but not so much with condition of product 
Pretty Good Small for a 2 Year Old 
Serves it's purpose.  Good deal for the price. 
Nice seat tray latches from HELL 
It's ok 
Did love it then it started catching my daughters arm. 
Does its job 
WARNING the top doorstop is plastic and can break 
Not the best but will do the trick 
okay 
Just arrived...it's cute! 
Buzz 
Depends on where you live. . . 
Better for a big house 
I like the lights and the sound is fine but some static 
Clear sound but hope you don't loose power! 
ok 
Some static 
Have to try it to see if it works for you! 
Ok Monitor 
Fisher Price Sounds and Lights: Basic No Frills Means to Check on Your Babies 
Stair Guard 
Not pretty but it serves its purpose 
Okay 
Not great looking...but is that why we are buying it?? 
Functionally fine but visually unappealing. 
Functions well but hard to install 
Bad batch of foggy mirrors -- but it can be remedied! 
not very pleased with this mirror 
Good but shifts 
I like the size of it. 
Needs improvement 
Didn't Use These - Flow is too fast 
Either slow or fast???/ 
Great for spare parts for Vintage Baby Bottle Collection 
worked well for a while 
Not god's gift to breastfeeders like i thought it would be.... 
Not a bad toy 
Parts are more fun than the whole toy 
Nice toys 
it's ok 
too small 
Great if your baby will sleep in it 
Great but Too short! 
Didn't really use it that much 
Great product but can be improved 
Good but very large 
Necessary Item? 
Need king size bed to use this

So-so 
Like it but small. 
The design is confusing and the materials reek of plastic but overall not bad 
It does have it's uses 
It's Great 
Not Useful for US 
Good for Very Short Term Use 
I can make better ones myself 
Bunched up after washing 
A little fuzzy 
Not 100% pleased 
2.5 stars -- Not my favorite 
very thin 
Okay product 
Serging seems cheap 
Thin but do the job - good as \tissues\ 
Could be thicker 
They work 
Made in Pakistan! 
Super soft wipes! - Stitching falling apart after first wash : ( 
Feel nice at first but then get scratchy 
a bit on the wimpy side 
Loved them initially 
Didin't work for MY crib but might for other designs 
works well 
Gummi Crib Rail 
Extra Wide 
They work 
Great but needs adjusting 
it's ok 
Poor design 
Buy replacement mesh bags 
Where's the suction? 
Takes too long! 
updated 3/28/06 
Decent system 
good but NOT the air vent!!! 
Too hard to suck 
Wish the shield detached from the connector. 
IT'S ONLY ONE...if you need a pair of them order TWO 
Annoying but necessary 
ended up returning 
Did not work for us! 
Didn't work for us.

Not what i was expecting but the storage is nice 
Good for Booster seats

Would have rated higher except for swing speeds 
Lifesaver! 
Lots of hype okay swing 
Nice swing but has issues 
The mobile broke 
Hinge broke shortly after purchase new hinges on way

hate the canopy 
Not great but okay 
A little big for baby 
A few flaws 
Just okay... 
Not bad 
Like it but don't like the refills 
Great product ... just not for me 
Okay but you need to double wrap diapers once they are eating solids. 
It works 
Works well could be better.... 
I think they'll be better when he's older 
Great transition 
Almost returned it 
WOW. This thing is HUGE! 
Good for only one baby. 
So cute but flimsy 
Not Essential 
Many uses but don't wash well 
Excessive Pilling 
It just drapes over bed 
Not quite 
Wish it would be cheaper 
Good for what it is 
Happy with it

A lot of people can't read instructions 
Good until 9 months 
Decent useful appropriately priced 
Not as sturdy as I hoped 
Sturdy but not the most convenient 
Not good for little monkeys 
Good product with a couple of asterisks 
Flimsy but couldn't find anything better 
Does what it supposed to - mostly 
Works - but flimsy 
Does the job but it's bulky and kind of a pain 
Odd shaped.  Not sturdy.  Difficult to disconnect. 
Not as sturdy as the North States metal play yard 
eh 
Great but hard to set up 
It's okay 
Short window of usefulness - mixed feelings 
Good product but difficult for short parents 
will NOT make a real octagon 
Good idea in theory 
just buy two sets - 
broke 2 pieces 
When it works it's great 
It smells nice that's about it. 
Nice scent but not \natural\ as some describe 
Strong smelling 
just OK. 
Thought it would be better 
Not working good

Looks nice but... 
Good but not great 
Cheap construction smells HIGHLY of chemicals but aesthetically mostly what I wanted 
overall satisfied...for the price 
Paint scratches easily 
Not as pictured!!  Not Graco Brand 
not sure 
Didn't work very well 
Not a Germ-a-phob BUT please...carts are nasty 
Cute but not as safe as I would like it to be... 
Gets in the way 
It is SO loud! 
Better than the alternative...but... 
Seam comments are so true but the rest of the pillow is great 
Love it! 
Great purchase if your prepared to do some minor alterations 
Great at first but flattens over time 
Wonderful pillow! 
useful but with a few tips 
I loved it he hated it 
Not as comfortable as I had hoped 
Great idea but could use improvement 
HUGE Pillow! 
It's okay but as not as great as I expected 
Beautiful Swing But Our Daughter Likes Portable Swing Better 
Great quality but not long enough to be played with.

maybe she will like it later? 
Love the rattle sound - wish it entertained longer 
My baby simply didn't like it 
Pretty toy not that interesting 
Quality toy but my son doesn't like it

Look cute but not very useful 
Looks Cool 
Okay gates 
Ugly cheap and functional...

Worked great....for a week 
It works ok 
Can't stop my little climber 
For the price... 
Hmmm...really think before you buy. 
Serves it purpose 
Not high quality but does the job 
the adhesive doesn't really work 
Tape doesn't stick to foam 
Buy your own aheasive 
Very soft 
The tape is not strong enogh they fall off! 
Nice but not necessary 
Does Not Work for Exceptionally Squirmy Baby 
GREAT for Short Term 
Good concept imperfect execution 
Nice blanket but... 
Great for small babies 
not for big babies 
The small size is to small 
Gives a good tight swaddle but outgrew blanket quickly. 
Okay but big for a newborn 
A step up frm a receiving blanket but out classed 
my baby was small 
Great when you can get it on right. 
it's ok 
Baby won't leave on 
Smaller than expected 
a little too hard 
Easy to clean but not the most comfortable for baby 
too small 
babyjorn bib 
run small 
Comparison to Oxo bib 
great but baby doesn't like it 
Didn't work well with Boon Chair and BLW 
Has good points but doesn't keep my baby clean 
Pretty Good 
Great concept but don't work with highchair for younger tots 
Pockets too high 
Too big for five month old 
Great item little Houdinis can still remove... 
Why is this called a \soft\ bib? 
Good bibs touch in high chair! 
Not ideal 
Not for Smart Babies 
Not as long as the dimensions state 
Just Okay We're not really blown away by it or anything! 
You can do much better for less money 
Something different 
eh 
Hit or miss 
Nice toy but the mirror fell off right after opening it 
My 1-2 year old son couldn't / didn't use it. 
Two pieces cannot be washed; three pieces bulky for small babies 
Good  product 
Just OK 
Just OK 
Not tall enough for a pillow top mattress 
great design and hold cheap material 
Measure your bed (top of boxspring to floor) 
Pretty but with unnecessary features... Needs thicker mattress!!!! 
Great Idea; Not-So-Great Design 
Wouldn't buy again 
Happy but don't use all bells & whistles 
this is nice but very bulky and takes up a lot of space. 
Like height but too wide and wheels don't roll 
Good bassinet but something needs noting 
Adhesive not so great 
Not my favorite 
Not So Good 
Bjorn and Maya Wrap still have their advantages 
Good for a short time 
Easy to Use 
Average 
Spend the extra $ and get a better playmat 
not great but kids will love... 
Decent given limited product options 
Serves its purpose some of the times. 
Good Choice for long term use. 
Great infant seat but not a great toddler seat 
Great for a Newborn 
My baby doesn't like it too much but its ok 
no battery for vibration piece 
Slightly underwhelming 
no warranty? 
Fischer Price Infant to Toddler Rocker 
It's okay 
Not Bad But Not great! 
Nice if only......... 
Despite all the positive reviews we were not impressed 
Good but has is quirks 
Toy Bar Needs Improvement 
cute but basic: a bit on the cheap side 
Like it don't love it 
Not the right fit 
Not safe for infants who are starting to sit up 
Not that great for an infant who wants to play 
Just Okay 
Good for the money 
Okay product; my daughter is not interested in it... 
Not that impressed 
Better for toddlers 
Just Ok 
Ehhh So So 
side shelves a bit flimsy and cushion is useless... 
Bought for the dream on me 3 inch mattress 
Product image does not match product delivered 
Smaller Than Expected but Still Acceptable 
I don't fully trust this 
cute until it came apart then a hazard 
decent product for the price 
Great features on this bouncer 
Nice bouncer but my child can't reach the toys! 
Great to watch for a newborn older kids might get frustrated 
Entertaining 
I Don't Feel This Is A Completely Safe Product 
Straps are TOO Short 
Functional but Not Durable 
Very Entertaining 
Entertaining for babies annoying sound for adults! 
Only So-So 
Some small adjustments would make it better 
Early in the game but ... 
works better when hardware mounted 
it is okay.... 
Leaves a lot to be desired... 
If you need something really supportive look elsewhere 
Not sure yet... 
small 
potty seat 
Just okay. 
It's a potty seat 
A little disappointed 
Works but can scare timid new trainers 
Great fit but not soft 
Tough and scratchy 
thin material 
Don't kill yourself climbing over it! 
Good for reflex - Bad for rolling....Sorta dangerous 
Helps with congestion 
Okay 
It's 2 peices 
Lacks a cover 
Don't love it ... 
Not big incline doesn't fit cradle. 
Works well but has a flaw 
Sound not the music can get irritating 
It works for me 
It's ok 
Not great but they stop the kids from touching the knobs 
Can you say big 
Annoying but keep little hands away from the controls. 
Might be great but check your knobs first! 
This is the only product I've found but it breaks easily. 
Toddler Deterant not Toddler Proof 
Just okay 
Worked great until broke 
Kinda big 
They break 
Small fry and I are unsure. 
Worked great until it broke our door. 
Great Mobile for Price but Music Sucks 
Not bad but for the price you can get something better 
it's okay 
Okay; design could be better and easier to use. 
Milk Mate Storage Containers Better 
Don't get it unless you're using the Avent bottles too 
nice to have it in the diaper bag 
Less fluffy than my old Dr. Brown's brushes. 
Doesn't last long 
Fit plastic and glass differently 
GREAT 
This review more for the bottles in general... 
Not THAT Bad 
Dries the wipes out 
Warm but dries out wipes 
Did Not Help Reduce Spit-Up 
OK for the value 
not what i expected 
Great bottle but HATE the lids! 
Happy with product not color 
Good idea in theory 
I'm going to stick with my non-liner bottles. 
Great for on the go (when washing isnt an option) 
Good Bottle but not great! 
Great design but Amazon sent me three year old bottles. 
Useless measuring 
Good bottle for travel 
Just OK 
Sticking with Playtex non-drop ins ! 
Nice...but one problem 
Good bottles but not very convenient 
Nipple is too slippery when milk gets on the outside 
Extra Parts Extra Work No Benefit 
More to deal with than I like. 
Good but hard to clean and not so durable 
Ugh! The Parts! 
No leaks and lots of options. 
Decent But Not the Best 
Ughhh The leakk! Help 
Works OK 
Pretty good but not the best going. 
drop ins better 
What a hassle to clean 
VentAire standard are preferred by my baby.. 
Like the bottles HATE the nipples 
a few flaws 
It's nice could be better 
Sitting on the Fence 
Good baby swing but too fast for small infants! 
you pay for bells and whistles 
pretty good swing but with some negatives 
A few drawbacks... 
To Fast To Bulky To Loud 
Mixed feelings about this seat 
Good for minor use 
Love and Hate it at the same time 
Easy to use but not comfortable with position 
alright i guess 
Not as powerful as similar priced manual pump 
Great when it works. 
Good but not great 
good- not GREAT 
If you pump more than 2-3x per week get the Swing! 
ok product 
ehh 
Not as good as I'd hoped 
rent from the hospital first 
Maybe it will work... 
Fine for a manual pump I guess? 
Great While it Lasted 
Cheap pump 
Easy to use but hurts! 
electric pumps are better 
Disappointed at the product 
Great Pump But.... That darn o-ring 
Lost Suction Fast! 
Meeh. 
Don't buy unless you're handy! 
Ideal price cheap made 
Cute but hard to assemble 
Okay but issues 
Very difficult to assemble 
Looks nice but missing pieces 
cosmetic damage and questionable hardware 
Cute 
UPDATED REVIEW 
Usable but not entirely user-friendly. 
Good but I've had better! 
They look funny but do the job 
Cool looking but flimsy 
I always get the crappy red one 
It works 
Works But \Eh\ 
OKay 
not sure how much it will hold? 
Good enough 
Huge Hooks - Used Command Strips Instead 
Eh. It's just ok 
Bath Toy Hammock Havoc 
Baby loves it but doesn't clean so well 
Go for the shade 
Not bad 
Okay  toy 
not the best but it works 
Not very universal. 
I saved my kid from falling in the toliet with this 
Good butt... 
What a  pity!!! 
Overall a decent purchase 
Good product but ripped 
changing pad cover 
not needed 
good quality 
Soft but thin 
The color is a brighter green than in the picture 
Ok but you can get better at Target 
Nice for a newborn. 
Soft but not durable 
Nice and soft 
Good product not great color 
Does the job but a bit overpriced. 
Right one 
It Works 
Raises to the right height but not very stable 
Higher but not so sturdy 
Shaky addition and not worth the $ 
Perfect height 
Ok 
They will work 
It was ok 
Somewhat diasappointed 
Good but overpriced 
Good product but would probably buy larger containers. 
Lids are not tight - not dishwasher safe 
Yep - their Ice cube trays... 
Well made however difficult to get the cubes out of compared to regular ice cube trays. 
Good idea but a little bit of a hassle 
Better than an ice cube tray! 
Great and easy to use 
Eh not impressed 
did i pay for an ice tray with lids? 
They do their job. 
Great idea just a little hard to get the milk out of the tray 
Like it but... 
Just okay. 
maybe fine for baby food but not good for breastmilk 
Not the bet 
the case freezes too! 
Hard to get out 
Lids will not fit 
Expensive ice cube trays 
Does the job nothing special. 
Don't forget 
Needs modifications 
Good idea with a few flaws 
Very difficult to attach to Combi Twin Sport Stroller! 
Good shade clumsy attachment 
not a very bad buy 
It is okay. 
I just hope it looks better after the first year 
Now what am I going to do with it? 
Good for car trips 
Would Have to Pass 
Great for carrying the car seat 
Wish the stroller was a little more shock absorbent 
Use it all the time but wish I had bought a different one! 
Good for traveling 
Not bad but there is a better option... 
Good for the price 
Looks nice with the rest of the set but a lot of $ for such a basic design 
Took a few tries but now is keeping time 
NO. Wish I would have known. 
Our second summer monitor. 
Good monitor 
If You Don't Mind Static and Peeping Toms It's Cool. 
Won't buy again for second baby 
Ask your neighbors which monitor they have first... 
Decent monitor which saved my sanity the 1st year! 
Good product needs more features 
Static is a problem 
Tons of static and analog is not private 
not sure about it yet 
Still Stinks 
Super strong scent 
Smell is a little intense 
Way too small 
not so good product...good seller 
Doesn't contain serious stink 
Regular polythene with added fragrance 
SMALL 
Strong scent 
good for home 
Poor Material 
For Newborns ONLY and very thin 
Simple to use but maybe too simple for effective swaddling 
Just OK - motor is loud and it doesn't stay on long enough 
Fun but loud 
It's grown on me 
After FIVE years of use... 
Great chair 
This seems like a decent cover with some small issues. 
fraudulent image 
Doesn't stay put very well 
not for intended use 
okay 
Does the job 
Good for catching milk but wears easily in the wash 
Great bibs but 1/3 the price at TRU 
Good bib velcro sucks! 
The directions say you have to caulk this elephant on ... 
Cute 
Sturdy and cute but modifications may be needed 
cute idea it didn't fit our tub 
Meh 
Cute/Doesn't fit 
Super cute when it stays on the faucet. 
Elephant spout

Serve purpose put easy to take out 
I'd prefer it was opaque.

Decent for the price 
Alright 
They work!! Maybe too good 
Frosted plastic kind of cheap looking. 
good 
Very hard to get out from outlets 
Works well 
Does it's job not easy to install 
Hard to keep things plugged in 
Meh 
Smaller than most covers 
Babyproofed the house....and also parentproofed it. 
Screw hole is in the center 
It's okay 
Very Small 
Average 
Car shade only ok 
Basic shade easy to install 
Good idea but far from perfect 
Okay 
keeps seats cleaner 
Airy great for boat and small areas very short \leash\ line. Good color 
good 
Good idea but not the product 
Annoyed by the packaging 
Needs higher splash guard 
Not necessarily the best for a boy 
Too small for big kids & moves 
bit small but comfy 
Great! 
Ok product 
Lid doesn't open very far 
Okay for the job but foot pedal is the issue here 
It's an OK diaper Pail 
Do Not Buy If You Have A Dog

Not the best 
No smell from it 
Decent cheap pail 
Not good for wood floors or normal sized feet 
Meh. 
Smaller than expected 
small okay diaper pail 
Okay 
Nice but small 
Stylish but not as durable as we had expected 
Son loves it 
Cute but gets jammed 
Was great until... 
The breastsheilds are attached! 
As expected 
I love them baby doesn't! 
Good reusable cover 
Nice for the price.. spring for the Thirsties. 
ehh ok 
Not my favorites 
Maybe For younger babies? 
didn't help my son's eczema 
papery not the best. 
works but not soft 
They sent me the LARGE toddler liners not the BABY liners in the description! 
They work but are scratchy and I can't flush them. 
Used to be better 
It worked but we no longer use it. 
Do the job but don't seem comfy on the tushy 
Sometimes Smells 
Used to really like this stroller 
Ok for baby bottles only 
soft 
Looks better than it actually is 
This brush is just ok 
Dirty nipples... 
good idea but not what i was going for 
Ok 
Not as sturdy 
These work and are great - the sticker left behind is permanent 
they work great until.... 
Tricky to Use but effective 
works well enough 
Works well but doesn't last 
Screws broke off in cabinet 
Easy to install but didn't last long 
great idea but hard to clean! 
Difficult to open 
Fresh food feeder Eh ~ so so 
Hard to get the lid off 
Great for on-the-go formula 
Good for travelling but.... 
Lid won't stay closed - cracked container 
Too many pieces. Not a soft mouth piece. Might be spill proof but not worth the trouble 
ok cup 
Need color choices 
Baby isn't quite ready for these... 
They're just okay... 
These are okay 
Pretty Basic 
meh. 
Really hard to get liquid out but I guess they don't leak... 
Hard to drink out of 
not spill proof 
leaky 
At least they don't leak... 
Great Product  - but colors vary 
Perfectly decent sippy cup 
Not impressed but it works okay 
pleasant cleanser; poor brush 
Fine toothpast toothbrush needs work 
Not my favorite toothbrush but is ok 
Just Another Toothpaste 
Too fast for my little one 
Nice bottle nipple but very leaky 
Doesn't fit well on all toilets 
Does the job for the price 
super cute but your taking a chance on colors .. 
Waste of Money 
Snack Trap? 
Cute but not functional after a few uses 
great idea and design but less than it used to be 
Buy Snack Catchers instead! 
Terrible on the back but baby loves facing out 
Good for small baby but then hurts shoulders a lot. 
A Mixed Bag 
Better than \Original\ but not by much... 
hurts my back 
It's a good carrier but it kills my back! 
Great product but faded too quickly 
Great...if you have a strong core 
Poor weight distribution 
Won't be using a Bjorn again 
Works well -- kid can get hot 
could only hold our daughter for a very short period of her development 
Baby Bjorn (mama here) 
Not good for babies over 15 lbs and/or 26 inches 
Have a love/hate with this 
Hurts husband's back after awhile 
easy to use but poor support for mom's back and baby's hips 
Not in love 
Easiest carrier to put on and to get baby into but the least comfortable 
If You're Large-Chested Find Something Else 
Kills your back 
alternative to baby bjorn 
It Works 
Don't buy it until/unless you really need it... 
helpful but gets uncomfortable 
Quick and easy to use but kills your back! 
Did not securely fit into gate 
Not as soft as says 
A little rough 
Video Review 
Runs small but good quality and effective.. IF your baby is still tiny. 
LO didn't like it. 
great product but easier for baby to \break out\ 
Came loose 
Not as good as Halo 
Disappointed in the Velcro 
Ok Swaddler 
Large size seems hazardous for strong boy with will to turn over 
Good product but probably won't use large size 
Not the same as the infant 
Does not work with Chicco car seat 
Much thinner than I expected 
does the trick but not a great fit for the snugride 35 
Serves the purpose 
JJ Cole Urban Bundleme Stealth 
good but too small 
Blanket is great but I had to air it out for days 
description is wrong 
Good bottle bag 
Bottles don't fit nicely with tops 
Could be bigger 
Just ok 
Bigger than I thought 
I love these cups but....... 
good but not the best 
Cute but not the best. 
The sling + bump don't work together 
Okay 
Nice tub for newborns 
Works great but... 
Great for newborns not so great for the in-between stage! 
Seems a bit small... 
Loved the sling hated the tub. 
Good for newborns 
Useful for small baby but risky to use. 
An ok tub 
Hard to clean 
eh. 
Nice but not big enough 
Difficult to install 
too fast for \slow flow\ 
Flow not consistent 
Not as good as the clear \slow\ ones. 
work well but smell terrible. 
Does what it is supposed to do. Changed milk. 
Work Okay 
Harder to thaw than bags 
Not for giant toddlers/preschoolers with tantrums 
LOVE the stroller but it is very large. 
Wanted to love it 
Loved for a little bit... now unwieldily... 
Best of an ok bunch....? 
Good for the price 
Good for the Price

Great 
Better for older babies 
I should have just used what I had 
Just okay 
Good for baby food but a little quirky! 
Not as good as they used to be 
Not what I ordered 
You get what you pay for 
I cut a hole out of the side 
OK As a Pet Barrier 
Nice but don't wear well 
Not amazing but still convenient 
great chair though weight limit more like 28lbs 
Should have listened 
works great with one major flaw... 
Good price for this product 
didn't fit my pump 
Product quality and value as expected but size options did not work for me. 
Not significantly different from 24mm 
Large size helped 
hole not small enough shield too small 
Medela Small Breastshields 
ok 
Can't tell the difference 
Not what I was  expecting 
These work well 
Channel is wider but legnth is longer 
These are okay 
wrong size 
Smallest size? 
Not much different 
Slightly More Comfortable But Warped After A While... 
Not really worth it for me but maybe good for you? 
Good volume but ow! 
I Have A Love/Hate Relationship With These Suckers 
Nothing special 
Necessary part ok price hard to wash 
These work but make sure to buy the yellow membrane too! 
Questionabe 
The product is as promised but I don't find it useful. 
Great idea 
the wipes are individually packed! 
Baby got bored with it 
Great concept but super wobbling for our elongated toliet 
Sounds like a great idea but a bit instable for a beginner 
For your smaller child 
2 different reviews you need to see. 
Good for a year then unrecoverable 
Didn't stick to our \slick\ bath tiles 
Great until it falls off the wall 
Very cute functional when it stays up 
Fell off the wall 
Great for kids falls off the wall (especially when it's the middle of the night so you think your home is being robbed...) 
Super cute but falls off instantly 
Super Cute BUT... 
Like it but hate it..... 
Cute but not worth the price. 
Just okay 
Good as a Back-Up 
you dont use everthing that comes in there 
REPLACED DECATHLON WITH THE BOULEVARD 
My baby doesn't like it'll much 
I may have purchased this too late 
Wanted to love it only liked it. 
Large heavy and cluncky 
Not ideal for tall/long babies 
Ok 
The feature I like is that you can put the toys hanger in the crib 
Mixed Feelings--Monkeying in the Middle 
Cute but flimsy 
Just don't use them in the water! 
Cute but not as expected 
Okay but not fab. 
Can this bath toy make your child sick? 
Cheap and simple... 
baby like bumpkins better 
I like it better than my baby does.... 
Easy for Baby to Remove 
Not for liquid feedings 
Tough Pelican 
Easily removed by baby 
I like it but my babies don't.

My baby hates this 
Great for catching crumbs and drips but not very comfy for baby 
My son hated it 
Pocket is great hate the neck-piece 
It's okay 
Not as thick as I hoped 
OK 
Good idea but needs minor improvements 
Loved the concept my baby hated it 
Good product but not for me 
Very small 
It is a OK bath toy 
overall pleased but couple of complaints 
Ok for travel 
Haven't used it quite as much as we expected... 
takes too long 
Bassinets Disappointed But Playard is Great 
Bassinets are not good! 
Don't plan on your babies actually sleeping in this! 
There are better products out there.... 
Just ok 
Fine carseat 
nice for saving space but not great otherwise 
Doesn't work well with Chicco travel system stroller 
Not the best baby item but couldn't find anything better 
Be careful its packaged spring loaded 
functional 
Love it because its so easy but the wheels keep falling off! 
You get what you pay for 
It's OK... nothing spectacular 
Eh not that great. 
Leaks 
Cute. 
cute but doesn't soothe 
Adorable! But say bye bye to your battery budget 
My son loves it...a little too much for sleeping 
Very cute wish that the stars moved or flickered 
Item not as pictured 
Lights are pretty but doesnt help my child go back to sleep.. 
It's okay 
I think this might have been used! 
A little over-priced for what you get 
Nice idea but could be better 
Okay but a little disappointing. 
Entertaining but depends on the purpose. 
pretty but not much of a night light. 
I like it and I don't. . . . 
Very cool but a bit expensive 
It's Okay...Wasn't what I expected 
Interesting product good when all the lights are off. Some kids might not like it. 
good nightlight 
Not as great ! 
My child outgrew it very quickly 
These sure have changed. 
Would of been great if it fit.

Decent 
Not the color I was expecting 
OK for the price... 
Nice & soft but the seam runs on the bed instead of the side 
gorgeous color not-so-decent fit 
Color a little off 
stained in the wash 
Very thin 
Seams came undone and needed bolstering 
GRAY Crib Sheet 
Fits Well but Not So Soft 
Fits a standard mattress 
Cute But A Bit Too Snug 
Looks Great 
Cute pattern not the softest. 
Cute print but scratchy 
It's ok 
NOT Golden Yellow 
Cute Pattern But Rough 
TOO SMALL 
Very hard to assembled so far very spill proof. Still prefer older design. 
Good but separates 
Baby needs to Bite/Squeeze straw to drink 
great straw cup  but breaks super easily 
Hardware insufficient and locking mechanism has issues 
OK 
This was useful int he winter 
Too hot for a baby? 
Very soft and luxurious feeling 
Just an OK swaddle Miracle Blanket better. 
Not great for swaddling 
Too warm 
velcro problems 
Its okay 
Too thick 
Too hot / cannot remove swaddle 
Just Average 
good in a pinch but can scald baby's milk 
Okay - I'm probably spoiled. 
Not for nonraising headrests 
Don't open your rear windows. 
eh 
Need to make sure it is secure 
Ok for when they're infants useless with toddlers 
Does the job. 
Doesn't work well with middle of backseat that has no head rest 
HARD 
Very hard 
keep an eye on these. 
Fun cup for kids but leaks easily 
Good price but not very safe 
Not as good... 
dont use them as much as i thought i would... 
Not so great 
Nice design but sharp edges 
Not for babies 
Beautiful blocks but they splinter 
Served us well but I wouldn't buy it again 
Fairly disappointed... 
It's okay 
Nice and portable - better than nothing. 
Very portable but not suitable for training boys 
Don't use it much 
I like the idea of this potty 
Better in theory 
First Impressions and a Test Drive 
nice folding potty for little ones 
Pinches! 
Not perfect 
Not as great as I had hoped 
Nice tub but not great for newborn. 
Great for people who already have a basin 
Read the fine print! 
Not quite as well designed as the Primo Eurobath 
Comparison of 4 baby tubs. 
Mixed Review of this potty 
Simple and nice. 
Not using because too soft/thick 
Not a proper fitting item for the GRACO 36&#34; square playyard 
A little Big 
The product you need for your symphony rental 
Mixed feeling about this product: milk does back up in the tubing 
Good in a pinch but SLLLOW 
Worked well while it worked 
Great concept but.... 
Fine wipes - just not needed 
Great idea but... 
Good for on the go 
soapy 
Ok 
Convenient but pricey 
Small than individually wrapped wipes 
too wet and expensive 
Expensive but work well 
Ok But Not Great 
It works... 
Look at your doors before buying! 
It's a little awkward... 
Didn't work for me 
It's a mini toilet seat 
Careful-suffocation hazard 
Good bib but it causes scratches! 
Careful about Shrinking 
Wish I'd spent a little more for better bibs 
OK

Quantity over quality

Too big for a 5 month old 
i like it 
Not really waterproof. 
Velcro eventually wears out 
Not So Good 
Sturdy stacking cups/buckets but.... 
Good idea poor quality. 
Great idea stiff plunger 
Ordered red received pink. 
Cute but find it too narrow 
Too small 
Stains 
okay 
Huge bowl on this spoon 
Could easily use a bib and achieve the same thing 
Not bad 
Not so useful... 
unessary 
Fine if you want it to look \built in\ 
Less laundry 
Useful but not perfect. 
Good concept poor execution 
Too short 
Not very durable 
Rips even with cover 
Works... 
Okay could be tougher 
Not as good as I thought it would be... 
Disappointing. 
Not for a newborn 
Pretty but not great for baby wearing. 
Small rings creates too much friction 
not comfortable 
Simple compact carrier 
love this sling except the rings. 
Works OK 
Eh hard on my back 
help! 
A bit snug for our Maxi Cosi Mico 
unfortunately a necessity... 
Does the job. 
Small 
pretty decent product but needs improvement 
Just Okay 
Not our most long-lived toy 
It's a good idea but it stays really cold 
Fun but leaks :( 
Cute but received damaged package 
Beware of the teething baby!! 
Ehhhh 
Love the concept but not really that functionable 
Cool idea 
Took a chance...Didn't go well... 
No good as mirror... 
Too large for standard bottles 
Good for cleaning but very stiff! 
Decent But Not Durable

Eh not bad but not great 
Does Not Fit Dr. Browns Bottles 
Cleans Your Bottles 
Good value works as well as the more expensive brushes 
A Pain for Standard Bottles 
ok but sprays everywhere! 
Must be hard to make a good bottle brush 
can't clean the bottom of the bottle 
My Pet Gate 
Okay 
Must have but the price is nuts 
Necessary but could be much better! 
A necessary but not great addition to your Duallie 
So so...

Okay but not too great 
Not Enough Support. Possibly Uncomfortable.

Loose fitting 
Good protection for carseat still tiring to lug around airport

Very thick and too big - not for newborns 
pacifiers for recent born 
Its okay 
pricey 
Good for keeping things organized 
Good enough 
Cool look small size 
Just OK 
If only it were larger 
Not bad could be better. 
Manly but lacks essential space 
it's a very good neutral diaper bag that I can share with my ... 
Hard to use 
Mehh 
Just ok 
Nice 
Great Diaper Bag...JUST SMALL! 
good product 
would love it if it didn't tie to fasten 
good not great 
Fits weird 
too big for baby 
Too big for infants 
Concept and size is good 
Good product but... 
This neck has velcro not ties 
Fit fine but baby found it uncomfortable 
The bibs we got do not match the description 
oh 
Too bulky for a 2 year-old 
Cute. 
I agree not the best for boys. 
It Works Fine But... 
Good 
Enjoyable enough 
Keeps toddler centered 
Worked great at first 
Okay 
Long Leacho 
So-so 
Loved and found invaluable but has a couple major design flaws. 
Helps me sleep like a little baby! 
Zipper broke but company handled it well 
Just okay... 
Not enough pocket room to put diapers and wipes in. 
good diaper changing pad but flimsy baby wipe case 
Great design with so so construction 
Great bag BUT the red dye leaking is a problem 
Bulky comfy and works 
ehhh 
needs more padding 
Doesn't fit Target or Costco carts 
Comfy but... 
fits omly certain carts! 
okay 
toliet cover 
It seemed like a good idea... 
Kids will fall in...be careful 
Bulky but sturdy 
Nice soft seat but slides around a bit. 
Works well....sometimes. 
Love how it folds No peepee guard not very stable 
So far so good.. I suppose. 
If you want a rear-facing seat for a long time go with the Marathon 
OK Gate..... 
Seat is made for sitting not walking. 
Quality ok but not great 
Typical disposable furniture 
Not as good as the Stork Craft Crib 
Not great quality but okay for price 
hard to assemble drawers don't line up 
Not bad 
Okay for the money but had to exchange a drawer. 
So-so Product 
Work fine but these are way to big for the Babino Mio bucket 
Does the job 
it was ok 
So messy and really not great for hands 
It may be me 
This was not as simple and easy as the kit would have you believe...although not all of that has to do with the kit itself 
Just OK 
not so sure 
Not practical 
Meh. 
more aesthetic than anything else 
Baby enjoys it but Mama sees room for improvement 
Kept collapsing 
Could be better if there was something that moved 
Tad overpriced for what you get. 
Sometimes it tips over! 
Very nice but overwhelming. 
Sound wiring is defective 
OK but not great 
There are better playmats out there. 
Is this real or fake 
Not essential 
Stopped working after a month 
Worked well only for a little while 
Beware of getting a set with music function that just dont work! 
I guess I'm happy if he's happy. 
Not that great 
Good basic umbrella stroller with no thrills 
good overall but some usage challenges 
It's a decent upgraded umbrella stroller but I kick the wheels when walking... 
Love/hate 
Not Bad Not Great No reason to buy 
A saver in an airport setting 
Nice stroller 
An OK Stroller 
Cute but so tiny; it should cost half what it does. 
Okay. 
Okay 
great kit but low quality 
Amount differs from description 
Great deal overall but cups are not safe for biters 
Three Stars 
Thought they would be better than they actually were 
It's only ok 
Not easy to use 
Be careful. 
save your $ and use a qtip 
nothing special 
Okay Clipper for Toddler 
Sharp blade but a bit small to hold 
Its a hard plastic 
Its ok 
Not impressed 
Rattle for 7 month old 
too easy to wear out it seems 
You'll likely not use everything in it... 
Effective but can get moldy 
Doesn't stay on doesn't catch crumbs but washable 
cute and easy to wash 
HARD TO ASSEMBLE 
scratches easily 
SOOOO Hard to put together! 
Nice but oh the SCRATCHES (and poor customer service from manufacturer) 
Beware of mattress issues! 
Good not great 
Nice quality but I would suggest purchasing in store 
expensive bulky 
Pretty Crib But..... 
Beautiful Bed Crummy Design 
Rocks too forcefully 
DaVinci  Alpha Mini Rocking Crib - Cherry 
Fit Form and Function 
Great looking but lightweight drawer construction 
Not safe for a climbing toddler 
Crib and matching Emily mattress not a perfect fit! 
Very Easy to Scratch/Dent Wood 
You get what you pay for 
One flaw 
4 Months Post Partum... 
Agree with all pros however...there's a hidden con! 
Leg and Arm Trap for Baby 
Decent changing table with one substandard design element 
Fine and functional 
Cute fun for a short period of time 
Never installed this. 
Pretty good teether but quality control issues 
is good for younger baby only 
OK But Edgy 
Very big- but my sons feet go in and out- not so great. 
No miracle sadly 
Don't know! 
Not easy to use 
Not worth the $$$ 
Works but a little complicated 
Not a miracle for us. 
Superior to other swaddling devices inferior to the double swaddle 
Nice but doesn't last long 
It's ok. 
Pull it tight 
We did not like the design of this for our baby 
Frustrating to use if you have a wiggly baby 
Hard for me to use it 
Good for a newborn not as good after a few months 
May work great for some 
Great now bad later! 
I'm sure it works for some; but not me. 
Works Okay 
Didn't work for my 2 month old who doesn't like to be swaddled...plus a bit overpriced. 
Too much fabric 
Great but he could wiggle out of it 
No Go 
Good... if you need it. 
Does the job 
Could use some improvements 
Works half the time 
My baby was too big already... 
Good but not a Miracle! Still short for long babies! 
Needs to be longer 
Didn't work for my kid 
Eh.  Just ok. 
Failed to see the miracle 
its ok but not for cold places 
not as soft as I hoped for 
Bigger that I though 
Not a replacement for Lenny the lovey 
Why don't you like this baby!? 
Not her favorite but it is soft. 
baby is not interested 
Mom love Dad not so much... 
I like it baby doesn't 
Do the research first! 
Okay but definitely not great. 
okay for girls but worthless for boys.. 
okay 
Nice tub but thermometer broke early on. 
Useless until I figured it out 
Decent Gate ok quality 
4-sides = peace of mind 
Nice but get a cover for it 
Get the right cover! 
It will work 
Poor quality 
Ok 
Only Partially Successful. 
Bubble dispenser is a joke 
Is your shower pull knob far back on the spout? 
It Okay. 
Doesn't fit all faucets 
Just FYI 
BABY DOESN'T SEEM TOO INTERESTED IN THESE 
Cute but a little concerning 
Funny but not effective 
Cute but baby doesn't like it 
Pricey for what you get. 
Just okay -- not especially great and somewhat overpriced 
Only ok 
Halfway there. 50% achievement on both the scrapbooking/picture pages and milestone pages. 
Meh. 
Good warm hat. 
OK 
Cute but oddly tall 
Very tiny! 
Runs Small

Sizing Issues 
No way is the 0-6 months 
cute but tight 
Beautiful hat but VERY small.... 
Runs small... 
Too small 
Items are too heavy

Handy for extra storage 
Decent 
Not sturdy. 
Could Use some adjustments 
Adhesive not very strong 
OK 
not that good for puree 
Ok baby food grinder 
Great but i ended up not useing it much 
Okay for some foods 
Lids come off a little too easily 
Too easy for a one year old to open when he doesn't understand the purpose of the cup 
Good when they understand. 
eh. could be better. 
Good idea could be better 
Just okay 
Ok munchkin monster is better 
Neat idea but still doesnt work great 
decent but not for me 
Great concept... 
Not as good as I hoped 
It's okay. 
good 
Good handles lousy lid. 
Flimsy 
OK but not as great as I was hoping 
Doesn't really catch snacks... 
Good idea. Kid figured out a way to spill it all 
spend the money! 
Not quite what I expected 
Nice Idea 
Nice one 
Doesn't really keep them in 
Love the product - needs improvements 
Might lose more food than you get.. 
Great if your baby is ready for it 
Clever Idea But Still Makes a Mess 
Good could be better (with accessories) 
Not spill-proof but the handles are great 
Maybe a catcher but not a keeper 
Good idea hard to get snacks out 
no real way to contain the mess this helps 
okay 
Our boy rips it open with his teeth -- not really useful 
Love the colors 
Upside down turtles? 
Cute but not worth it 
Water Traps 
I liked it 
crib light 
Munchkin Voice Activated Crib Light 
It's alright 
Munchkin products overpriced on Amazon 
Munchkin Deluxe Baby Food Organizer 
Great organizer 
Definitely a space saver but definitely has drawbacks 
A little disappointed 
Works ok for small baby food jars 
organizer 
OK but not very sturdy 
Cheap but functional 
Soapy water gets caught trapped in weird plastic \pockets\ 
I don't hate it but I don't love it either 
Pretty good seat 
Big but adorable and effective 
Does Not Stay Closed 
It is worth the buy 
Meh. 
Cute bag kit is OK 
Didn't really work for us

its toothpaste 
LO loves the toothbrush 
&#50500;&#51649; &#50504;&#50024;&#48420;&#51648;&#47564; 
Good luck sticking yur finger in a baby's mouth 
Great except for one big issue... 
Did not work for my baby. 
oily initially. and a bit slow 
It's ok 
I love this type of bottle but I prefer the larger nipple 
ok 
Different from description 
Spill proof cup 
spill proof drinking proof 
Price 
Nasty toothpaste 
Works ok 
Granted I don't want my 1 year old in the toilet but I would like it if my adult friends could figure it out 
Great idea - but confusing 
Ok product 
Ehh 
Good for toddler 
Works better for some toilets than others 
Does the trick 
They're doing what they need to do. 
Works a little too well 
great helper 
Okay solution 
works for now... 
Still leaves some room to open. 
A little awkward. 
Better than nothing for now 
Put a trash bag in the refill carton 
Average. 
DIsappointing 
Major pros & major cons 
still smell small odor 
We have a love/hate relationship 
broke after 6 months 
great idea and works for awhile 
Pain to install but they do the job. 
Broke within days...probably good for under 12-14 month olds 
Difficult to install 
Child proof...and maybe adult proof. 
Worked for about a week 
It's been doing it's job for 3 months now 
Works well but too easy to break 
Not easy to assemble but very cute 
LOVE & Hate! 
Cute but poor quality control and customer service 
Adorable Horse Terrible Assembly 
Nice rocking horse bad smell bad polyurethane job 
Stairway Gate? 
A must have for Ameda pumps

Poor quality but replaced at no charge 
Great mattress for the first year 
Hard as a rock 
Gift when I purchased a davinci crib. 
Looks nice but is made of cheap materials 
incomplete product 
a little small 
Overpriced 
Works as advertised just not helpful for me 
Not Bad 
Great ... For about a month 
This is a great swaddling blanket but.... 
Good gate but... 
Not sire how duable this is 
okay but need another product to hold on 
Not the full coverage we needed 
Stick with regular Bumkins bibs 
Good for younger babies 
I don't see they are helpful... 
Great idea but bad quality velcro. 
Pockets work but could be longer 
Like them but .... 
Not my favorite 
They do the job but aren't worth the price. 
Good for feeding - NOT for drooling! 
Waterproof bibs 
I prefer Baby Bjorn 
really thin 
Cute but not meant for skinny babies 
Not for young infants 
Very thin but cute design! 
didn't work out as well as I had hoped 
Good for traveling; retains some odor 
Do the job but the best 
3rd or 4th set because it gets stinky 
Great until it was smelly... 
Not for babies who love to explore 
I really wanted to love these but they didn't stay on 
Cute but unsure about safety 
Cute but not a winner in my house. 
I was rather excited for my baby to use these ... 
Great concept hard to clean 
Difficult to clean 
Nice but not very useful for us 
Good idea but hard to open 
Ok Product 
too risky 
my baby did not like it. 
It's a nice concept but a pain to keep clean 
Great idea but very difficult to clean 
Great concept but there are better versions 
Not interested. 
great for baby a pain in the rear to clean! 
Mixed Feelings. 
Three Stars 
Child: loves Mom: not so much! 
Okay 
Hard to Clean 
Your baby may love it or may not be interested 
Love the concept tricky to clean 
Hard to Clean 
Great (in theory) : But Didn't Use Much 
Wasn't worth the purchase 
Probably best for brand new tasters 
On the fence about this... 
love it but HARD to open 
Good in theory 
hard to clean 
Decent concept 
Entertaining but not safe 
Not Effective 
He likes it!..but is it doing anything? 
not bad 
Baby loves to chew on it but I wish the handle were much larger 
This thing seems more like a teether than toothbrush 
Good chew toy but not toothbrush. 
Great Soothing Teether as well 
Pretty Good Okay. 
Baby kind of likes it not sure if it cleans teeth. 
More of a teether than a toothbrush 
7-month-old likes it 
Could be dangerous 
little awkward to use 
Too soft 
too big and awkward 
The travel one is better 
I guess I'm alone in thinking this but... 
It's okay but not as nice as I hoped. 
Not sure if the baby likes it but I do! 
Sound box doesn't fit--which ripped it 
Not that great but does function 
only 4 sounds 
its ok 
Great product except for major design flaw 
cloud b sleep sheep 
Just buy a white noise machine 
wanted to love it wish it stayed on 
falling apart after &lt; 6 months 
It's okay... but I wish it didn't shut off automatically 
Needs continuous play mode sheep muffles sound 
Good idea better options out there 
I really wanted to love this. 
Too quiet 
Cute not so practical 
Doesn't seem to make a huge difference 
Not what I expected. 
Replaced with continuous play machine 
Cloud B Sleep Sheep 
Cute stuffed animal but not the best sound machine 
Okay but not great 
Limited to 45 minutes - useless for night time 
Cute but it's usefulness is limited. 
My baby doesn't care 
Great noise poor quaity 
Didn't Fool My Baby 
Ok product 
For my wife 
Its okay 
Clingy - not worth it. 
Good but expensive product 
Bebe au Lait 
Warm 
shrunk half its size! 
Not for everyone... 
didn't really work for me although I still recommend it 
Perfect for small infants but not older babies 
Not worth the $.  Might buy a cheap eBay China one and add wire to the top if needed. 
Not as good as I though it would be 
Nice one 
peekaboo !!!! 
Great idea but tough to use with an active baby! 
Doesn't Impress Me 
Not worth the money 
Too warm 
Good quality but thick cover has its down sides 
Not as useful as I thought it would be 
Pretty But... 
Pretty But Can't Quite Get it to Work 
Waaay too big 
Bibs 
Too big for baby! 
Utilitarian but not strong 
OK 
Great toy not so great thermometer. 
Just a toy 
Cute stay-clean little duckie - useless as a temperature checker 
As ducks go it's great. 
Cute Duck Poor Thermometer 
Its fine for the price. 
Eh it's ok 
Cute but Hard to Read 
Packaging 
Average 
its ok 
Bad thermometer 
Cute Toy 
It's cute but not an accurate gauge of water temperature 
Purchased for 10 month old 
It's a nice seat for skinny babies! 
Just ok 
Not in love with this... 
Not for chubby babies 
Hate the buckle!  Squeezes too tight! 
decent seat 
Daughters legs too chunky 
Useless really... 
It's just OK 
Loved it for when he needed a bit of help sitting up but that was only about 2 months worth of use 
Legs holes pretty tight 
Not sure the point 
Sheets are Rough - Love the fitted top sheet 
Form over function 
Used as a foot board. 
Good protection but it does not hide away in any way 
Don't buy unless you have box spring! 
Compared to the competition this is better BUT.... 
Doesn't work without a box spring 
good one but not the best design. 
Great while they last... 
Didn't last two months of occasional use. 
Good but not great 
A little flimsy 
Not very sturdy 
Not so sure it's worth it 
Nice cot but not perfect 
Doesn't fit most cribs 
window wedge 
hard bottom 
difficult to operate 
Roomy and functional but slow to set up and break down 
sometimes it seems locked but it's not 
Caution if you have casings around your doors 
Worked for our garage door but not the front door 
NO matter how I install it the self close mechanism is finicky. 
Good compared to some but not the best 
Overall would not recommend 
Useable but Chilly 
Good but not Great 
Bath Sponge 
Meh it's ok. 
Works okay 
doe not fit UppaBaby vista 
I wanted to like it more than I did 
There are better covers out there... 
Not the best nursing cover 
Kind of harsh 
Not that useful as I though 
Did not like the quality 
Child loves it but it's very poorly constructed 
Cute but not well made 
Came up short 
but the straight spout leaks terribly the minute it tips over 
Nice cups but some of the lids split easily 
Very comfy and acts as a head support in the carseat.... 
A bit bulky... 
meh 
Nice Idea But... 
Didn't help much 
okey no wonder 
In between 
It's Not Awful It's Not Great...It's Okay 
Good quality but won't fit well on a shallow tub 
Comfortable on knees but suction cups tore right off. 
Like the product but it didn't fit! 
its okay... 
So-so 
Needs some tweaking 
To slow 
Meh.. 
good for peace of mind 
Loved this at first! 
Grear for a while... 
Never used it to be fair 
Nice idea but... 
Gets the Job Done 
Awesome while it works... 
It's cute and does the job...could be better. 
used couple times 
A noisy turtle! 
Functional... 
Double sided bed rail. 
Hard to assemble 
ADEQUATE WITH A FEW CAVEATS 
its okay. 
Sturdy but cumbersome 
does the job 
could be better designed 
Just okay 
Could have been better 
Took up a lot of counter space 
Eh... kinda pointless 
It works... 
Some design flaws but still a decent rack... 
Decent for an outlet cover but not for shortening cords 
Work with a short cord only 
Okay but doesn't work with all plugs 
Unable to use with the electrical receptacals in our home 
Check your cord sizes 
Great idea but 
Cord Holes too Small but otherwise good product 
Good idea but a pain to \disassemble\ 
Not a convertible mini! 
Helpful for the first few months 
NOT great for women who've had a C-section 
Velcro can be annoying 
good concept 
Not ideal but works. 
Expensive for what it is. 
CUTE NOT PRACTICAL... 
Color Lighter 
Not Soft Enough 
Be careful of color choices 
Ok but not for me. 
Cumbersome but works. 
Didn't get much use out of it but not because of the product itself 
Better than original Boppy not as good as new Boppy 
Not as great as I hoped for 
No friend of mine:  not easy to use 
Wait until after the baby is born 
Just \meh\... There are better toys out there 
It is a little to firm... 
Great design--poorly made 
Useful first few weeks for first time mom 
Not good post- Csection but useful later for daytime nursing 
Bulky 
Looks good but not super functional 
Aesthetics vs. Practicality 
Doesn't last all day 
Three Stars 
Cute but cannot be properly washed 
Nice idea but not very practical 
Mixed feelings 
meh 
Good idea but my baby hates it 
Has all the right features for a first toy... 
Great toy 
sort of interesting.

Just OK 
Decent. 
Can't wash in washing machine sound is low 
Good

My baby didn't like it and broken music box 
Music could have been better 
Decent but not great

Song is NOT \If you're happy and you know it\: It's \Llorando se Fue\! 
Never got into it 
Adorable 
Nice toy

Back feathers are too stiff 
It's okay 
My son is not interested to it 
Baby ok with it 
Squeaker stopped squeaking 
Get Freddy the Firefly instead 
There are better Lamaze toys out there 
Daughter never really liked

wrist too short 
A little too expensive for what you get 
Doesn't quite fit 
Ok Rattles 
cute idea 
He's just not into them 
DIdn't take to these 
Meh - it wasn't as fun as I thought it would be 
Not so impressed. 
Cute but wish they rattled louder 
Too quiet! 
Just OK 
Hard to Use as Intended 
Wrist rattles are nice socks come right off 
Cute 
Not a fascination for every baby 
Doesn't hold baby's interest 
OK- won't last 
Overwhelming 
Great if your kid likes it! 
my son is not a big fan 
It's ok 
it's OK 
okay--but she liked the bird version more 
love freddie! 
Not so great 
mom of 5 month old 
Fifi the Firefly - cost more than Freddie 
Freddie the Firefly vs. Tucker the Turtle for a newborn 
Love Lamaze this is not their best toy 
I liked it at first but my baby never showed interest 
cute but could have diff textures 
Nice toy 
with nice textures and colors 
ok product 
Still deciding whether to keep it 
cute 
A little disappoointed 
Better suited for an older baby 
Doesn't sit straight up. 
Just alright 
Not bad..... 
Alright swing. 
Overall great buy but comes with some problems 
It's ok... 
Good 
Meh 
Gotta have a bouncy seat! 
Sad 
So so 
Good overall but water leaks 
Not as good as I thought to be 
Probably useful for others. 
just ok 
Love the chair but the toy bar is way too low 
Strange size - good material 
Is fairly ok 
Works well to put baby to sleep 
I'm sorry but this thing is LOUD 
My baby didnt like it 
Low quality but works wonders 
It's just OK 
Cute but not for the money 
A life-saver but quality disappoints. 
Full Featured Swing and She's Still Not Happy! 
Love that it's not too big! 
Works ok I guess 
Nice swing 
5 stars for comfort and functionality 1 star maybe for durability 
I really wanted to love this swing... 
Motor sounds like a loud croaking frog--updated x2 
Works okay but not impressed for the price. 
Weak Motor - same as one found in airwick air freshener 
So-So 
Not for a Small House 
Cute but gets old fast 
Kind of boring 
Eh 
Nice but.... 
Good for resting/napping but otherwise... 
I would've gotten something else 
Great for newborns but didn't help our 2 month old... 
Okay get what you pay for 
Good placemat wish it stuck to the stable better 
Works but Sort of Ugly 
2 packs = 4 sheets 
Work for the snuggle nest but could be softer 
Didn't do much but still well made. 
Disappointed that it does nothing for my baby.... 
Smells good wasn't the miracle product we were hoping for 
It didn't work 
Not for my son 
Might work for colic but doesn't seem to help gas pains 
Didn't do much for my baby 
Not too sure 
Soothes a little but not a fast reaction 
Okay but needs improving 
Good for the money 
good quality but buy in store

Not my fave 
Cute...sounds like dog toy 
Don't get the hype

Wow if I would have read the Reviews.. 
It's okay 
This thing is huge 
cute idea - ok execution 
Not really pink 
Not quite what I was expecting 
Average.... 
good BUT 
Doesn't work well with crown molding 
it works but not the easiest. 
Yes you have to affix it to wall and made in China 
ouch 
does what it claims 
Nice Wrap...but a little difficult. 
Shoulder Pain 
Steep learning curve 
Good fork spoon is worthless 
small flat and a bit flimsy 
Just ok... 
eh 
This was good and then lost it's goodness 
Pretty good 
Totseat chair... 
Fits on any chair - Baby didn't like it 
plastic sleeves are weird 
Not as cute in person 
Great idea hate the materials used! 
Decent for the price 
Does the job but quality wasn't as expected 
Happy with quality but doesn't fit correctly 
Not for fast growing babies 
Couldn't make it work for us... 
Small window of usefulness.  Fine in early infancy; unsafe for babies who try to stand. 
It comes with hard to remove giant stickers!!!!! 
Too much effort 
If you're flying solo with a toddler don't bother! 
You get what you pay for... 
Not the best design 
just another thing to fiddle with at the gate 
It works but it is unnecessary 
Protects but rips easily 
Bit of a pain but okay overall 
TEARS EASILY but does the job. 
The bag is huge and doesn't close well 
Doesn't fit Graco Snugrider stroller too well 
Made for Smaller Strollers. 
not as good 
It serves it purpose 
Good for messy toddlers 
Nice but not very usefull 
My baby is somewhat ok with it 
Okay but there's room for improvement 
Slips out easily 
Great for on the go! 
Stupid designs catch food 
I like it.. wanted to love it.. 
Does not work on wood tables 
Love it hate it but would still get it (update: oozing oil -- yuck) 
Does not stick 
Love the idea 
just ok... 
So-So 
Great idea but it won't stay flat 
Eh not great. 
Works 
Not really great for use over 8 months 
so so 
Just Okay 
Works although a little loose. 
Ok not the best 
Not good for Evenflo Glass Bottles; Better alternative out there! 
works well for drying bottles 
Lower priced but doesn't hold as much as other models. 
works well but could be improved 
What a Hassle! 
Nice plate but suction base doesn't work 
Suction doesn't work but I like the set anyway 
Starting to change shape 
Used to love 'em now I just like 'em 
Plastic is nice but they don't fit much rice 
ok bowls terrible lids 
3 stars for the 3 usable bowls 
eh 
Ok for crackers but limited uses IMO. (no travel microwave) 
Lids don't fit 
Solid color rather than the translucent in the picture. 
Not a bad brush better than brushes without sponges on top 
Good brush if used correctly 
It is pretty good 
Used to Love -- Not Anymore 
Its hidious why did they make it pink 
Good product until it broke 
It's okay but... 
Sponge tears easily 
Does the job but is too short 
Works well just falls apart 
Great until it broke 
nipple brush is too thick but otherwise good 
Nothing Special 
Doesn't last 
nipple brush doesn't have enough brissles and gets rusty quickly 
kind of flimsy but it depends on # of uses 
It's ok for the price 
Nipple brush keeps falling off after 2 months of usage 
Bad for formula great for snacks 
Does the job but could be better. 
Formula doesn't stay in individual compartments 
It's okay. 
It's okay but Avent is better 
Sturdy product. 
Theres this nifty container a platic bag or a dollar store container. This is what should be used!  : ) 
Ok for short trips 
OK product packaging was awful! 
Milk Mate Storage Containers Better 
my baby said no 
Not the ducky I ordered 
Okay... 
Keeps snack contained... 
Not super practical 
Nice idea but not that practical... 
Nice but it came just one 
Great Idea Not Practical 
Kind of big for an infant 
cute 
Picture is misleading 
Just OK 
too big for my daughter's mouth 
Best babyproofing solution out there but there must be a better way 
does the job 
Nice to have but grocery bags are just as good. 
Works Fine Would Recommend SASSY Bags Instead 
These are doggie bags 
Nice Add On 
It's okay 
Good for storage 
Serves its purpose 
Doesn't hold very many Tommee Tippee bottle parts

Nice color and style- VERY THIN 
You Get What You Pay For 
Really thin 
Very thin 
Good for the price 
Rough 
Cannot be steam cleaned :( 
To each his own...my baby prefers these more as chew toys over pacifiers 
\Colors May Vary?\ 
Good pacifier but read the fine print. 
Too big for little baby 
So so 
Cute Design - But had my regrets later on 
I don't like it but there seems no better choice out there. 
Loved the mat for a while but... 
baby started tearing up floor 
Connection issue. 
Too many pieces and only a little less garish 
Pretty but hard to clean 
Not good for crawlers 
Classy Foam Playmat 
Way too much background noise if you use a noise machine 
Very sensitive monitor 
Pretty much does its job... 
Not the best 
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor 
ok monitor 
Just OK 
So-so Monitor 
Ok if you don't plan on leaving the house 
Interference issues 
Good basic monitor for the price 
Takes a little tweaking and patience but does the job. 
Weird noises clicks on and off for no good reason 
The best of a mediocre range of choices UPDATED 4 of 5 stars... 
Good monitor but... 
Just okay 
Weird shape but still loves the taggies 
As good as it guess so far it seems 
not so firm... 
Disappointed. 
my baby sleeps well 
Mixed Review...good piece but odd size 
Good for car seat not so much a stroller

It won't stay on 
Looks good 
OK but doesn't keep baby interested for long. 
Son loves it but quality not the best 
It's just ok... 
Three Stars 
okay I guess 
booster seat 
never use it 
Sort of fits all my stuff. 
Heavy & Bulky 
Cute basket but small 
all lowercase 
Gets the job done 
Letters are a little smaller than I expected Colors are confusing for a Child 
smelled so bad 
Fun but magnet is small 
Not enough fish and fish float belly up 
ok 
It's okay nothing special 
Only OK 
Disappointed in Munchkin 
The magnets are weak. 
Fun but didn't realize they are squirters 
Spend your money elsewhere 
Review for BABY JOGGER CITY SELECT 
GET THE SKIP HOP FITS CITY VERSA 
Purchased it for the Baby Jogger City Mini 
It is really just okay 
just okay 
its ok... 
good idea poor quality! 
Perfect for our BOB but they've doubled the price 
Kind of weird... 
Good idea 
Pilling. 
More For Looks Than Use 
Good for back support 
Good for awhile then it just falls apart 
A little too thick for me 
Pretty Good 
Ok but not great 
Just okay 
Eh... Okay diaper 
Bulky and hard to dry but cute 
Eco-friendly but doesn't keep in messes. 
It's OK but not my first choice 
I like the idea of soft  flannel inside but 
Wish I could use it. 
Best as inner doubler for heavy flow or solo for very light flow. Absorbs rapidly 
Okay 
overpriced 
Would not recommend 
Cute but never worked correctly 
Cute 
Nice idea but the Baby doesn't really follow Fiona... 
Want to trow Fred off the roof... 
Does help motivate crawling but annoying. 
Broke easily but great customer service 
Worst sound EVER 
I like this product except that it does not suction down ... 
Okay 
Good product 
I want to like these but... 
Nice playmat for infants 
I want to give this 5 stars but... 
Could Be Better 
Fun Playmat 
About average

Too sensitive... 
\Brown\ is said with a frown. LOL!!! 
Cute but kinda crazy.. 
Okay... 
Just OK 
Ok 
Good product 
OK 
One foot quit working. 
Overprices on Amazon 
I guess my little guy isn't a \lovie\ kind of guy 
Cute but small. Nothing amazing. 
Soft and sweet lovey/security blanket 
Wish it was organic - polyester is not good for children (or adults) 
Didnt work for me but tasted good 
Great product! 
Get the mixed box 
Works well but only for a short period. 
Didn't work :( 
I'm not in love with it. 
Eh... 
They're okay 
Cheap mirror but I can tell what my child is doing. 
Small mirror 
alright 
Good quality; small for my baby! 
Quickly outgrown 
Not a good size 
The other reviewer is right. It shrinks! 
use these as an insert to cloth diapers 
Premium Bleached Prefolds 
Preemie 2 ply aren't worth it. 
Not good for FOLDING 
Fits perfectly. We aired it out outdoors for two ... 
lower buckle is a problem 
Very cute however... 
nice lamp 
Nice but noisy... 
These don't exactly fit older versions 
Good product 
Looks and works well but disappointed in installation options 
too small to enclose but used to block section of room 
comfortable but... 
At least the baby can use it... 
Jungle Fun  -  Quality not as good as Alex toys bath toys. 
My son has no interest in these 
Decent 
Nice idea but lacking 
Ok but for the tray 
The Good and the Bad 
Not what I expected 
Great Before Baby Learned to Pull It Off 
too small 
not so good 
Works great but cheaper at the store 
Gives me peace of mind! 
Pricey but worth it for peace of mind 
Highly sensitive to heat! 
hard to clean and put together 
Not worth the hassle to me 
I don't prefer them but my wife does.... 
Slow flow but not much else resembles natural breastfeeding 
our baby loves it but... 
I should've researched other products. 
Cute but Disappointed 
I wouldn't call this \Bestever\ it's just ok... 
Comfy for the baby 
it would be the BESTever if it were a little bigger 
Doesn't wash well 
NOT machine washable 
Splat Mat 
Cute and a good size 
Thicker than Underpants but Not Enough to Absorb Much 
Just OK 
Nice product 
Adorable 
super cute but bulky and not toddler friendly. 
Adorable - but never really used it 
Hard to unclip the \tail\ 
Harness is good but no space in \backpack\ 
No real complaints. 
Does the job cute 
Very dark can't really see baby. 
I wanted to love these . . . 
Works Well 
Works like it's supposed to - shipping left a lot to be desired 
Never could get this thing comfortable for baby 
Good wrap

Did not with well for us. 
Disappointed and not what I expected. 
Not quite what I hoped. 
Not for me 
Sizing is really tricky 
Pretty Good 
Wish it came with caps 
I No Longer Use Ameda Products! Buy Medela instead! 
It serves its purpose but would not call this 'convertible' not to mention 'portable' 
Idea is good but baby hates it. 
Beautiful Parasol 
cloth diapers 
Good but a bit rough and strange shape 
Does what it says but awfully uncomfortable. 
no really needed 
poo goes through 
Not universal! Check your outlet design carefully before you buy. 
They work... 
Kinda cheap looking 
You get what you pay for. 
okay but the arm munckin ones are better 
Cute keys poorer quality than they used to be 
Son loves it but I am not too crazy 
Child's potty chair 
Smart Design - Elevated Chair too High 
almost too much of a boost. 
Okay 
Eh. 
Works but not great 
Magnifying glass is kind of useless 
Magnifier is a hazard but otherwise these are ok. 
Meh... Works fine but no more special than others 
Does the job 
Nice product 
Magnifier doesn't help 
Clippers Work But Magnifier Not Worth It 
Good for Babies 2 months+ 
Good but some design problems - there are better clippers out there 
Does the job. 
Okay but not the best 
Kinda pointless 
Had difficulty using even w/ magnifying glass. 
durable 
Good enough nail clipper but magnifier is pretty useless 
i never use the mag glass 
Not good as I expected. 
Works Great - Until it breaks

Its Ok but could be better. 
Can't get baby to sleep on it 
not completely sold 
I liked my Babies R Us Changing Pad Better 
Doesn't always stay in place... 
Not good for other bottles 
Ok but not great. 
Still leaks difficult instructions to give to a caregiver to use 
Cute but a bit tricky 
Okay 
Doesn't stay awake 
Not a fabulous quality product 
You get out of it what you put into it 
Seems to be the best toddler clock available... However overpriced 
Works ok but a pain to set up

Keeping it bc it's too much of a hassle to return 
Crib quality

Bought the basket and the liner together 
Low price low quality 
It's okay...

Lots of work with limited usage

on the short side 
Great product but sizing is WAY off 
Okay for some my son hates it. 
BIG 
Pup Pals Smells Funny 
IT's HUGE! 
Love this but it is HUGE 
Workable but not great. 
Love Halo but this is a giant sack not safe for walking toddler 
Love the idea 
Watch the sizing 
Very Big! 
Good crib for the price/one wrong part 
Nice Crib 
Crib has just been re-engineered - now too small for standard size mattress!!!! 
It does the job 
Didn't know what to expect 
\Okay\ 
Better Products Out There 
For us yes for someone else 
Works well but the spoon is too deep 
It's ok 
Cute 
great idea but wouldn't buy it again 
Boon Ball 
It's okay 
Good size but not great 
Too big for my nine month old 
I thought you were irreplaceable... I was wrong. 
Could be better... 
A great swing in theory but both my children didn't like it. 
Not for squirmers. 
Good for what it is 
Disappointed in adjustability. 
Fun activity for babies 
Nice idea but our baby was easily bored by it 
nice 
Just O.K. 
Would have been perfect.... 
Didn't fit on our doors. 
lots of fun but a pain to adjust to height 
So far...average 
Meh. 
Baby loves it but it has a major flaw! 
good quality short-lived 
good not great 
Not for young babies 
My baby prefers the walker 
It worked as it should but there are more useful bouncers out there.. 
Fabric toys not washable 
Good quality bad battery 
Love a lot about it but it's only OK. 
Safe but extremely heavy 
I want to love it but they Shrink! 
I like that they are organic but sort of poor quality 
OK 
It's ok but the Munchkin one is Better 
Daughter doesn't like them 
Hard to open 
It's a good idea but my baby wasn't into it. 
Nice quality but too small to cuddle 
Nic ewalker doesn't work well on carpets 
Not Made For Short Babies 
Baby loves it 
Baby loves it...annoying problem for me though. 
Product Modifications Made for Outdoor Use 
... our daughter refused to stay inside and felt its like a gail so we had to get a bigger ... 
nipples collapse 
Good for using with the medela pump... 
another trick for new moms to navigate around 
Bought this for the collars 
Average Bottle for an average baby 
Meh 
The nipples on this bottle are horrible but the bottles are GREAT for milk storage 
Flimsy nipples and bottles are why these are back in the box 
great for pumping into but the oz markers wear off quickly 
Decent bottles but not my fav 
If you want to get another full night's sleep I definitely recommend buying a mattress with springs! 
Cute but........ 
It's okay 
Jumps great... toys not so great 
Concept is great product could use some upgrades. 
ehh 
Dissapointed 
seat too wide 
Not for chunky babies 
The toy is fun! 
Good but  color is not  as bright as shown in the picture 
Okay for the money but nothing fancy 
Ok but adhesive isn't good. 
don't fit drawers 
Not for side use - on top of cabinets only 
Don't work well on flush-front drawers 
Decent lock for price but has minor issues 
Good Construction but not for every application 
Not great not horrible.

Flimsy Lid 
I was expecting more 
Too Flimsy for the Price 
Can't really tell if they work 
Functional product cumbersome to use better than nothing.. 
Does not roll well 
it does the job 
Good for the price makes travel easier 
ok but doesn't fit all car seats! 
Already used it. 
A tight fit w/ the Graco FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect Travel System 
Childress Car Seat Travel Bag vs. Glad Forceflex garbage bag 
Useful but ripped on  first use... 
Really stays put but foam does not withstand squirmy kids or biters 
Colorado Heat 
my back! 
Excellent If You Have a Good Back and a Light Baby... 
lighter babies only & no large parents 
Baby Bjorn or which of three types of Ergos? From a mom of twins with doctor's tips 
Nice but made for men 
complex to put on 
Baby Bjorn vs Beco vs Ergo 
Better than \Original\ but Ergo Baby is still best... 
One major concern 
I really wanted this to work... 
Still trying to figure it out 
Not The Easiest To Use 
havent used it but it seems ok 
durable but tight 
way too short!!! 
Small 
Cute but not sturdy 
Good for toys but will not keep near my baby 
Very thin. 
Returned it never used it 
Nice cover but doesn't fit my moses basket 
Nice but not for the price 
Does the Job 
Ok 
For the price it will do.

Cute frame PITA to update 
Balls are fun to play with 
Good for the Price but Not AMAZING 
Good balls nothing special

Nice quality 
Nice looking but narrow and hard to adjust 
It's ok looks great works well enough but closes behind you automatically (which may or maynot be a good thing) 
Decent but shows signs of wear fast 
No hardware to mount to wall included 
High quality gate. Great finish 
Difficult to open and close when pressure mounted 
Hardly use it 
Baby loves the stroller & for mom it's decent 
Decent but not great 
Handle pinches my hands 
Not the best... 
Meh 
Hard to Use 
Eh not great but not terrible 
okay 
Okay but not great 
These don't seem to be as sturdy as they once were... 
Hard to Drink/ Hard to Clean 
Great cup but a few disapointments.... 
Good handles size but mold builds up 
eh... 
Not great for rear-facing 
Cleaning is an issue...customer service not helpful 
Item came in dirty 
Baby never interested 
I WANTED to like it... 
Music to go 
Okay... 
Cute toy my baby is not impressed though 
ok 
My 3-6 month son is not too interested 
good toy 
Decent toy 
A good car ride toy 
Decent fun 
Works fine but too bright 
We like this for car rides and Dr. offices 
Too FLASHY - Try a glowworm instead 
Okay toy 
Not What I Expected 
Not sure what all the hype is about... 
This would be great if it has soft fabric body/touchpad 
ok 
Not sure I'd recommend 
Good toy but not what we needed 
Good Product But Doesn't Hold Baby's Attention 
does not stay in the baby mouth 
Can't see them at night 
Just ok 
Pretty but not as functional as I'd hoped. 
Smaller than it looks 
I expected more 
Not Bad for a Smaller Bag 
Nice quality bag but way too small! 
Durable but a bit small 
Great pattern and pockets but too small 
would skip if I had a do over 
Too small... 
i picked this one so i hope it works out! 
Just okay 
You can but lipstick on a cardboard and polyester bag but... 
I'm on the fence w/this bag... 
On the heavy side 
Disappointing 
Saw in the store but didn't buy 
Good Storage/Many Useful Pockets - But the body of the bag was too narrow 
Good but not great 
Stuff falls out! 
Love the look but function....questionable 
With use developed some ripping around the seams; Skip Hop replaced. 
Well made but too small 
Wasn't big enough for my needs but seems to be of great quality 
We ended up replacing it with a bigger bag.... 
No what i thought it would be 
The camera added 10 pounds 
starter bag 
A Diaper Bag that won't go out of fashion 
If you want something with zipper this is not for you! 
Much Smaller Than Expected 
A little big 
A bit bulky! 
Works as expected but nothing special 
Does the job but the material wrinkles easily. 
Pain in the rear to iron 
Very wrinkled 
Works great only when you're crib mattress is at the highest level 
... it were a little longer to fit the crib better. The material is very sheer and wrinkles very ... 
Returned It 
Be wary of the color 
Just Okay 
Quite small 
Doesn't fit my Babyletto Hudson crib 
cute 
Not what I was looking for 
nice chair but not ideal for older baby 
Buy the Red caddy version instead 
Alright odd distance from table 
For younger babies 
Buy in burlington coat factory for 1.99$ 
Thought this would help but not so much 
Good for some things... 
its just ok 
Very cute but mildew easily. 
Easy to install and use---but a few were broken! 
Fine for awhile...then they break 
Meh 
Hard to install 
Not for Uppa Baby G-lite save your time! 
its ok 
Get the 2 oz cubes instead 
So-so 
Two Years Later 
Not enough space 
Kinda Small 
not the best bag 
LOTS OF POCKETS BUT NOT MUCH ROOM..... 
Great bag but not roomy. 
a little large 
Didn't work for me. 
Doesn't really work 
Good but like the ones without the notch 
Really Adorable Utensils - But The Spoon Is Too Big! 
Great idea but the spoon is too flat 
Cute Nice Carrying Case But Not My Favorite 
great fork ok spoon 
Cute but not perfect 
Not the best quality 
Watch your baby's fingers when spinning! 
Loved it at first but now very annoying 
if you want to get in a fight with your spouse... 
Most arrive damaged and cannot be returned 
Good Item But Could Use Improvement 
These are just \ok\ 
my baby didnt like these 
Like Soothies but better 
Eh it's okay 
PLEASE BE AWARE!! 
Not all babies love it 
nice shape wish they were softer 
I wish my son liked pacifiers... 
Doesn't turn off 
It's good BUT 
tray feels low quality-- but it does what it's supposed to. 
broke for no reason after 1 year 
Works well but still not that useful. 
It works but set-up left my husband grumbling 
Product works. Installation potentially tricky. 
Leaks wanted to love it. 
Worth buying but beware 
Nice but not that helpful. 
Nice Product 
Nice but not necessary 
Test a friends before buying if possible 
Nice chair but didn't work for us 
Good but not great 
Shoddy construction ruins otherwise nice bag 
Great quality but rather Awkward 
Not for me.... 
It's a rattle! 
Just an OK rattle--there are better ones out there. 
Rattle 
Cute but haven't used 
Just OK 
JUST A RATTLE 
I Like But Baby Uninterested 
Great first rattle - don't give to your child until they are older 
Cute-but baby not into it yet. 
Okay 
It's a Rattle 
Smaller than I thought they were 
Bummer 
Teething necessity..... 
The flower shape is great--the hearts not so much. 
Good teether 
Okay... 
Have yet to see the benefit of these... 
not the colors as pictured 
nice 
Not very noisy 
A little hard... 
Not bad but not great 
Not the same as pictured and wish there was more to soothe the gums 
Okay 
Not our favorite 
Baby didn't take to it 
Clear reception but battery issue 
Quit Working after 2 months 
they're okay 
Nice blanket but... 
Good size but just okay fabric 
does not work well as a swaddle 
Is this a joke? 
You can live without it 
My Baby loves it but watch out! 
Super Soft Fabric But Not That Great 
CHEST CLIP BROKE! Ergo was purchased in a boutique- definitely ORIGINAL. 
Ok for a carrier 
Size Matters 
Good but still looking for the perfect carrier 
Light and Sturdy 
Good but still makes my back hurt 
Difficult to put on 
Average 
might be a fake? 
ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier (camel color) 
Not easy to put on by yourself while holding baby at the same time like you are supposed to! 
ok carrier 
I don't understand the ERGO love fest.... 
not slow enough for my 1 mo old 
wide base seems misleading but they function fine 
it's ok 
Takes up too much room. 
Everything is great except color 
I like the Item 
yeah it's ok... 
Good fit comfortable but break easily 
They collapse! 
They are what they are 
Haven't used it much 
ok 
OK... with reservations 
Good seat terrible seat belt 
It's okay 
Works fine for babies 
This is NOT the Cadillac Booster Seat 
Good chair for the cost 
Okay for the price but wouldn't buy again 
Decent Reclining Chair for the Price 
ok 
Nice for the baby beginning to sit 
Fun but My Baby Tends to Lean to the Side 
Not for chubby babies.

A mixed result...

Ineffective in the war against acne 
I wish you could test it before spending money on it.

Same product in new package 
Doesn't work as well as others 
I should have known ... 
Slightly better than the usual over-the-counter products

Not As Good As Other Products Excessively Drying 
NOT the solution for EVERYONE...

COMPARED to other systems 
Not for me... but it might work for you.... 
Another acne treatment

Not bad but over priced 
not bad for the price 
OK but has a retinal derivative in it 
Not bad but . . . 
It's OK 
not really for sensitive skin 
Mixed feelings... 
Was using a lot of this stuff for awhile 
not all natural and is a bit greasy 
Average skin care product 
Felt nice but I don't think it works any miracles. 
Nice Product Not All-natural 
Great for the colder months but it remains oily under the sun 
bio oil is OK 
Haven't Seen a Change Yet 
Not for me because it contains mineral oil - a petroleum by-product. 
Basic Ingredients Work Sometimes 
oil feels nice 
It's okay 
Does this product actually work? 
What's the harm? 
sweet smell 
Satisfactory but not stellar results 
It's an oil- that's about it! 
A skincare product without Botox 
Nice but no younger 
Too greasy for me 
Too Soon To Tell But Promising 
May be problematic if you have very sensitive skin 
Not 100% natural 
nice oil not sure about the hype 
Three Stars 
It works 
not too bad 
Not resilient 
Sticky thick but makes your skin soft!

Not my favorite. 
Pass on this 
Much too stiff for the face 
Crystal clear with NO sediment or cloudy stuff!!! 
It's OK 
Decent 
Too hard to apply without smearing your shadow. 
Didn't keep my brows from smearing but does help with pencil bleeding into fine lines 
it works. 
Eyebrows 
Not what I expected 
Got moldy fast 
makes your hair dry 
ehh 
Long.  Hard to hang onto in shower. 
Vey big black Comb

Give it a try! 
Good wrap setting lotion

Be Smart about When and How to use 
It's ok but not a magic.. 
Not the best Egyptian Magic Cream I have ever tried 
Not sure.. 
It's okay but definately not magical for me. 
I don't know about magic... 
Not such a good deal! 
Silky Smooth Legs 
Similar to using Vaseline very greasy 
It works sort of. But it's also kind of scary.

doesnt always turn out right 
Smells good is cooling but 
leaves skin looking very shiny but protects 
cute but really short and thin 
Stinks and has parabens 
good but not my favorite 
I wanted this to work for me but I fear that it is breaking me out 
This does not help eith oilies... 
Good but not for me 
decent but not great. 
Avon Anew Clinical Advanced Retexturizing Peel - just ok 
Okay nothing special 
Good  product? 
Not for itchy scalp 
So so 
NEUTRAL 
No miracle but alright 
Sticky 
Just okay 
Works 
Not My Favorite 
Good as a lip balm 
It';s ok 
I wish I could share the enthusiasm 
Average 
ehhh I don't see what the big deal is? 
Smells a little odd and is quite thick. 
its ok 
Ok could be better 
Not Exacly what I thought I was getting - a lesson in ad writing. 
Not So Soft 
Simple prongs for a simple rollerset 
Not for thick hair 
Not my tool of choice for smoothing my feet 
Not that strong and dries the hair 
Leave in longer if you have black/dark brown hair 
My hair is still black after leaving it on for 35 minutes... 
soft hair 
Pretty good but not for the price 
Not worth the price 
It's ok 
Works Well enough... 
good moisture but not works for pimples. 
A 5 out of 10 so far 
Works 
Finally I can see all of my makeup essentials... 
Stiff 
Can't ask for much for the price. 
It does what it's supposed to ... 
Brightens with shimmer 
Had high hopes 
Good but not great 
Great product 
Wild ferns manuka honey eye cream 
Goes bad before you can finish it. 
Did not like it much 
Somewhat effective but not quite strong enough for me. 
Not sure if its work. 
not the same as I buy in the tanning salon 
Helpful Medication with a Lasting Aftertaste 
Not so great 
acne treatment 
2.5 % doesn't do it for me. Like the wash and lotion. 
its okay... 
Ok if you don't have tea tree handy 
Nice color but... 
Not exactly what I was hoping for 
color is just not for me 
Just OK 
Not so alluring curls 
Not sure if I will buy again 
Healed some cracks and smoothed hands but didn't feel moisturizing 
Stings 
Strong fragrance!!!! 
It works- here are the drawbacks 
does the job for a couple of uses 
Not as bad as many 
Organic 
Shampoo 
Was Okay 
It's ok 
I don't mind The Smell 
Too drying for my skin. 
Just ok 
Isn't moisturizing enough 
Great at exfoliating but too large 
Least Favorite 
No pain no gain? 
Good but too scratchy! 
Good Brush Slippery Handle 
works good on body - NOT face 
Smells like strawberry in the bottle only and then it is gone. 
Nioxin 
Ok 
Im returning it! 
Bought this on a whim 
Smells good But Price a Little High 
Okay but probably not worth the price 
Just ok 
Exfoliating Facial Gel 
It's not bad but it isn't great 
Good cleanser horrible smell 
It's shampoo 
Not bad 
Adds Shine 
Didn't feel like it worked 
Different the two times I bought it 
Works but stings my skin and eyes 
Holds warmth nicely but... 
great sunscreen but not very good under makeup 
Tough stuff 
Great but why the color?  Does my head look like a snow cone? 
reinvigorating cooling smells like Vapo-Rub 
Nothing more than a .99 cent conditioner 
Its ok. Not worth the fuss. 
- 
Kind of waxy. 
Great scent. Horrible longevity and silage. Oh...and fake. 
good for sensitive skin - gentle spot lightening 
Mixed Feelings 
It seems to work but it's oil in a bottle 
Not enough 
Nice 
Rosy Wine 
Didn't live up to the hype 
I had high hopes 
It's okay 
Great facial steamer but the steam arm needs more adjustments 
no the big deal 
Didn't work so well for me 
ehh 
Original Nail Envy 
its okay 
There are better Top Coats 
It's Alright 
small size 
Hmmm 
Makes my nails Shiney 
OPI Ridge Filler is okay nothing spectacular 
Squirts At'cha hand wash 
DIVIDED / 
Not overly impressed 
Takes a long time to cure 
could be good with the right stuff 
product is great 
OVERALL IS OK 
Ok nails 
great product but not of some sizes and always have not use for some of the other sizes 
It's okay. 
Lemon Cleanser May Not Be The Best For Sensitive Skin 
Didn't really try it 
dried up fast 
Covers well but product is thicker than I expected 
Lovely idea not so lovely effect 
I liked this a lot until I broke out 
It does have a smell 
I paid the price... 
very sticky 
It's about the smell 
Watery light scent 
Doesn't smell the same.... 
I use this to make bubble bath 
Just as messy 
it ok 
White chick 
idk 
IT REALLY DIDN'T WORK 
Be cautious 
eh 
Perfect for Polish 
so so 
Nice but 
It's ok 
Undecided 
Unpleasant to use but OK product 
Not what I expected. 
So far no 
It's just alright. 
Just average 
Okay 
Ok 
Should work nicely for those who want a gentle microdermabrasion. 
Coverage just okay... 
Three Stars 
The exfoliating beads aren't that great 
good brush 
Very Disappointing.  Pretty Enough.  But disappointing. 
I don't really like how thick the bristles are 
You better like coconut!! 
Organic 
Smells like frosting not very coconutty 
Clincher comb 
Perhaps not necessary 
It's okay 
styling creme 
Just Okay 
Ok for Neutral Polish 
Alright... 
Meh 
It burns!  It's hard to use!  But it may be effective it's organic and made in USA 
Waiting for it to work 
it doesn't work for me and it smells wired! 
An OK spot treatment. 
Just meh 
Much less expensive alternative available 
Seems to work for alot of people but not for me 
burns 
same as bye bye 
Ehh.. 
okay 
Decent shower tool 
An okay scrubber... 
A campy unnecessary \macho\ loofah for the Nascar set... 
There is better and cheaper out there. 
Interesting Idea But Is It Really Necessary? 
This little tool does the trick to an extent........ 
Body Scrubber 
Gimmicky but not bad 
Ho-hum--nothing THAT different from what's already out there 
Fun but not exactly a necessity 
Scrub a Dub 
It so so 
Small and overpriced. 
For the price it works. 
Works 
It's good 
GREAT PRODUCT-SPILLAGE PROBLEM 
Doesn't thin as much 
mehh 
so so product 
Eh... 
Worked out well for what I needed it for but... 
I have mixed feelings about this 
DEFINATELY NOT the Holy Grail! 
It's alright 
not as pictured. 
I don't see anything amazing. 
Minimal Damage dye HIGHLY DAMAGING \refresher\ 
Ok product for money. Hair clips are pretty much useless though 
Just okay better off getting something else. 
good color but very drying 
just regular shampoo dyed red 
cant give an accurate review 
Fine nice texture 
eyecream is not that effective 
olay eye wrinkle cream 
Smell not so great 
Yes and no 
DEFINATELY NOT the Holy Grail! 
Great 
Great cleaser; terrible pump 
Love the detangling and softness it gives. 
Scent a little too strong 
A lot of hype 
Just average Doesn't live up to the hype 
A little loose... 
Kind of a disappointment 
Good not the best 
It's okay 
Ehh... 
Fast drying 
Well...Not Actually what I expected 
not what I expected 
Not a fan. 
idk 
Unfortunately Popularity Potion doesn't work for me :( 
Be careful how much you use 
Not great for long hair 
So so 
Meh 
So far nothing..but I've only added it to my conditioner not my hair dye. 
YACHT MAN METAL by Myrurgia EDT SPRAY 3.4 OZ for MEN 
Read the other reviews 
Almond and Honey? 
It's okay smells good! 
Really intense fake-y smell 
Not crazy about the smell 
Leaves skin very soft. 
Nothing spl skin is dry 
Just Okay for Me 
So Far So Good - Updates Coming! 
it is good but not the best 
its okay 
MY WIFE SAYS IT HAS A FISHY ODOR 
Great if you can get past the smell 
Does what it's meant to 
Not really my type 
lasts a long time but scent seems to change based on body chemistry 
It's not all that. 
OOOHHHH 
Chips and not true color 
It's not what it's supposed to look like 
Not really Tiffany blue 
audrey 
Got a completely different color than I ordered 
looks different in person 
burnt monster/beautiful 
would say i liked it but it REALLY was a pain in all ways 
Colors different from other covergirl products 
CoverGirl Creamy Natural Liquid Foundation 
alright mascara 
just okay 
Weights down lashes and a bit too hard 
Brush is way too FAT doesn't allow for detailed application 
covergirl lineexact liquid eyeliner 
Works great but broke out 
Beware if you have dairy or lactose issues 
a tad bit disappointed 
Not worth the money 
Smells yummy 
It's not better than a good moisturizer 
So So 
Just ok 
Just another gimic? 
I thought it worked. 
Works but not a good value 
exfoliates but no blackhead eraser for me 
Cleans Well - Not worth the cost 
\Eraser\ is a bit too potimistic of a word 
Been there before 
Name is misleading 
An expensive option for face cleaning. 
Good cleanser 
Okay acne and blackhead prevention...from Clean & Clear. 
What's an eraser? 
Does about the same as any other acne product over the counter... 
CLEANER but not an ERASER 
Forty Bucks Worth of CRAZY! (UPDATED) 
Great concept.... 
Good for prevention but doesn't erase them 
i think i'm allergic 
refreshing but doesn't do the trick 
Doesn't actually clear away the blackheads 
Makes your skin feel clean 
Not all it is cracked up to be 
Works okay... 
No blackhead eraser 
It Does Reduce Blackheads But... 
Good vibrations 
More of an exfoliator type product 
good price for a portable cleaner 
I don't see how this can be any better then scrubbing yourself 
Nothing to cheer about 
Good for skin massage not so good at removing blackheads 
Another not so good eye cream 
Not Great but Not Bad either.... 
It's ok 
not the best product for my skin 
Night Treatment is O.K.. 
lasts a long time 
RoC Multi-Correction Night Treatment - yucky ingredients 
it bit to harsh 
I Only Use 2 Colors! 
4 different sizes 
Okay for an inexpensive set. 
Cheap 
nail bruches 
Didn't notice any difference. 
It works..but please be careful 
Okay 
day one: notes from a peeled chicken 
Chest acne 
Not what I ordedred. 
Please be CAREFUL - Read this first! 
didn't do anything? 
Its okay 
Eh 
Fine but not worth the money 
Good as moisturizer 
Eh 
No significant difference but it didn't make redness worse 
serum 
Ok but not as expected 
Well it's not working for me as well as it is for other ppl but... 
Not Sure About This Yet . . . 
Purchased for my bleach fried hair... 
Cheap looking but does the job. 
nice 
HAIR DONUT 
For \Little\ Bun 
Received my product early 
Meh 
Can't Get It To Look Like Picture 
Meh 
Fun 
Mixed feelings 
Donut? 
Stink odor 
Too big of a bun for me.. 
Works with any type hair 
Just Okay 
Good End & Bad End 
OK - For the Price! 
whooah 
don't order in hot weather 
... 
Not strong enough for me 
Tingle Effect Wore Off Quickly 
Love it larger size brush is more stable and lasts longer 
Almost a really good mirror. 
Washed off pretty quickly 
Eh it's hair spray 
Almost too effective - have to use sporadically 
Okay but not the best! 
milkyway saga gold remy 
I tried many fragrance free shampoos and conditioners 
Not the best for my hair 
It's ok 
Didn't fit my 1996 Fender Strat... 
HAS TO GET USE TO THE SIZE 
maybe not the best but it serves it's purpose 
Standard guitar cable 
average cable 
Good for the Price 
Does Its Job 
There used to be better stuff 
kinda worked kinda didn't 
Thin cables... 
Not bad but the Cool Cat line is $4 more and a better build 
A reasonably decent capo that you can afford to leave somewhere 
Just an ok capo 
Silk and steel strings 
OK 
lot of money for foam 
My mistake for buying sight unseen. 
Nice Guitar but sounds 
3 Stars Good value but it needed a lot of work 
Not mahogany.... 
Great design - love the switch 
Disapointed in Planet Waves 
The most basic of basic distortion pedals 
It's been around for decades but..... 
Great just not what I was looking for in sound 
Using it for Danelectro Mini Amp 
Step to turn on/off 
serious musicians look elsewhere 
Too much noise 
Durability Issues with Potentiameter 
Not Enough Pressure For A Mandolin 
So far so good but may have found something much better. 
Screws strip too easy but good if you can screw in 
Good 
Works but had to \ruin\ a strap for everything else. 
Aquila is better 
It gets the job done. That's what matters right? Aha.... 
Three Stars 
Provides Some Protection 
Not Bad Picks... 
Not Bad 
They work 
A lightweight contender 
Good strings for the money! 
Not the right feel 
Good picks with ok grips 
Gator Grip? 
So-so 
Good & Bad 
These Are Purple Not Black!! 
Stubby is right 
OK 
Small Hard Good for Lead Guitarists Only! 
Good pick not great 
Good just not for me 
Too small 
Depends on what you're playing 
Nice pick but try the XL 
OK but nothing special 
Strikes and gutters ups and downs. 
Not what I would grab to play with 
Not sticky enough 
Better than nothing 
Nothing Special 
OK? 
does the trick 
Planet Waves Humidifier 
Simple Product Kind of Inconvenient 
meh. 
Good product idea could causes problems for some people. 
Works not great. 
cheap 
Nothing Special 
regular. 
Using Pedals With it is a Mixed Bag 
It's ok 
slippery and young 
Not bad; it is well written

Short and sweet... 
Well.... 
Feels incomplete 
So agree . . . 
Enjoyable

Not quite what we 
Just a food chopper 
SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED.

Does the job 
Good for very fine fast chopping 
Hit or miss... 
Paddle broke within 2 months 
good but could be better 
good for sobet not for an ice cream 
Not exactly instant gratification 
Makes great ice cream but motor has problems 
The ice cream maker makes clunky noises and doesn't always work correctly 
Louder than my dishwasher!!! 
Some other fittings may not work with this fitting 
Works. Not without duck tape 
Work great reliable but use lots of power. Buy digital ones. 
it didn't work at first 
Avoid if you have small kids 
Ok for the Price 
Not blown away... pun intended 
Probably the best available today but 
Ability to move air is limited 
Pros and Cons

Eureka 
cargo box 
Lasko fan OK 
Does what its's supposed to do but 
Vacuum Cleaner 
Okay vacuum for the price. 
cheap parts 
Pretty good overall very good for the price 
A powerhouse of a canister vac but... 
Can be annoying 
Not As Advertised. Kill-A-Watt shows it as a 10 amp motor... 
Decent but not great 
The little vac that almost could... 
Vacuum OK Flimsy but still works 
Ok for quick sweeps 
Just got it!  It is heavier than I expected. 
There are better options available... 
Has a hard time picking up anything but Lint. 
Almost perfect

Unit can tip over! 
It turns the beater bar

It works pretty well -for one slice on a small brick. 
Well it's big.

As expected - at least for lemons 
Works with a  little tweaking 
I'm Not Impressed 
As ricers go this one is really nice. 
Only one size 
Very hard to press 
Potato Ricer 
Smaller that I anticipated 
Gets the job done but could be better. 
Could be better 
Three stars = it's okay 
Rust 
Not up to the OXO standard. 
Wooden Version is Better 
It's OK. I prefer my wooden one. 
Great until... 
after two years... 
good pullup locking mechanism 
VERY long for kitchen use 
OXO rubber doesn't hold up over time 
Okay but harder to control 
A Nice Solid Unit But Wire Is Fragile 
just \okay\...  maybe a little better now (read add-on) 
The locking mechanism broke 
Okay Until It's Not 
Meh 
Its ok 
It's worth the money 
Basic winged corkscrew without bottle opener 
OK Corkscrew But Mostly Plastic 
I'd keep looking elsewhere--this is just okay.... 
Doubtful of longevity 
Works But Lacks The Sturdiness To Instill Me With Consumer Confidence 
Half the time Cork gets Split 
Way too big.. 
Liked older version better 
Very useful but annoying 
Newer Model Not an Improvement 
Takes up a lot of room 
My old one is better 
OK but I like the Softworks model better. 
Lid keeps breaking 
The top and outer basket were fine. 
Take it from someone who makes 12-14 salads a week... 
Large is really medium-sized 
Great at what it does... but.... 
It was great but the internal mechanism was plastic 
Disappointed! 
Good enough but disappointing quality. 
Works ok 
its okay

Not flexible

Ok 
Does the job 
Just OK 
Limited in applications 
Flexible 
Lost its edge... and a few stars in the rating 
Well built but basic tech 
Mash them Taters 
No so great. 
Simply above average 
not up to the GoodGrips name 
Best Feature Is Also The Worst... 
Better than a regular ice cube tray 
Very wide 
bulky and expensive 
Could be better 
great tray but the price stinks 
Not the best Oxo product 
It's okay... 
Handy but could be sturdier 
Oxo vs Zyliss seafood picks + Progressive seafood scissors 
Good brush but awkward to use 
Ehhh Ok 
Not as good for DISH scrubbing as I'd hoped... 
so so 
Great but problems later on... 
Maybe not so great... 
not so sturdy 
Handle is horrible 
Not as \Super Fine\ as described 
Check Out OXO's Other Pie Server First 
The Stainless Steel start rusting... 
lightweight but ok 
Good can opener 
Mixed results 
Works great for awhile then stops working after a year 
Would be better with all-stainless construction 
Easy to use but doesn't complete the job 
it's just ok 
Strong material scrapes my pans. 
O 
Decent bowl but needs a couple of tweaks 
Basic mixing bowl 
Whistle blows and so does their customer service 
Okay but not great; too inflexible 
I'm not sure - 'twas a gift for someone else 
Fair overall 
seems great but got damages at 1st time use 
you'll love silicone for cooking scraping and spreading 
Spatulas 
Great scraper don't call it a chopper 
Not a chopper 
Useful!!

They're Nce 
No 3/4 Cup and Handles are a little short 
Good sturdy measuring cup 
Not your ordinary measuring cup 
Work Well but I'd like a few more... 
Not up to OXO standards of functionality. 
Not liking those handles

The handles are NOT bendy - I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about 
good cups bad handles and clasp 
These are OK but pricey 
Limited 
Decent but rather plain 
not what i expected from oxo 
Meh.  They measure but I still prefer my old plastic ones... 
Good but needs improvement 
Updated version-heavy duty! 
Nice But will they stand the test of time?

Okay 
Expected More at the Price Point 
Like The Rubber Grip

They hold water

Good quality but not perfect 
This Fork Is Huge 
Has some flaws but it does mash potatoes. 
Not so great inflexible very sharp 
nothing impressive

Works a bit messy and wasteful. 
Good value but performance is so-so. 
Effective but awkward 
Open question 
It works great but... 
Nothing spectacular 
Nce to look at but harder to use than Fagor 
Beautiful expensive choice 
smaller than expected 
So-So 
Still not sure! 
Unwieldy 
Good Whisk for Light Duty 
We got the wrong one but Amazon did treat us well about it 
OK 
Not what I perceived... 
A bit slippery 
A bit tricky to use. 
Nice idea but it takes some work to get the tortillas to stay put... 
Probably Works w/Moderation 
Quirky but it does work 
eh 
Another Pan ?  Is this really needed ? 
Non-stick? hahahahahhahaha 
Comme ci comme ca. 
Not bad not great 
Not necessarily 18x13 
So close to being great. 
Rust pretty fast but bake well 
not a deep dish pie pan 
If you don't need the lid this is a great pan 
Picture is deceptive...read the dimensions 
Easy to use 
Nice but Not Durable 
OK 
great idea scratches too easily 
The almost perfect beaker 
great measure but I hate that it is plastic

It's Okay 
OK as slicing guide rather flimsy. 
Not bad

Handles are the downfall 
Bargain but dangerous 
Mandoline Slicer 
Thickness 
This is a good item for the price... 
It Slices... and thats all! 
If You're That Lazy 
Bit of a gimmick 
Works 
Not exactly what I thought 
Probably not worth it 
Might as well just crush the garlic with your knife 
I feel dumb for buying this. 
Works for one-two cloves of garlic at a time 
Works fine. 
Loved the colander until the foot broke off. 
Nice 
the protruding feets make it annoying to clean. 
Flimsy but gets the job done.

They work 
disappointed 
good product just a little flimsy 
Good but has a design flaw 
It works with a little strong arm.....

not as pictured 
Okay

Cuts But... 
Very stiff & uncomfortable 
Great Tool 
decent quality good for price 
Okay but small 
too long; should be 3 inches 
Paring knives all alike 
Eh 
Not Sharp 
Not bad 
Good knife slow and poor customer service...lifetime guarantee if you are willing to wait months. 
Not a Heavy Cleaver as Described 
It's fine for my occasional use 
It's Okay. 
You get what you pay for 
OK but not as good as I thought it would be 
Heavy bread knife 
They are knives they cut but dull on arrival 
Stay sharp 
Not perfect - but good 
Okay set. I should've gotten forged

It's ok coating scratches very easy 
It works but it's not completely leakproof

It sticks... 
Its not like the pans 
Not what it claims 
Cake pan 
Works Fine

Caveat emptor 
close shave 
Doesn't work well if you shave infrequently 
Over-priced Over-bladed 
great 
Works great 
Great shave but way too costly 
Good product to add to your Amazon purchase.  Knocked off stars because of Gillette's confusing product system. 
I like it because it is cheaper than the same brand at the store... 
Ugh 
Expensive but good 
Save your money. These blades are a rip off! 
Blades Good 
Great product 
Fantastic but not in my &#34;club&#34; anymore

HOW DOES ONE RATE A VITAMIN? 
a neutral review for this one 
I LIKE OTHER SUPPLEMENTS MORE 
Don't buy this in bulk. 
I would suggest buying the 6 foot hose instead

Won't get the really big stuff off. 
Better to get whole seed & grind it yourself 
Didn't like purchased for price though 
So far so good 
Only a slight improvement... 
Great for leg cramps 
Ok for stainless not great does streak

Hoping For it to Taste Better 
High protein yet bland flavor aftertaste and dry cakey texture 
A little bitter not very peanut buttery but 20g of protein in 80 cal is great 
Meh. Tastes like nothing much. 
Higher in protein than most competitors 
Taste Could be Better. 
I liked the taste but it does have sugar alcohols. 
Only if you need sugar free and gluten free 
It tastes okay but not very peanut butter-ish 
Love 'em but not the calories. 
Too dense 
Decent tasting a bit dry 
Texture and taste a bit off 
Protein filled pipe dream

Greasier than I expected 
This seems to be the rawest salt that I have purchased and in fact appears dirty. This is very different than the salts I ... 
A bit wet. 
wonderful taste 
I purchased this salt but never used it 
To say this has minerals and is therefore healthy is misleading and deceptive - this is SALT. 
I don't get the hype 
Good - Not Great - Chai 
thought it would be better 
Tastes good.  THey were hard to stop eating 
Not the Best Certainly Not \Gourmet\

Decent quality panko bread crumbs 
Entirely Adequate

My son doesn't like them 
Nobody in my family likes these

So so 
Toffee taste is great...but... 
Toffee Stevia liquid sweetener 
Okay 
Not very sweet and has a slight chemical taste 
Good but really sweet 
Great Price Okay Tea. 
No better than regularly shaped tea bags. Not worth the extra cost. 
Too Good to Be True? 
Not what I am looking for 
A little too coarse for my tastes but I am going to grind it up finer. 
I'm kind of 'Meh' about this one ... 
Heard wonders but not so much 
The quality may be there but the taste isnt 
great taste 
Unusual taste 
Tastes like other unpasteurized honey but far more expensive 
A bit weak 
Extremely mild taste very low acidity 
Smooth but with a bitter after-taste 
Tastes OK & It Is  Low Acid 
It was \okay\ but not a 'gourmet' coffee

Average coffee no discernable difference in acid content 
Not what I expected

Definitely low acid but slightly low on flavor too 
Nice if your stomach needs the low acidity 
It says pack of 10 three ounce bags just got one! 
Just okay 
It is definitely coffee 
Low marks for flavor and fragrance. 
Just \Okay\ Low Acid Coffee 
Like watered down & weak Turkish coffee 
I still had heartburn with Puroast 
Tastes the same as Starbucks. 
Weak Aroma And Taste Just OK 
Mild with a nutty aroma 
Low Acid-Weak Taste 
Hard to tell 
Low acid but lacks flavor 
Nothing To Write Home About 
A bit bland but not a bad alternative 
I am on the fence... 
In the end it's the taste that matters 
Soothing to stomach. Unappealing taste. 
Too Expensive Somewhat Bitter 
Not my cup of coffee... 
Good... if you need it 
OK 
DARK French Roast?  It's bland and weak...... 
A Decent Average Coffee 
A Great Crunch but a Poor Flavor

3 songs 
Enjoyable from beginning to end.

overrated 
Not his strongest effort but still good

Is an album that was great but is dated now still good? 
his first solo album

Good solo debut 
Good album overdoes it on the bump and grind stuff 
BackBack or forth and forth 
R. Kelly featuring Aaliyah

This CD is OK. 
A group for today but not for posterity

Not one of my favorites.......um well.....i cant say it.... 
Soundtrack music 
Trip-hop trips up a little 
princess tracey! 
&quot;Protection&quot; left vulnerable by high expectations

Had its moments 
Hint of greatness to come 
three decent tracks; rest average 
Cool beats from the mid-1990s British Invasion

Average Underwhelming and Immature - 3 Stars 
Toni's breakthrough album. 
Only Slightly Above Average

A decent sophomore effort... 
Gotta Love Her Voice! 
Quite Frankly This Could Have Been Better. MUCH Better. 
Outkast cash in 
Good Not Great!! 
Thug? Gangsta? what??? 
Strong entry for his catalog 
Good but NOT GREAT

Technically impressive craziness leaves room for songwriting maturity 
Good But Overrated

Prophetic? 
As much as I love Johnny Gill... 
So-So! 
Let's Get the Mood Right 
All The Great Singles! -1 +2 =? 
PLEASE  someone out there help me! 
Not bad but the flaw is the edited versions of LH and ANMHE!!! 
Missing Medley 
I liked it but was not blown away. 
Not required listening but at times rewarding

OK but still lacks that 70's magic 
3-1/2 stars 
3 1/2 stars--I liked it more back then 
Pretty good... 
Too many cooks spoil the chocolate mousse

Worthwhile! 
A Great Choice For The E.J. Fan Who Has It All 
The real reason to get this is the \Friends\ album tracks 
Cameo 
All and all...it cannot compare to the earlier TFF 
Hot and cold 
Contains some good songs and a ton of photos of the band's lead singer 
Great but look elsewhere if more than a casual Abba fan 
Ain't Enough Meat On These Bones 
Live 1992 Concert Mixes Old And New Songs. 
Magic of Red Rocks and the Orchestra is there - Production is Not 
Scorching sex-a-thon still relevant 
Some great moments 
a country band with a rock attitude 
Some great singles mixed with real losers. 
3 big hits omitted 
LIVIN' ON MY HAIR 
The Band Truly Reached a &quot;Cross Road&quot; in their Careers 
Great CD 
Decent Start...but hopefully a better one will come along

Source of several much-played 1970 songs. 
A very nice album

IT IS NOT GYBR! 
How fantastic? 
Elton Takes A Stab At Significance 
Far from Elton's best

Not so Poetic 
almost a threshold but... 
Not My Cup Of Tea 
Running out of new ideas for psychedelia 
bigger eagles fans then me 
This is okay but it's missing a lot... 
earlier stuff better 
All good things must come to an end 
The Eagles go out not with a bang but a whimper 
Great good and awful in about equal measure 
An album that the band didn't want to make 
The Long Run Indeed 
THE EAGLE HAS LANDED 
Disappointing last effort from the Eagles 
Not as bad as many people say

A step down from the previous two 
THE BEGINNING OF THE END 
They pretty much bottomed out here 
Shake It Up is NOT remastered as the first three albums were.. 
Still 'reckless'...but in a bad way. 
Complex experimental record mixing folk rock jazz and fusion 
Burned brighter before 
Don Felder tried his best to shape them up... 
Not the best not the worst from the Eagles 
It's decent but much like Browne's career it all sounds the same 
decent 
Over Rated 
Too laid-back 
a good start but not as powerful as what was soon to come 
listen to it for the non-hits 
Good Primer But Not That Memorable 
Just Too Close To Distortion 
Good Concept Decent Songs 
Finding their way from country to rock 
OK for casual fans 
Not as good as the first one 
eagles greatest hits i like a few songs on it i am going to tape it then send it back if possible want a return slip. 
worth getting for seven bridges road 
This is okay but it's missing a lot... 
Skip it and get \Hotel California\ and \Long Run\ instead 
Jackson branches out not for the better 
Almost completely forgotten 80's JB

This is a good album 
Good for the Sisters fan.

It All Depends On What Your Looking For 
Too much politics too little of the personal 
pretty good 
\Looking East\ Like Tequila  Is  An Acquired Taste ! 
3 memorable songs and the rest is competent 
Jackson loosens up a bit tackling a variety of styles but seemingly as an attempt to mask writer's block 
Average Browne Release

Umm.. The best Ween country album? 
&quot;Nobody Knows&quot; how good this is. 
Compelling but not coheisve 
I am so Confused... 
Buffalo Springfield 
Decent but Again is far better 
My opinion - for what it's worth 
A Tentative Debut 
Young  For What He's Worth  Saves it! 
first album 
Jackson Browne out 
Someone's choice for &quot;best of&quot; but not the right one 
One man's best is another man's.... 
Jackson Browne's work is better represented elsewhere 
Nice intro but incomplete and too many slow songs. 
Triple threat 
L.S.G................T.I.G.H.T! 
Its Ok 
+1/2 - Judy Collins finds her voice as a songwriter 
WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THAT

Not in their best form. 
Not as successful as the later &quot;Ah Um&quot; recording... 
As Is

Three and a half for a fun album 
Back in the days i thought.. 3 1/2 stars

A sonic blending of instruments and lyrics with depth 
Some good songs but a bit too clinical in sound. 
Rush's Low Point of the Early 90's - But Getting Better 
A satisfying album. 
Better 
Poorly Remastered 
Rush - One Of The Band's Lesser Studio Releases 
The Rush universe evolves yet again... 
I feel really bad about this but... 
Rush Make Magic On 'Presto' 
Phil Collins Means Business On This &quot;Serious&quot; LP 
SONGTRESS OF SOUL! 
Surprisingly rarther uninteresting. 
It's Not As Bad As You Think...But...

Unsatisfying 
Decent Rush album

I can't believe other people gave this 5 stars! 
The Purple Arena-Eater is Slain (Pardon the Terrible Metaphor) 
Not an easy task to follow Machine Head ! 
A talented band hits problems 
Keep you busy as a bee could be...

Timely for the election and their political take on society

not a fan of this one 
Weakest Van Halen album by far 
The beginning of the end.

No bounceback for the B-52's 
B-52's - 'Bouncing Off Satellites' (Reprise / WEA) 
\Love Removal\ Resulted  In Some Fun Removal 
A new sound (and a horribly inconsistent one).

Try to imagine what silence looks like. 
MOST Over-rated album of the Genius known as Prince DO NOT buy first! 
Not bad but they've done a little better 
pretty Good Set

Doesn't sound as good as it used to 
I like the CD but wish it was only the original song line up without the bonus tracts.

Balance & Options REVIEW! 
3 Stars 
Not a masterpiece but contains two great singles. 
Honest Brutal and Afraid of You 
Leave The Singing To Stuart Murdoch 
Just about half good 
Confused mild success 
Decent but doesn't hold a candle to &quot;Sinister&quot; 
There is more and better 
Great tunes but lacking 
Ups and Downs 
Brutality at its best 
Good Album 
Eminem 
Overrated slighty dated but still brilliant in spots 
Some great rap but it's definitly not pretty. 
Not impressed 
Funny lyrics and.....what else? 
this is one nasty sick MFer!!!! 
Slim?? You There?? 
TOO  VULGAR  FOR  ME 
Not a bad album but often scandaluous for its own sake.

Worthy side-dish 
Okay should have been an EP ...  IN MY OPINION

Too much sweetness? 
Kitty's Summer of Love 
I must be too old...

Triple Six presents... 
So-So Mixtape 
As So-So as 3 Stars Would Indicate. 
A Star Came 
Very interesting adventurous debut

This was rushed; could have been better 
Chocolate Starfish Hot Dog Water Mix 
The New Street Fighters 
I won't totally flame this CD but... 
What happened to Durst &amp; Co.? 
Not really special generic 
Infantile laughable retarded yet catchy. 
Music you can jam to but talent is lacking 
Combine the first two albums and you get this one

Oh so average 
Same as Significant Other but... 
The downward spiral continued 
Solid Debut

Amazing.  It's great when obsolete technology saves the day! 
There are better Zip drives out there 
Handsome Case 
Lock and secure 
Good protection comes with a trade off 
Overpriced But Necessary 
These batteries are 1200 mAH 
Epoxy didn't bond well 
Poor build-quality but otherwise it does what it should 
Not shock resistant 
Great style but an important flaw 
I like the Palm IIIe

This isn't glossy or semi-gloss 
So so

Good Sound Poor Fit 
Excellent Isolation Terrible Cord 
For Big ears 
Like the Koss \Spark Plug\ better 
Nice idea could be better implimented.

Great fit in the ear 
Stay away. Quality has declined. 
I dont like

Not living up to the hype 
Okay.  Not spectacular.

Hey it's $16 
Good but there are much better headphones in this price range. 
Not Bad But Underwhelming 
Ok sound poor fit on a smallish ladyhead

No the Sony MDR-V600 does not compare to the Sony MDR7506 model 
Sony MDR-V600 does not equal MDR-V6

OK for the price and I like the design and fit so I keep buying them 
Good replacement not much else. 
Broke before 6 months 
Will NOT work with iPhone 4

Breaks easy 
Beware of the extra expenses! 
Best thing since Sony CFS-W455 
Very weak capacity for full screen 
Good cable 
USB cables

Senor is suitable for the location where it is used 
Not much tape

READ THIS before you buy and SAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE! 
Great Idea Still Needs Work.

Oudated Technology. No Need to Buy it New. 
What's the next step? 
Quite a device - 20 years ago 
Excellent product but .... 
Wipes information when battery dies 
Holds a lot but.... 
Good for reducing the shelf space of your CDs and DVDs 
CD Album overpriced about 1000 percent 
A real world comparison 
Not all it is cracked up to be. 
used look ugly but working 
Good Feature Set But Easy To Break 
connnected 
Good Cable! 
Very Tight Connector will damage your equipment 
Good sounding cable but cheaply made connectors 
Great Cable! 
Optical is optical 
No complaints 
It is what it is... 
A bit dissapointing 
Just a standard powerstrip 
Does the job but would prefer the plugs to run the other way. 
Not so perfect 
Works Well long life. 
jury's still out 
Works okay; don't use the coax cable connector 
Provides plenty of connections but it is a bit bulky. 
Surge Protection and Power Noise Reduction 
What's your budget? 
Make no different with the two Dollars Splitter 
Probably overpriced; promised benefits are illusory if you have digital cable 
Monster splitter 
Problems? 
Problematic 
Once great now forget it. 
You May Not See Your Rebate 
Good value but watch out for compatibility

well constructed radio with great reception 
So-so little radio at great price 
Power Outages

Doesn't  have features I want/need 
Good and decent but not for everything 
Oi 
Not a comfortable fit at all.  Sound is clear but quite weak compared to the JVC HAS160 
Good value for cheap headphones 
Good bargain but low quality

Not GREAT...But they will do in a pinch... 
Works well; uncomfortable; easily broken 
Adequate Headphones Get What You Pay For 
Jack doesn't fit with certain iPhone cases. 
Uncomfortable 
Rather tight 
Low Priced did the job and didn't last long 
They're $4 
Too basic 
Panasonic headphones 
Worth the low price but not a dime more. 
earphones 
Lightweight Panasonic headphones 
for $4.50 you can't get a better headphone than this but uncomfortable to wear. 
The price is good 
You get what you pay for - a good thing for the right price. 
Good cheapys. 
fine 
You get what you pay for 
Sound is nice but design is poor 
Super cheap and lightweight 
worth the low price; sound fine; not very comfortable 
If your search was \folding headphones\ in electronics relevance keep looking!  These DO NOT FOLD! 
Fits nice on the head 
ok 
A fair card 
They're OK 
You can't go wrong with Bushnell 
a little heavy 
The lens covers are loose and never stay in place!

Excellent product once installed. 
Great Camera when it Decides to Work 
great quirky confusing 
Lens holds a special place in my heart 
Canon's EF 35-80mm f/4-5.6 III... 
Not really worth the money unless... 
Is this lens as bad as some people say it is? 
Can do without it 
get something else if you can 
Canon EF 75-300mm 
good quality missing and important feature 
You get what you pay for but that's not such a horrible thing. 
Entry level telephoto lens 
Nice Lens... 
t&eacute;rmino medio 
The Canon EF 75-300MM zoom lens 
not bad but clearly entry-level 
It' Ok

Ok for the money but there are better options... 
Should have kept saving $$ 
Its a good starter lens 
Good for the price 
Good average telephoto zoom. 
move up one more small notch 
Slow lense 
it's ok 
useless without a tripod 
Meh (or in more technical terms cheap lens soft focus slow) 
Pay for cheap get cheap... 
A nice thrifty choice. 
Pretty slow. 
great value but you will desire more shortly 
Depends on your expertise and budget. 
Good Price - Fair Optics - Limited Performance 
Could be better 
Alright for the price 
Great for the price 
unsteady hand be aware 
Long Focal Length on the Cheap 
A good lens when limits are understood 
Not good for Aviation photos but might be ok for portraits 
Better options exist 
380ex is great as a fill flash 
Using 380EX with my Rebel XTi 
Missing Common Sense Parts 
The Eye Cups are TERRIBLE.... 
Canon EF80-200mm f4.5-5.6 II 
Sima Lens Pen not exactly what I expected 
Can't tell yet I guess.

Ok. 
40 feet maybe not 4 miles 
Good as long as it works 
Now what did I do with this camera 
Brother P-Touch Tape can be cranky 
Not very crisp... 
Nice flash warranty service a bit of a pain... 
The best price and performance for the money 
not packaged as I expected 
It worked 
Bad roll encountered 
Ok average or slightly below average photos 
USE THIS CHEAP CAMERA ON THE BEACH & IN WATER 
Pale washed out colors 
OK underwater shots but are very grainy 
decent all around temporary camera 
Worked well but when you factor in cost of processing might not be worth it 
Disappointing Picture Quality 
You get what you pay for 
OK if you only need to carry this camera. 
OK bag for camera with lens 
Ok but oversized 
Broke at 6 months. Service Email Box Full. 
Not  par with otrher case logic products 
Does the job but kind of a pain 
Could be better 
OK if you are not going to be taking the ties on and off 
Not quite what i expected. 
Equipment Tag 
Does not fit any of my cases 
Good performance at a decent price...not the best if you travel a lot. 
'Toy' factor not quite worth the price of admission. 
Good idea imperfectly executed 
Lie about 1 Mega Pixel photos 
Allright 
Get the Case Logic CPS50 
Great for the price 
Read Product Description and You will Know 
functional but a bad design 
No Microphone Volume? 
Nice camera but falls short on convenience 
Good but got some bugs 
average device for an above average price 
Cannot expect much - 1st generation product 
Eh... does the job but... 
Works ok with some quirks 
Decent Trackball Mouse with a Few Drawbacks 
Different strokes 
Logitech Got It Backwards 
Not Vista friendly 
It's ok.... 
TRACKBALL 
Total battery hog. I'd recommend the corded version of this--not the newer model :-\\ 
Great track ball with a limited two year life span 
Not for me. 
Short battery life 
Works OK but is out of date 
Works well but receiver is too big 
works ok small black speck in lens 
\This should be standard Meade!\ 
Not the T-RING I needed for my Canon T3i Camera 
What you need to take pictures with your 35mm SLR camera... 
tiny screen 
Yeah its OK 
Good entry level PDA 
Small screen little memory...take a pass 
The only great thing is the price 
Why the prices keep dropping... 
fair pda... 
Bike rail circumference matters mount might not fit your bike 
Half works perfect 
Probably OK for the devices it fits (Does NOT fit etrex 10/20/30) 
Works but cost is too high 
Holds well but a little shaky 
Doesn't work with eTrex Vista HCx 
the clamp does what it should 
Not for Vista Cx unless you have \that little plastic piece that came w/the gps\ 
does not work with newer eTrex GPS units 
Works well with a few reservations 
Bad tolerances 
Useful for protecting your GPS but not that great 
Snug Fit nice protection 
OK but nothing special 
Garmin eTrex case is a nice neoprene case providing a little protection for any eTrex handheld GPS 
ok but... 
Offers protection if you can deal with glare and bulk 
not a hiker 
Quality Case But Difficult to See-Through 
eTrex Case 
Okay case 
You don't need it 
It is a Crazy World 
good but a little unpredictable 
Nice and smooth but... 
Solid and stylish but a bit uncomfortable 
Good if cheap--otherwise look elsewhere 
Just average 
Too narrow to be comfortable unless you have small hands. 
hmmmm 
Only Okay 
Seems to work okay 
Not what I expected 
Not what I was looking for 
Was good 
Not the quality I had hoped for... 
Works pretty good but kind of unsticks a little 
Be careful of your paint 
As advertised.. 
Good but eh.... 
ITs what it says it is. 
The adhesive isn't what I expected 
Price is a putt-off 
Too Small For My Cables 
Does the job but with a few crucial flaws. 
Oops: almost useless to me 
Why can't Canon make this eycup to stay on? 
Not Bad 
does NOT fit 20D as advertised 
it's not excellent.. but it does the job.. usually 
Works well indoors / limited compatibility 
Works well but extremely LIMITED 
Cannot rate it yet 
Canon ST-E2 Speedlite transmitter 
Not Impressed... 
Decent but not entirely worth it. 
canon bag 1eg

Get a New Measuring Tape! 
Make Sure To Read Size Description 
Three Stars 
Didn't work for me -- just too bulky! 
Good quality - but small... 
Just OK 
Great bag but misleading tag 
It's just okay 
Not what I was looking for 
a dirt cheap bag that gets the job done 
Limited space despite what other reviews stated. 
Good bag but a bit small. 
works ok but  the build feels off 
Canon Speedlite not so speedy 
No bounce 
Doesn't work with the Canon 30D 
Canon Wireless IR Remote Remote Control for the Canon Digital Rebel remote control 
Don't drop it! 
Remote 
Ultra portable fairly simple but limited applications. 
It really is wireless but... 
Not worth the money 
Perfect for \With-Me\ Shots 
OK. 
Simple to use but limited utility 
Great in front not for behind 
Canon Remote 
Doesn't work if you're behind the camera 
Nice switch. 
Works sometimes 
Canon Remote Switch RS60 E3 
Works as expected. 
Only works with SOME Canon EOS models 
Doesn't Do Anything with Video Mode with an SX-50 
Is Adequate But Suffers From Flaws 
Quality excellent; functionality limited/disappointing 
What you would expect 
wish the cord was longer. 
Good quality...but 
THE CORD IS TOO SHORT 
It works fine but... 
Typical Canon - over priced accessory. 
money for nothing chicks for free...so goes the song 
Did not last long. 
Not quite what I wanted 
buy an intervalometer 
Decent leather but does make M100 bulky 
Over-priced! However... 
Caution for M100 owners! 
Getting better 
Still Buggy After All This Time 
Does the job but.... 
Preview of what is to come 
nice unit but wireless is expensive and slow 
Cheap and OK for light duty work. 
Weak better quality at Box stores

Breaks easily. 
Serve the purpose 
Watch the price 
MADE IN CHINA 
A fun toy at a much lower price. 
Not customized for the G10

Functional but quality a bit disappointing for the price 
Good but not great 
A little bit smaller than I'd expected 
It's good but not perfect 
Comes Close To Being The Best 
WARNING: MP3 file transfer is one direction only 
Flawed But Cool Anyway 
In a class by itself with one major problem. 
Battery Hog 
Canon EF 100MM f/2.8 Macro USM Lens - No \IS\ 
compromise 
Good for the money 
Great value for price; some caveats on performance 
Not bad but not great (like the 28-135mm) 
Picture quality not bad but far too slow. 
Canon EF 75-300 
Update on previous review 
3 1/2  Please Read This  If Driver Problem for Linksys 200 
the ATP3: they look cool but produce average sound 
OK 
Monster Cable Standard 
Fine speaker wire not as easily hidden as I had hoped 
Not \superflat\ 
Great product...if you can find it cheap 
A decent unit 
works great but... 
Why? 
Buy a Palm 
An interesting products that needs some bugs ironed out 
Nice gear 
Decent camera for the price 
JamCam + Windows XP = NIGHTMARE! 
A Disposable Digital Camera 
The blue version's review may be helpful 
Okay for limited duty. 
It's better than I expected for the price 
MMC card readers DO NOT work with this camera! 
Good Price Okay Headphones 
acceptable sound in a comfortable headset 
Pricey but necessary! 
Casio E-125--  a super product badly documented 
Awesome product but one very big flaw! 
Excellent Hardware.......software leaves a lot to be desired 
oh Toshiba! 
Good for what it does bad for what it doesn't 
Too Big Too Expensive 
Good Overall Lens 
Good Zoom Range for a Walk Around Lens 
Satisfactory but not more 
The pads KEEP falling out ALL the TIME 
OK ear bud but prefer Koss 
Average Headphones 
Nothing special 
Not For The Typical Audiophile... 
Best cheap earbud but not stereophile 
OK but not great 
OK for the money 
Was expecting better from Sennheiser! 
so so 
Good sound poor details ... 
Good sound quality but lacks Bass 
Terribly Uncomfortable 
Review for: Sennheiser MX500 Lightweight In-Ear Headphone (Blue) with Carrying Case 
Compared to other earbuds for the price these compete well. 
10 feet at best. Better to get a straight cable. 
Works well but heavy...pulls on headphones 
Not really 20 Useful Ft 
Headphone Cord. 
Good for listening to music not for microphone use 
No 1/4\ to 1/8\ adapter. 
Alright 
Easy to use cable but complicated process. 
Worked for the first 6 months I used it 
I need both hands 
The cheapest looking wrist strap ever 
Uncomfortable 
Holds firm! 
Suitable 
So so 
does the job 
flimsy 
Still don't know how this works 
best computer investment tool you can have 
I guess it works 
Works but... 
Good price don't like the design of the snagless ends 
Belkin A3L791 
Good product 
Not USB 3 
It does clean 
Works ok....doesnt last 
Hey it is a cord 
Yawn.  Essential if you need it however. 
Beware 
Good quality but not Ethernet 
Probably overkill... 
good quality cable - just don't try to pull it out. 
Modem cable 
Ordered 3 cables at one time 
Flip Flop 
Works no frills same cable different brand 
Good cables

It works 
okay 
cable is a cable good for the price 
Seems to work 
Not white but got what I paid for

Just OK. Works. Not Snagless!  Get \Snagless Boot\ Type! 
Make sure you know it is an Extension cable Not a Replacement cable 
Good finish works fine 
Not really what I was lookin for but nevertheless a useful item. 
Good value 
Fine for your old Polaroid but kind of overpriced 
It's a cable for god's sake... 
Better than your printer's reader 
Belkin Cables Are Of Expected Quality 
Inexpensive hub for non-powered devices 
Lasted about a year couldn't use all ports. 
So So hope it at least works 
It serves its purpose 
A decent assembly of tools. 
Fairly decent toolkit 
great multi purpose not the best for computers 
Functional with one problem. 
Bad design no instructions 
Does ok seems reliable but annoyingly tips 
No size adjustment??? 
Really quiet but not built to last 
An okay toolkit 
Decent kit with a few caveats 
flimsy 
Items are of moderate quality and usefulness 
Good kit overall product quality needs improvement. 
well constructed but not usable with Vista 
Don't buy unless you have a headphone amp! 
Where Is The Treble? 
Like a suit of plate armor 
Very good sound quality but not comfortable for me. 
The good and the bad. 
Just so-so 
Would be 5 stars except..... 
It does work but not much excitement 
NOT A TRUE APC BATTERY - Misleading Image on SITE!!! 
works wish price was cheaper 
Cable is good quality but packaging is mediocre. 
Not too thrilled with this one! 
Good monitor...if it works 
It flashes after 6 month 
I had to return mine :( 
Received Used Filter? 
OK filter 
so so 
Vignetting on Tamron 17-50mm 
Capable of helping both create and mess up good shots 
Filter threads do work with Canon lens caps 
Affordable but... 
Works as advertised 
As expected for Tiffen 
Too thin and doesn't seem to be doing its job very well 
Vignetting a major problem 
lens needs cleanin before use 
Make Shure you know your ambient lighting 
Tiffen do I love thee? 
Gets The Job Done Does Not Come in Perfect Condition 
Nice polarizer 
Fits but Dirty 
Mixed results 
Learn about the ND filters before you buy one.

Gets The Job Done Does Not Come in Perfect Condition 
Ok at the very best. 
Works well 
Not strong enough 
A good filter for daylight landscapes..but not this particular filter. 
Fine but not coated... 
It flares 
Consider its limitations before buying! 
Easy To Use Causes Some Vignetting 
have reservations 
Better in theory than practice. 
Decent quality graduated neutral density filter 
Filter performs ok 
Does what its intended 
Not very useful 
I think I need one of these... 
This is an average product 
expensive for Tiffen glass

Lots of distortion 
It's OK 
it's ok... 
Great Filter But It May Not Fit 
OK... 
Experience with the 37mm filter on my Olympus M.Zuiko 17mm F2.8 lens 
If You Are Under Budget Constraints 
Works for protection 
UV Filter for lens protection 
Good Backup UV Protection 
TIFFEN 37mm UV Protector Filter 
Good lens protector 
Protect your lens but... 
Works great to protect the lens from damage! 
ok filter without coating 
Does one job well but botches another 
Not sure if it was me or the lens. 
Protects your glass but shows some ghosting! 
Not multi-coated but does a job 
Adequate & functional but disappointing. 
May be great product but slow delivery is annoying 
Not multi-coated.... not worth it

Inexpensive protection for expensive lenses. 
Fair for the money 
So-so 
Tiffen 37 mm filter 
lens flare a problem 
Not bad but if you're an enthusiast get Hoya or B+W. 
Simple effective prone-to-flare! 
May cause more glair 
Uv filter that causes lens flares and double images

Good but produces unwanted glare 
lens uv 
*Beware the Flare* 
Good option for a UV filter 
Needed it right away! 
Does the job 
Protection Filter 
It protects my lens 
This is what you get 
A little loose 
A UV filter is a UV filter. 
It's a middle-of-the-road UV filter 
Not necessary for today's lenses. Can help for lens scratching but they can cause sun flair. 
OK but wrong size. 
Loose retaining ring 
Nice filter questionable frame 
well....... 
Alright 
it is what it is 
Works affordable not mulit-coated 
bought only for cover protection my EF lens 
Alright item 
It's a nice UV filter but... 
Works With Olympus E-P1 14-42 Kit Lens 
Far from perfect 
It protects the lens 
Protects against dust & scratches but not against flare 
Good basic lens protector 
You get what you pay for 
Better UV Filters Out There 
Not so great 
Easily scratched 
Works mostly get some ghosting sometimes 
Cheap but it works 
Good for protection .. not so much for ghosting 
The loudest part on my camera 
Its ok 
Mostly Useless 
Good. 
Fine product great value but too thick to stack with others 
Filter works OK 
It's a piece of glass 
Good for the price 
Work fine. 
Good quality but poor results 
Tiffen 58mm UV Protection Filter 
For the price it is what it is. 
You Get What You Pay For 
As expected for Tiffen 
It's good but one problem... 
It works 
Perfectly fine for the cost. Be aware its uncoated 
Review of the TIffen UV Filters vs the B+W

You get what you pay for 
Did not fit Nikon Lens 
Yeah they are OK - rookie's 2 cents 
AMAZON sent me a defective one 
Good protection for lens but horrible for photography. 
Average 
Ordered with my new Nikon D5200 camera. 
What can you say about a filter ?? 
A Decent First Filter 
Cheap filter protects your lens detracts from your photos 
UV protection not so great 
OK filter for protection 
Cheap and does what I need 
Good for multipurpose zoom lens and not for Telezoom 
Decent filter mine had a flaw in it though. 
Just so so 
does its job 
Good clear glass filter for lens protection 
not bad 
Hmmmm... 
Let me begin by saying the quality of the filters seems to be very good. 
Do as advertised but I'm not impressed by the quality 
Is it the Manufacturer or Seller? 
Useful for beginners 
Blue dye coming off Circular Polarizer 
To filter or not to filter is really the question 
No Adapter Ring Included No UV Multi-coating 
You get what you pay for. 
Work well 
a little small -  requires patience 
Not Great but Works 
Won't work with some control setups 
Can't access controls with grip in place - Lumix G 
Not the best fit on a Nikon D5300

They are great for the price BUT be sure you get the one in this photo 
Wonderful lens for learners 
Excellent photo quality - AF not compatible for D3000 
Great lens at an affordable price amateur oriented! 
Tamron AF 28 - 80 mm f3.5-5.6

Good filter on a budget. 
Decent quality but a bit out dated now.

It is what it is 
Right for a light.... 
Better than the big plastic cases .... 
Limited compatibility 
Excellent features but is it reliable? 
Nice but I wish the screw terminals were not there 
this is a gender-changer not a null modem converter 
Works 
OK 
works fine looks like it was made in 1995 
NOT Rack Mountable 
Should have a better means to hold in place. 
May or may not get wall mount hardware

An entertaining - but unessential  - concert film 
Too Bad it Wasn't Better 
Good but dark 
Great singers in a static production 
Decent but Mostly a Repeat of Riley's Books 
This Movie Has What It Takes! 
Cute 
Concert not a Music Video 
I Feel Guilty Giving It Less Than 5 Stars But... 
Boarding-school japes in France! 
Not the most useful video for potty training 
Potty Training

Pass on this and wait hopefully for the DVD of Anderson/Pavarotti 
An embarassment of...embarassments 
Carol Neblett looks Horrible but Sings Beautifully 
An Interesting Second La Fanciulla 
Eh..... 
Misfortune of virtue again. 
Handel vs. Sellars 
A voice teacher and early music fan 
To err is Sellars although the singing is divine... 
an excellent film poor print. wait until late 2004 to buy 
Good 
Should have been better! 
STOMP 
Less than expected 
Not for operatic fans. 
It's not really all that bad. 
Nice try

Wasn't what I thought it was 
Full screen  Not  Widescreen

too short and too long.... 
An odd experience -- 
I love Woodstock but . . . 
Ultimate Collector's Edition not worth the added expense 
Either the end or the beginning of a dream... 
Less Would Be More 
Da Woodstock Nation Whatever..... 
Woodstock - Blu-ray Info

Conservative performance lacklustre video production 
Classical Music on DVD - like CD's twenty years ago! 
THIS GUY THINKS HE'S BIGGER THAN BEETHOVEN!!!!!  Not! 
Not the best one from Karajan! 
Interesting 
Excellent performance poor video 
Could be better 
A cute video but Elmo doesn't appear much! 
Pleasant but be forewarned: this is about Sesame Street NOT Elmo! 
Wasn't he always unplugged? 
Love Tony but... 
WHERES THE COMPLETE FOOTAGE? 
Where is the rest of the concert? 
The music too-often takes a back seat to the promoters. 
Great Festival Bad Film 
Good concert footage -- but its a rocumentary first 
the last the largest it could be better 
Controversy? Yes... Music? Not enough 
A True picture of the love and peace era.

JOHN DENVER: THE WILDLIFE CONCERT 
Sound Quality 
Disappointed 
Get God Is In The Tv Instead 
Dead to the Viewer 
Marilyn Manson is NOT a normal person 
It's okay 
Great Movie - Mixed Feelings on this edition 
For TON fans but probably not for vampire/movie buffs 
ok 
odd  new Lou Reed.c.d. 
Blondie are doing it for themselves 
Fancy that fancy this. 
Foot at an angle 
Good CD 
Pretty much what you would expect 
This Won't Last 
Its OK but nothing special  with nothing resembling VH 
That's a little more like it..... 
Pitch-correction and mediocre songs - still better than most. 
Not as good as the first one! 
Alright Alright 
Nice Try 
Van Halen rejects don't add up to Van Halen 
Its Slash... 
its ok  not great the singer sounds the same on every song! 
To Be Honest... 
Decent enough follow-up to a brilliant debut 
not my favorite 
a decent album from slash 
Not up to the last Slash album 
Decent Album 
Good album 
Probably my Least Favorite Rush Album 
PLEASE remaster this fine record!! 
After 5 Years of Waiting a Big Disappointment 
It is another Rush Jam Album 
...they just keep powering on - more power to em' 
Starts strong a little repetitive in the middle an uplifting end and a nicely illustrated digital booklet 
Bring back Terry Brown! 
No philosophy consoles me in a clockwork universe. 
Oh if only Terry Brown could get his fingers on this sonic mess 
louder-Louder-LOUDER!!!!! 
Some good songs but mostly ordinary and repetitive 
It is fair to criticize 
Poor mixing/mastering damaged one of their better albums 
Dissapointed a bit 
Not a favorite but not a skeet target either. 
An ambitious work marred by suffocating homogenizing production 
Hmm.... 
I was so ready to love this but... 
They Tried Too Hard 
Geddy Lee just doesnt have it together anymore... Vocal - wise. 
Five stars? Really? Please be sincere! 
SOME GOOD MOMENTS..... 
They are no angels but work like a clock 
Concept lost. This ain't no Hemispheres 
Hmmm! 
A challenging listen..... 
Time to dump Nick Raskulinecz 
I love this album and the new Lovari album 
sick of digital 
Great by today's standards but not one of Rush's best 
Great Rush album damaged by what sounds like poor mastering 
Meh... 
I expected more but it's ok 
Hope Is What Remains to be Seen 
disappointed

Not a bad start for an up-and-coming band 
Good singer- okay music 
A Strong Debut 
Not as good as there EP 
OK With Some Bright Spots 
Well... After Reading All The Reviews... 
Skillet is alright but not the most solid album ever 
More like two and a half but I'm being nice.... 
Just can't beat Collide this time.. 
I really wanted this album to be as good as Arriving but: 
Progressive Rock with a Heavy Edge 
6.5/10 
Not as good as I remembered 
Reminiscences gone astray 
Not Bad for a White Boy! 
Radical Changes 
too harsh for my taste 
I'll rate it 3 stars for now!! 
WRONGHEADED...This is so greatly BAD 
When questionable intentions go wrong-You have to hear this!!! 
3 stars for being hilarious; 0 for musical talent 
It is what it is 
Total is significantly less than the sum of the parts 
Admirable - As \Swan Lake\ Goes. . . 
I recommend the DVD of the Swedish Ballet as First Choice 
Sing it&#8230; 
Laziness to release this on DVD speaks volumes 
Three and-a-half really. Good but not as good as 'Tales from Margaritavision'. But get both while you can! 
Much more available footage that wasn't given to us.... 
There's nothing like a Grateful Dead concert... 
Mostly unobjectionable 
WHAT?!!  No bonus features?! 
Vintage clips are great - the rest is well.... 
Exposed 
Decent video but had most on other KISS DVDs

Mixed feelings 
Nice visual effects even if it gets boring at times!!! 
Unintentionally Hilarious! 
Dancing Days are hear again! 
Remastering is Great Bonus DVD is Great...but the PACKAGING SUCKS! 
It's unfortunate that this is all we have... 
It's a concert  \CLIP\ 
Not bad at the time 
Great music but. . . 
Good for Zep fanatics. Loses its charm for others. 
Heavily edited 
Better off with the 2003 set 
Led Zeppelin 
Led Zeppelin: The Song Remains The Same - Blu-ray Info 
Not Zeppelin at their best but still good...

I Agree that it Could Have Been Done Better... 
DIO rocks with Sabbath! 
I'd like to say this movie was great but..... 
Inaccurate but highly entertaining and bizarre film best taken as a cult curiosity.  Mediocre DVD treatment though 
A punk classic...you might as well see it.

Good show but can we get a more current one? 
could be better 
Good except for Tannhauser himself 
Well almost.... 
It Grows On You 
ok onli 
Well-crafted but can be quickly tiring 
By far their worst. 
Not as great as it should have been 
Who are we kidding?!! 
20 years later not much has changed 
Not essential but very solid Steely Dan 
Not like the first ones 
Jazz Funkelastic White Boys still Rock! 
Great concept disappointingly executed 
Two Against ...any interest at all. 
Fine CD...But Lacks Great Songs 
babylon brothers 
Steely Dan needs rhythm energy 
Reeling in the Years......... 
Middle of the Road..... 
Yeah the 70's are over but the albums endure 
Way Deep Into Nothing Special 
This is just good enough to buy 
Good Concert  With Engineering Mishap

Pretty Good until She fades 
DTS with no center channel 
Great production cast despite vocal problems of Pendatchanska 
Feelin' so good or not? 
A bit boring in the beginning 
Solid Performance but Disc Exhibits Playback Problems 
Il manque Wakeman! 
psssss 
A brave set full of new songs 
Great visuals but where's the bass? 
You don't really need it 
One new episode doesn't quailfy for a new tape 
end summer revisit 
Misunderstood but not the masterpiece it's made out to be... 
A man is born lives and dies 
The Wall 
To much of roger waters is not a good thing 
An overrated album.... 
WARNING-NO YOUNG LUST! 
A flawed but compelling look at rock stardom 
the most overrated pf album 
The deal's been made.... 
You missed the point. 
Good concept suffers from band loss 
Slick bombastic -- but not a lot of substance 
Definitely a mixed bag 
Does not require buy-in. 
Waters dominated effort hurtling toward a dark and dreary place 
This review is just Another Brick In The Wall... 
Over-rated and unremarkable 
Is it the best or worst Pink Floyd? 
Too much \concept\ not enough \album\. 
I'll go on record and say this.. 
Uneven Wildlly Overrated 
Dissapointing 
Only a few good bricks... 
you have to be in the mood 
Don't  believe the fans...... 
Uncomfortably Numb 
The Wanking Wall 
This is not Pink Floyd!! 
Not as good as original 
The ultimate High School Album and Skating Song 
Average Pink Floyd (3 and a half stars) 
The Wall 
Overrated and self-indulgent 
Overrated 
One of Floyd's Most Popular (and Annoying) Albums 
Overrated but very good... 
Excellent album but constantly blown out of porportion 
Commercial success - Ego inflation - Loss of Floyd sound. 
Heating Up Christian Rock 
Get the cd The book is an acquired taste I suppose. 
Actually I give it 2 and 1/2 stars 
Lovely but can get a bit monotonous 
Melodically Interesting Sonically Dated 
Yanni mix 
A paradoxical bump in the rapid slide into mediocrity. 
Going... going....nearly gone! 
Not my favorite but still good 
Life After Love 
Quarter collaboration 
A Mediocre Effort 
Latte Music 
Is this a new take on Melrose or simply a re-release on another label? 
Good yes.  Great no. 
DISAPPOINTING 
Very Lovely A Little Morose 
What the Hell? 
Not Her Best 
Good Not Great 
\Dare to Dream\- Yanni 
Good Not Great 
A few fun numbers for fans. 
Same old schmaltz 
A gratifying compilation 
not Etta at her best but good if you are an Etta James fan 
Expectation Much Greater Than Reality 
I've Tried Oh How I've tried

5 Stars for The Pokrovsky Singers/2 for Paul Winter 
A Good album 
\Can I stroke you up!\ 
Keep it slow ladies... 
The Kingz of Rock 
If It Ain't Broke... 
Not as tight as their first album 
Great voice that needs to be washed with soap 
Hard Core by Lil Kim (*Back in the Day Series*) 
Sorry y'all I just wasn't feeling it 
Lil' Kim?????? 
Is this the same woman who made Notorious K.I.M & LBM? 
One of the top modern female rappers 
Too much Kim!! 
Decent effort from DJ Pooh 
It's Ok 
Lightning in a bottle (3.5/5) 
Crush on you was my  cut 
3 and 1/2 star effort--aged well in some spots not in others 
PALE BY COMPARISON 
A Great Single A Wonderful First Album but... 
Two-fer of mid-60s UK vocal group's albums + bonus cuts 
Good quality sound but not up to par 
hard to find music 
the well is running dry 
Budgie's 2nd phase 
Okay... 
What's Good Is Cherce But.... 
Mixed deck 
Wouldn't pay too much for it 
Mid '70's return 
Best be your own judge 
It grows on you... 
A good start -- but only a start 
Uneven often strange with blasts of brilliance 
ian 
Amon Duul - 'Psychedelic Underground' (Repertoire) 3 1/2 stars 
Sehr seltsamer Sound 
This is a different band then Amon Duul 2 
Renaissance goes pop! 
Solid Solo Outing 
High Schmaltz 
Roger Daltrey - 'Daltrey' (Repertoire) 
Not the correct Procol harem format I wanted-my error 
cream of the crop 
For the Better Moments Worth the Price 
While the live portion captures the band's proficiency for long jams this is not up to the standard of the album before 
Thunder 
A great single CD's worth of material stretched to 2 CDs 
Disappointed withthe sound quality. 
They Hadn't Quite Figured Out How to Record Loud Bands Yet 
creams wheels of fire still burn somewhat! 
This is not what Cream deserves to be remembered for 
Fresh Cream 
Blues and bluesy rock'n'roll debut not their finest. 65/100 
good 
Just a dollop of Cream at their freshest!! 
Decent...Not a classic 
A Crazy Sound from a Crazy Band 
Okay 
It's just okay 
Convenient but boring 
Good for professional and school use 
Good Gel Wrist Rest 
Basic mouse pad no frills. 
Worth the price 
Works as it should 
So-so mouse pad 
Ink is Ink or Is It? 
Not Canon packaging 
Decent features for the price but gets expensive in the long run 
They are normal pens 
it's a note book 
Decent 
It works 
You get what you pay for 
Ok if you must have a pad for your mouse... 
Basic mouse pad perfect for basic use. 
Great price but for a few dollars more you can get better quality. 
Small size limits versatility 
Called 5267 labels but use template 5167 to print 
address return labels 
Being the devil's advocate 
OK but not perfect 
Great small quirks 
it works to keep my wrists elevated 
Trublock Technology 
Printer Problems 
Labels are fine. Instructions are slightly confusing 
still waiting for order... 
Love Dymo Labels! 
Fine labels mediocre software. 
Does what it's supposed to do 
Not really clear for fancy wedding envelopes closer to frosted 
Avery Easy Peel  Clear Address Labels 
Very cheapWorks well 
Good Mouse Pad 
You get what you pay for 
These became cheaper than the blue ones for now 
Great tape but much less quantity than you think. 
Five stars for product two stars for value and description of this particular item 
Great high quality tape. Lousy cutting bar. 
Tape is Tape 
Does the job

Epson  2200 Review 
Not the End-all Be-all Solution 
Functional....but pricey 
Undersize 
Good product nice price 
Good once it's in.  Can be messy to install due to printer. 
Requires special headset 
Sturdy and does its job well but takes up quite a bit of space 
Good idea; perhaps not good value. Challenges in use but broader applications than billed. 
Seems poor for the price 
Expected better ... at the MSRP 
Just OK 
Overpriced and probably overkill for most uses 
Too large and the elastic string that holds the pages down is flimsy 
Functional If A Little Unwieldy and Cumbersome 
Nice but some major flaws 
Multi-purpose holder 
Very good for large books 
Keyboard Cleaning Kit 
ok..but not great 
Avery Easy Peel Mailing Labels 
Avery White Shipping Labels: LASER PRINTERS 
Not Practical For Smaller Projects 
Handy but Not Necessary 
Great product but now \the rest of the story\ 
Five Sets of thin white dividers and invisible peelable strips for easy customizing. 
I really want to like it - but this stand falls short 
A useful stand for taking notes on what you're reading 
Well made but not for thick books. 
A flaw to consider before buying 
Adequate bookstand 
Not very strong 
Works ok... 
thin 
It smells 
Mouse pad 
It is a mouse pad. 
Works Great But Smells Bad 
Does what it's supposed to do. 
It's oil. It lubricates but... 
Just OK 
Its oil.  It works the way oil should. 
One caveat 
Does it's job but a bit messy 
Good Price Works Well but Poorly Designed Bottle that Leaks 
Hmmmmmm 
The product itself is okay but figuring out how to open the bottle was a little tricky 
This really is just vegetable oil 
Gets the job done - that's about all it does 
Okay 
Large tray 
Works. 
Cuts very well.  Rulers not precise 
Great Feel When Cutting! 
Will it last? 
Decent cheap trimmer. 
Not Always Even Cut. But it is a decent Device 
going back to my old trimmer 
I Prefer the Rolling Cutters 
Cuts well but not the one to get if you need accuracy 
Look at the photo not the specs 
really little 
Lightweight & efficient 
Good for Drafts and Emergencies 
Avery Two-Side Printable Clean Edge Business Cards for Inkjet Printers... 
Clean Edges... good appearance... but... 
Lots of fun but not practical 
What price a clean edge? 
They do the job 
Online Support for Macs lacking 
Began to rip after one semester 
their dividers what are you expecting 
its Tape 
This works and it doesn't. 
solidly built file storage box with some limitations. 
good boxes 
Okay but not a great value IMO 
Exactly what I ordered. 
Box is great! Lids are horrible. 
About these sheet protectors... 
Three Stars 
office products 
FLIMSY 
Good 
not the highest quality design 
A passable product with a flimsy flap 
A useful expanding file 
Flexible File Folder 
A decent if temporary solution 
Good Except for the Flap 
Utilitarian but so dark 
Flap too flimsy and easily bent 
Flimsy Flap 
Okay for Temporary Filining Needs 
sturdy 
Basic 
It's okay if you don't intend to over-fill it or open the flimsy flap umpteen times a day! 
Functional but flap is disappointing 
These are average 
Good 
These Wilson Jones Insertablet 8 Tab Dividers are for lightweight organizing but the price is right! 
Decent tab dividers but not particularly durable ... 
Nothing special 
Perfectedly Ordinary Tab Dividers 
For Occasional Use 
They work but are flimsy and cheap. 
Cheap and imperfect but they do separate pages 
Pretty Standard 
Not much to say...it fills the bill 
Just the basics 
Fine for light use but not for everyday heavy use. 
Mixed results 
Plastic dividers are just not as good as paper. 
Great idea - damaged in production 
They seemed fine 
Not very comfortable to sit on for very long 
It's so hard to sit on! 
Not for fixed-height chairs 
Mead Composition Books NOT What They Used To Be! 
Bargus 
Exactly as You Remember ... 
Paper is a little thin 
Good but marker has slight bleed 
Bridget's Review 
Not your ordinary pens. 
Ink is too light 
THis pen has a removal top.....Julia 
Not my favorite ink pen but does the job 
Consistency is \iffy\ 
okay 
I Was Hoping For a Better Quality! 
I Do Not Like Gel Pens 
The point section is a bit \tall\ for my hand 
My wife loves it. 
Much more comfortable grip but the clip is easily bent 
YOU have to mount this one for effective sharpening 
It's nice  but construction is pretty cheap 
Better than the Boston KS 
Underwhelmed 
Almost as good 
Works But Inconsistently 
Finicky at best 
Good heavy duty electric pencil sharpener! 
extremely wasteful 
Bright for a while 
Not the best 
extremely wasteful 
Cool 
new ones not for books 
well 
I find the smaller tip version which is retractable better. Added the URL below for your consideration 
the new ones can't highlight books 
From Pocket to Paper Pocket Accent Gets the Job Done 
SHARPIE ACCENT POCKET-STYLE HIGHLITERS FLUORESCENT YELLOW 
They are okay 
Decent but not as strong as the \reinforced\ name implies 
One Drawback 
Not my favorite 
Average 
OK folders but you really need a 2-hole punch 
a little flimsy 
not very sturdy 
Liked the organizational features but not as sturdy as I'd like... 
NICE COLORS GOOD QUALITY. 
Good Tape - Overpriced 
The cost is a bit much 
Clear packing tape works just as well 
Doesn't stick very well 
Tape is good price is bad. 
works for painting pinning & organizing 
Not Bad for Non-Painted Surfaces but Way Too Expensive Comparing to Blue Tape 
It's ok... 
High quality but very expensive 
DIY 
too wide 
Okay but the BIC version is better 
Not sure about this 
First Half Works Well 
It is white out what more could you expect? 
Not perfect 
Not easy to get started 
Correction Tape 
Some Mistakes Can't be Erased... 
Disappointing 
It's an index card 
ok but not fine point 
Streets of Fire 
ehhh 
These are good but... 
Liquid Flair Pens 
Short on Ink 
They're ok 
A little too fine 
Too fat for normal use 
They don't last... 
it works 
It's changed... 
Nothing to really distiguish this from other similar priced units 
pretty good stapler 
just your basic stapler 
Underwhelming 
It staples and it is full-sized 
The School Standard 
Good but look cheap 
Worked for a While 
Average but inexpensive 
OK but not really used very much 
Good For When You Need To Staple Stuff 
It's OK for the price wish it came in white! 
There are better options that can do 20 sheets with the same staples. 
It's okay 
A Staple 
Pretty cheap 
Depends on Much Stapling You Will Be Doing 
Nice to have for extra stapler! 
It does work 
Doesn't stay shut. 
It works but the shape is stupid 
Classic pen but not great option for long term writing 
I have Older Version 
Not-Too-Sticky Small Notes 
They are hard to get off the board 
little 
copy paper okay 
Not exactly what I was expecting. 
Good quality for projects only fair for photo reproduction 
So-So... 
Is it just my saliva? 
Doesn't seal well 
They work 
Why not scored into quarters? 
Word presets work fine but having problems with clipart and images 
Stylish label for specific printing jobs but prone to smudges 
Very nice looking labels but tricky to use 
Adds a nice accent 
Labels don't work as well as expected; not for black-ink printers 
Disappointed 
Good tape does what it's supposed to bad dispenser 
It sure is super strength and they ain't fooling around! 
Super strong tape horrible dispenser! 
Think of it as heavy-duty office tape 
OK for medium duty work 
I wouldn't buy again 
OK BUT 
Interesting idea imperfect implementation 
Good product with a few new innovations 
Removable If You Don't Mind Working At It 
Good Labels 
Serve their purpose !! 
Columbian CO128 (#10) 4-1/8x9-1/2-Inch Security Tinted White Envelopes

good labels 
The Classic Office Space Stapler 
The Famous Red Stapler 
RED ALERT: Good stapler but not indestructible. 
what's NOT to love? 
First layer of bands broke but ok after that 
Inconsistent quality 
clever and convenient way to store and access rubber bands at home or in office 
Feels cheap. 
Not For Me 
Not very comfortable but built well 
Heavy over-kill for a footrest 
Eh... ok but not recommended 
Excellent construction -- SHARP EDGES 
This brings back some bad memories... 
They're the tiny ones 
Poor Choice 
Decent binder loose plastic back 
Unimpressive 
Average binder 
Standard three ring binder with all the basic drawbacks. 
white 1 1/2 inch round 3 ring binder at this time 3.99 shipped a good price. 
Not the best binder I've used... 
Eco-friendly view binder is otherwise ordinary 
Standard Binder 
A Basic Round Ring Binder But The Covering Is Too Loose 
Expensive for a basic binder 
Should work well enough for me. 
Seriously? $9 for this? Not all that impressive. 
Does the job but needs some work. 
Almost made it through a semester... 
Basic 1 1/2 inch binder. 
Board Awesome Hangars and Accessories Not So Much 
I suggest 3 changes 
Decent 
Three Stars 
At least the tape stays where it should. 
OK ONLY... Dispenser 
It's okay but the At-A-Glance products are much better 
Good Style But A Little Off 
Large Thin paper. 
Better products exist but this looks nice 
Wide-Ruled? Is this business notes for third graders? 
Nice Page Layout --But Low Quality Paper 
Functionality depends on how you plan to use it and the type of writing instrument you use 
it's okay and pretty generic 
Well.... 
not worth the extra expense to me 
good product 
Pretty close to perfect but... 
Great printer but I don't understand the price. 
Great Idea Hard To Use! 
One big sticker gives lots of freedom to design but a little unwieldy to shape 
An Oaky Budget Option but Print Quality Suffers 
BEWARE - This is a \Compatible\ product 
As advertised 
OK Little Printer 
Compared to what? 
Good value. 
As expected but that clear. 
Ony 5 cartridges not 6 
It is EVERYDAY paper after all 
pretty picture 
They protect but feel flimsy and cheap 
Lightweigt... 
Ugly Fellowes Plastic Bags 
Good ink at too high a price 
OK Phones but There are Better 
Nice battery hog 
Perfect after some super glue! 
Uniden 8866's area code problem easily solved and other comments 
It works.  Tape gets stuck on the blade. 
Great printer for printing photos and type 
After around 1000 sheets the cyan nozzle died... read on. 
Reasonable Printer 
5 colors (5 folders of each color) 
These Are Not the Files You Are Looking For Obi Wan

Cart 
Cheap Price Cheap Quality 
Mine would not continue to write... 
Good pen 
Mine leaked... 
Good writing quality but barrel cracked after 4 months 
Nib Too Fine 
A negative experience 
Outstanding For Light Use  - High Per Page Cost For Ink 
Fine Nib ink flow not so great 
Works but not great 
A Diamond Set in Cheap Plastic 
Washable eradicable blue ink. 
It did what it was supposed to. 
A Good Product but a Bad Idea. 
Will work more or less-depending on your phone 
Well-constructed but has limited usefulness 
For the right job it'll do... 
Fair But Not Quite What I'd Hoped For 
That Lack of Top Flap Is Not Actually A Good Thing... 
Not bad 
cardboard expanding file 
Ordinary stapler 
Not as Heavy Duty Given the Special Staples Needed 
Unfortunately they don't make them like they used to. 
Good but not what it used to be 
Well the binders are...ok....but empty-- and the alphabetical indexes provided only have the letter \W\ on them. 
Bought by mistake 
Does it's job but not very solid 
Good while it lasted 
Fast quiet but very small and shallow cup 
No frills sturdy sharpener for the deep pocketed and two-armed. 
Under Performing & Laughably Small Shavings Cup 
Not as good as my old identical Boston - but it will work. 
Works fine for home or office use 
Removes Staples But It's Nothing Really New 
New Staple Tool from Prylex (tm)

Sort of useful 
Good Tape for Packing and Sealing Boxes 
A special use tape not so useful for general purposes 
Great tape but price is too high 
Nice tape but too expensive 
A bit spendy for what it is 
Tough Tape High Price 
Pens barrel could be better 
Did they forget to design the body of this? 
Not exactly what I thought 
Not sure how to use it 
Minimal Uses 
Good quality and big but not very portable 
Not what I expected 
Handy organizer 
Just okay 
Sides are not enclosed.  Definitely mostly for desk use. 
Not the perfect sorting solution depending on your application 
Sticky Reel 
E-Z Turn  not so E-Z Open 
A medium duty binder. 
Disappointed... 
Great Price - 3 of 10 Delivered Were Bent 
Overpriced 
Binder Business 
It's a three ring binder 
it's a binder 
It's a notebook 
binder 
Very fine quality 
Does the job looks nice. 
Establishes proof of concept. Now needs more durable dispenser 
Not duck tape but a packaging tape. Price is on the high side though. 
The picture does not do it \justice\ 
Special purpose tape 
Not as good as I had hoped 
decent refill 
Fine for the price but not for high-quality technical drawing 
Small but useful 
Nothing to write home about 
Mine arrived dried out 
Choose Your Application Well 
Store them point down 
Great for the Kids not for Work 
Fair... the smaller the board the better! 
They're perfect for kids hands but not mine 
Nice markers erasers fall off 
Mixed bag! 
A decent set of markers 
Bright Colors but Not Well Made 
Convenient but... 
Everything you ever need wrapped up into one pen.  It's about time!! 
Good for the price; hang upside down to avoid drying out 
Very bright not always easy to erase 
I have bought 6 packages all with different ratings 
Would Like a Finer Point 
Magnets work fine but markers need to be pushed hard 
nice colors but lacking quality 
Clever idea - but lacked to execute 
Okay but not great 
Reasonably handy but thin line and magnets are not very strong. 
Not as opaque as expected 
Bought Once to Try 
Pens worked but  magnets failed 
Magnetic dry-erase markers - poor quality 
Small but Useful 
Unsure about these 
3.5* - Erasers are flimsy 
I wish someone would do this right /  2nd one failed now 
Fine for sending garbage for getting. 
\Carbon Paper\ results becaue it uses \carbon paper\. 
Not for academic use. 
sturdy to feel at hand 
Nice markers poor color matching 
Great palette but could last longer 
Shades a little surprising but a good set of several colors 
Double duty clamshell! 
many color way too light to write with 
Great printer with a few big flaws. 
Easy banner printing print quality is OK CD printing a pain 
OS X: had setup problems fixed in later releases. Has held up very well. 
Not bad 
Very comfortable but completely inadequate for shooting 
okay for other mild noises 
Decent low cost fax best for moderate use Its a fax 
Not top quality 
...Not my favorite. 
I am spoiled with Lamy fountain pens and if these had better ink I would rate the higher. 
Eh... 
Dependable ink flows too freely 
Gel Pens Baby 
Not Really Secure 
Not bad for single cutter sharpener 
Fragile and lopsided but quick 
Mine sharpens but doesn't stop... 
bargus 
Packaging makes it seem like you're getting more than you are. 
Tiny tape reels 
It's tape right? 
Ok if you need multiple dispensers 
underperformer 
good printer but noisy 
Bad Software but Excellent Hardware 
Good but not great 
Good tape but unreliable 
Duck this Tape 
small size = smaller toners 
Alright...not worth the $160 pricetag 
Replacement Ink 
Stand Out 
Not what I had hoped for 
Custom fit - not adjustable 
I really like it but I'm not sure I'd recommend it (strange eh?) 
It's Okay...claims to extend the mouse life. 
Effective but pricey 
Lots of nice features but not the most comfortable 
The primary value is in the rigid mouse pad and wrist pad surface 
works well but pricey 
For the price not exactly wonderful 
Not for me 
comfortable but not remarkable 
Far too limited for the price. 
Just okay--Repurposed 
Too expensive for what it does 
Adjustable - Once 
Does what it can do just not a full solution to my bad posture and achy hands 
Gel wrist guard is great but the platform has limited and fixed permanent choices for  calling it \adjustable \ 
Does what you expect 
Works well but runs out FAST 
As advertised but only purchase if you absolutely have to 
A mistake 
Canon printer always had stripes in solid areas. 
Always buying ink 
Problem with Borders 
Inconsisently says \out of paper\ and is an ink hog but good quality 
Minimally effective - does the job but has drawbacks 
Doesn't do all I needed 
Beautiful scans but weak flimsy plastic breaks too easily 
Just O.K. product. 
Good for the money 
Not As Expected. 
Would Not Buy Again 
Not especially practical. 
Half Sheet Labels 
Great Label But Thin Backing 
The Premium Choice In Labels For Shipping 
Trueblock? Yes. Permanent Adhesive? Maybe. 
Good quality but a bit expensive 
For the price not bad 
Too expensive

Quartet Dry Erase Markers 
Hard to erase

Just okay 
Umm..well.....ok...for $10 its fine....BUT........ 
Good markers 
Not Mac Compatible 
good value scanner and printer - UPDATE 11/12 for problems 
Great--but watch ink prices!!! 
Solid Printer. Flawed Mac Software; Lazy Developers. 
It's strong but sometimes hard to open 
It's doing the job but... 
Nice sized surface area 
Writes great... 
Handsome with nice ergonomics but they've got issues. 
Hit or miss 
Decent binder improvements needed in shipping 
Easy to use easy to store but check the quality before buying 
Well.... 
First Labeler 
Basic label printing 
I want to give it 5 stars... but I can't! 
Quality Has Gone Down 
Always Need Ink 
OK scale for what I paid but there is a problem. 
Ok but make sure you purchase the right thickness for your floor type 
Great pencil but with weaker design than GG 500 
Not bad but the 500 is half the price 
Good if you're looking for cheap box to storage your documents to have them one place and avoid mess... 
Damaged 
Not meant for heavier items. 
Worth the price 
hard to assemble 
Average 
Too Small! 
Meh.. 
Not exactly happy with these 
You do get what you pay for. Cheap bulk item with average quality 
ok at best 
Works somewhat 
Good choice for older child or occasional use 
If you don't get it just right you won't get a proper cut 
Works fine 
Adequate for a Tiny Occasional-Use Cutter 
You Get What You Pay For 
Great for scrap booking and photos

Neat new gadget 
It's okay. 
Very handy but refills are expensive 
Handy but limitation

Very handy dispenser - no pun intended 
Good concept poor execution

Could be better 
Good idea quickly gets used up

I could have used this handy dispenser years ago 
Not very cost effective 
Works great but just not necessary 
Good but... 
Great idea 
Why? 
Makes Life Easier for the Wrapping Impaired 
so-so 
Smooth sailing it is not. 
Sturdy

Got it 
It's OK could be better but is fine for casual use. Fair value.

Love mousing surface-hate vinyl covered wrist rest 
Best mousepad yet until it curled up 
So-so mouse pad 
Not Intended for the Large Handed 
The edges curl up 
Nice - But I Wish It Were Larger 
Seems like a nice item but not for me 
Comfortable and modern-looking. Good for today's office decor. 
just a couple flaws on this sturdy mouse pad/wrist rest combo 
too small to be useful 
Good but not Great 
Loved the idea but pens went dry fast... 
A good quality product at a reasonable price

Minimal privacy protection but sturdy. 
NOT QUITE AS ADVERTISED 
Not Really That Different 
Okay Not Great 
Good product but.. 
Mailings 
They're okay but not the most secure. 
NIFTY BUT FLAWED 
Lightweight privacy envelopes 
Secure Envelops 
Not really as described - they are ok envelopes - not tamper-revealing. 
Why pay extra for mediocrity 
Good for standard use but not for security 
Still doesn't beat the envelopes where users pull a strip to expose the adhesive... 
fine 
Nothing special 
LIke the Seal but This Envelope Still Reveals the Contents When Sealed 
An Ok Envelope Nothing Special 
Pushing the Envelope 
Where's The \Red\?

It works 
Looks cheap but good for childs room wall.

Can't get glue adhesive off 
Dry 
Weak magnets modifications required 
Quartet Dry Erase Board (8.5 x 11) 
Has A Problem Staying Put.. 
Weak Magnetic Backing 
Not durable but does the job 
Weak Mounting Magnets Otherwise Ok 
Nothing Special About This Dry-Erase Board

Good bookends do the job nothing extraordinary 
too small & light to be of much use 
Buy Cheap Get Cheap 
Range is good but long time battery life stinks 
AT&T Not What It Used To Be 
DECT 6.0 not as interference free as they claim 
Very good but many drawbacks! 
It works but........... 
Mixed feelings...

Significant issue makes it only 3 star worthy 
A lot for the money 
Not so sure after using for a while 
weird; super thin and not very sticky 
Nice - but could be better 
It's too small for my taste 
Warm and Bright 
Sticky Situation 
Laminate good times come on! (It's a lamination....) 
Fine for Certain Things 
Convenient but Too Thin. Inadequate Protection for Small Items Such As ID Cards. 
Works ok 
Easy to use but so-so presentation quality 
Not commercial grade product .... 
Plastic.  No tools assembly.  Good not great 
There's a reason this is less than $40 
Bought it for my classroom 
There must be a better way... 
strong chemical odor upon arrival.... 
Expected more from 3M 
Wish it was a bit softer. 
It's okay but... 
Firm Foam wrist rest...gel is better 
Sometimes bigger really is better 
If there is a difference I have yet to discover it 
Could stand to be wider 
Stick with gel 
Supportive But Some Downsides 
Great resting...horrible chemical scent 
A bit disappointed 
Battery consumption is an issue! 
A Good American-Made Binder But Expensive 
It works it's overpriced 
Price is a barrier. 
Hey...it's a binder and an expensive one at that. 
Too expensive for the lacking quality 
It's really nice but there are better options for much less money 
Misleading Information 
Liked the Big Tab not the folder 
Average product 
Very lightweight folders with a twist 
SuperTab? Not really. 
Helpful if you are using only these folders 
They're file folders nothing remarkable

Art Chalk 
Vibrant Colors Expensive Chalk 
Eleven Dollars for a Box of Chalk!!! 
Not as vibrant as hoped 
Nice Ink but Not the Color I Had Expected 
Expensive but does what it says 
Just another sharpener 
Loved it at first then it tanked 
New One: Still works great at 6mths - Old One: After a while only sharpened one side of pencil 
its ok just expensive 
Use a lot of photo paper.. 
A heavy-duty product I think best for office situations 
Very heavy duty some effort to install but works OK. 
You need to be handy! 
ink

Works but somewhat flimsy 
Functional especially for smaller hands

Very comfy but sometimes falls apart 
for very tall people who weigh less than 250 lb 
Easy Assembly. AMAZON SELLS FOR $79 
Just okay 
Some fit and finish issues

Looks great sounds great feels great BUT... 
Feature Stuffing! 
Great potential cut short by annoying flaws and design shortcomings. 
Pins are abit on the small side and the pink is not very vibrant 
Okay Printer Scanner Copier with not so good Fax and Sofware and Horrible Technical Support 
200 pages indeed! 
Better buy a few 
Good Bang for your $ ... But Misleading Rating... 
Good Price

Not The Longest Lasting Ink 
Decent printer.... 
An improvement but still some very irritating features. 
Not very comfortable 
Too Small 
Pretty and functional but not very comfortable.

Should be black 
Wish I could say it was a better printer 
BIG! 
Great concept but a little awkward 
Not Sure What I'll Use This For 
Lots of good features but not as expandable as it could/should be 
Has Its Uses But Not A Universal Storage And Organization Solution 
Nothing against this product but the price 
Good for backpacks but not for clipboards. 
Love the idea 
Good for keeping things contained 
Room for improvement 
3 1/2 Stars - Great Cork Portion But Some Construction Issues 
Board does not allow versatility in positioning. 
I would get it again but have some reservations 
Overpriced but decent. 
Excellent calculator poor construction 
Meh... okay based only on quantity of ink it will hold 
Wishing for better quality pen refills 
these dry up very quickly 
so so 
Neat but not one-size-fits-all 
Super Printer? 
Poor Horizontal Line Quality in Faster Modes 
Works with Linux but...

They're all right... 
Good product but expensive

Lightweight and easy to grasp but imperfect to use 
Not What the Pro's Use 
Only get this if you don't tape very often 
OK for home use 
Nice feel but some issues 
Lives up to it's name but... 
decent tape dispenser 
Cost is an issue 
ok for sealing boxes but I've used better 
Some nice details but still prefer the large tape guns. 
Good for homeowner use not for lots of shipping 
Handy & Attractive Dispenser 
No better than the standard dispenser 
Bic is a great brand 
Lead breaks too easily 
No Difference 
Responds to light touch. Not sure it's designed for daily or heavy-duty use; can't open to use on flat surfaces. 
Good not great 
Utilitarian folder for big projects 
Wonderful Idea but Overpriced for Card stock 
Great organizer for 8.5\ x 11\ (or even smaller) papers

Fair Product 
Compared to my Fujitsu Ill stick with the Fujitsu 
Not as impressive as I thought it would be... 
Great hardware and software combination at a very premium price 
Some installation problems but works but very expensive. 
Hardware is nearly there but software falls a bit short 
Mediocre Scanner 
How cool is this?!!!  [WAIT read to the end for not-so-cool bits.] 
OK but not the simple solution I'd hoped for 
Not for everyday folks but some business users will like 
A great idea but really slow 
can not be used outside of the program but scans okay. 
OK for archiving not so much for bookkeeping 
Seems Like a Good Idea - but Not Practical 
For the business traveler 
Just OK 
[Updated] It was \Neat compact efficient and handy\ but... 
If you buy it do it for the software! 
needed it

Almost perfect 
A gift 
Ink comes off from printing when touched

I WOULD OF RATHER SPEND A BIT MORE MONEY AND HAVE NO LEAKAGE!! DISAPPOINTED 
A Basic Phone with a Cheap Headset 
Works well but a really a bit out of date already. 
Good 
Some nice features but not enough 
Low Smell is nice but doesn't last as long either 
Ink looks like watered down paint 
Average 
all right 
Possibilities limitless but wastes labels and quality moderate 
Bad installation - good label printing 
Good enough for text-only labels 
It's nice but not needed by most... 
Very Slick Little Item 
Good decent phone overall.  Battery life not so great. 
Only fairly sticky 
Useful but VERY BASIC device for learning some common phrases. 
Great Idea but Could be Better... 
Functions fine but actual field test is only way to know.. 
It's Ok But Fragile 
Maybe I received a bum unit? 
Read the instructions AND practice (save phrases) BEFORE you need it ... 
Nifty Idea But Falls Short 
Needs improvement! A book is faster! 
Pleasing Translator Best Used As A Learning Toy. 
Good for the price and in a pinch... 
Seems to be for a very specific kind of traveler - and it's not me 
+ 1/2 star: good but not the best 
moderate-stick labels with a green bent 
as good as but not better than normal file folders 
Some nice features but too thin 
Easier to read labels easier to differentiate files COSTLY 
Love the colors... 
Gets the job done but doesn't inspire confidence 
It does its job 
A good functional sharpener 
Average Electric Pencil Sharpener 
Not as good as my Bostitch 
A decent sharpener 
our least favorite sharpener 
It's like sticking a  4 cylinder engine in a big old Caddy 
Not bad Low Use Sharpener 
Doesn't suit my needs - but may work well for you 
Just okay 
Lots of Colors~ 
Uncomfortable. 
Average quality chair | Still better than what you'd find at an office supply store 
Needs more magnet strength. 
Writing surface holds smudges 
Cute but needs stronger magnets 
Great for a cheapie whiteboard 
Yes it's okay....

Beware HP Ink Claims/Messages 
Not what I had expected... 
Not as good as the bullet pen and feels kind of cheap 
Is not easy to write cleanly with this pen 
Cheap price cheap product. 
Works slightly better than traditional labels 
Useful but not essential 
Apply to clean flat paper surfaces only 
Very good phone system 
Generic brand labels differ depending on who you buy from. 
withholding final judgement 
Great printer (for a while) support not so great 
Avoid 8500 if you use Quicken 
Uses more ink than HP claims! 
adequate but unexciting 
The majority of the cost is due to the wireless - make sure you need it. 
Wireless Stopped Working 
Swingline Optima Handles the Big Stapling Jobs Most of the Time 
A little too complex for its capability 
It works but it's big heavy and expensive. 
Easily removed yet still stick good again and again 
Use this as a place to keep my gift cards 
It works. Not as well as my thirty-year-old sharpener but it works. 
HUGE loud and time consuming 
Had high hopes... 
Not your ordinary pen. 
Works well for temporarily holding things

Sturdy Chair Poor Manufacturing 
Great Product 
Great printing low ink consumption but not reliable 
It's like a fidgety kid it may be demon possessed 
Good product but overpriced.

For Hanging Folders 
Useful within another file 
Dull colors made visual organization harder 
Thin cheap feeling cardboard folders 
Disappointed 
A clever idea however....

Standard security envelopes. Could be better 
OK but these could be better 
Very good if you need ledger printing. Not so good if you don't. 
Not too sticky. 
was okay! 
Brother Toner... as good as the printer it goes in 
Decent dictionary not so good sound quality 
Handy little gadget! 
Handy but lacks documentation for all the features jammed into this device 
Workso Prettyo Goodo! 
Could be helpful in a pinch - but not as straightforward and simple to use as I'd like 
Good But could be a bit better. 
Good Dictionary - Good Sound - Bad Instructions 
Good printer with some deal breakers 
Not very easy to assemble but the boxes protect 
The standard bearer 
Kind of cheap quality for the price 
It's okay but nothing more 
Just right size 
Decent board good size but the pen is bad and it left the factory damaged 
Basic board. A bit too expensive. No mounting hardware. 
Functional 
Decent cleaner and eraser pens very nice narrow lines but ink hard to clean 
Not so great. Good color but lots of smears. 
Doesn't Work Like I'd Hoped 
No Problem with Writing or Erasing 
D 
Just Okay 
It looks cool but doesn't work as expected. 3.5 stars 
don't need one 
Pictures can be bit misleading 
Hard sell 
A bit uncomfortable...not seeing the need.... 
Doesn't act like a pencil and takes some getting used to... 
An ok mech. pencil but I'm happy with the cheap ones 
great pencil 
Really tough lead is that enough? 
Innovative but falls a bit short 
uni-ball Pencil 
Spongy and imprecise 
eh hype 
Neat idea but not for me 
Good but a little wobbly 
It's okay. 
Works well as a pencil but...... 
Not quite 
Good but needs improvement. 
Kuru Toga Mechanical Pencil Review 
Worst Epson I've owned 
Not a Great deal but Better than retail 
Bought this for a rather junky inkjet printer... 
Solid printer unreasonably expensive ink 
Compatible to the Brother cartridges but the colors were not true 
They do the job 
It will crack and fall apart in 6 months 
nice colors but 
a decent sharpener 
Did the job but not as strong as other boxes 
okay for most uses 
Good for Moving or Storage 
Average strength great design 
Storage boxes you may need 
Pricey But Useful Boxes 
Boxes are solid but questionable reusability 
A Good Moving Box But A Little Pricey 
Not really what I thought they were... 
Nice printer.  Frustrating and buggy software. 
Great product BUT 
Hook 'n Go 
Only recommended if you want to latch a notebook to a binder. 
A little expensive for the quality... 
Can be useful but some features are lacking 
a good idea 
Not necessarily suited for special needs kids... 
good tool for beginning penmanship 
Nothing amazing here 
My son couldn't get into this one. 
Interesting product but mixed on helpfulness 
Unnecessary 
Constrains beginning writers 
Fine product but over priced 
Good quality paper but one problem 
It works & it's the loudest home shredder ever.... 
works okay 
Nice Phone But No Live Person In Service To Help Me 
A bit watery don't love the color 
Too over-built and heavy although sturdy 
2nd attemp to write a review 
Disappointing 
Useful product small packet 
Useful Little Index Tabs Another Good Idea from Post-Its 
Needs Documentation 
Good pointer presenter but... 
Nice little product but $75 seems a little high 
Take 3 gadgets strip functionality and mold them into 1 piece. 
Good but way overpriced 
Handy laser pointer controller and USB storage for your Powerpoint presentations 
A bit pricey 
Comfortable to hold but a tad expensive and not very bright 
Where's the On Button? 
Good: Simple elegant ergonomic....Bad: Price 
Price point here is the death knell .. 
No Wow Factor Here 
Lexmark Wireless 3-in-1 Printer - updated 
Way overpriced sticky notes 
Neat idea and cute but still searching for practical applications 
Nothing Special - Won't Stick to Every Material Type 
Different from Post-It notes and mostly in good ways. 
Weak adhesive and average durability. 
Great product but way overpriced! 
Great little labels 
Easy to remove but doesn't always stay in place 
Not sticky enough 
Time will tell 
Temporary Not \Removable\ 
These are okay but not much to get excited about 
An Average Product 
Removable Label Pads 
Great idea but edges curl too much to be practical 
Truly Temporary! This limits the applications. 
They are labels and have color! 
Strong !! 
Work as stated but nothing special 
A label that is easy to remove 
Decent labels but not as sticky as I would want it 
Avery Label Pad is just like a post-it note pad 
It's no Post-It 
Better for removeable than reusable 
Good labels for Typing 
OK label but not a great Avery product 
Not sure what they're thinking but.... 
Nice quality paper - too small 
Self adhesive labels that's all. 
Decent shipping labels but could be better 
Small Labels 
A Little Pricey for a Basic Label Not Sure How Useful They'd Be for Most 
Permanent Labels for Hand Writing Only 
Perfectly acceptable item that could have more value for others than it did for me. 
Ok 
let me try to help everyone having trouble 
Printing Around The Edges 
I'm skeptical of all toners... 
Nice but not for serious photographer 
3 Year Life 
Not for linux... 
Difficult set-up on Mac OS X Snow Leopard & turtle slow wireless printing 
Great printer uses individual color inks but it BROKE just after two years. 
Decent Printer with Some Big Quirks. Discontinued. Beware of over-priced offerings. 
Beware of HP Ink Messages/Number oif Copies 
Quality Is Good But Ran Out Too Soon 
individual colours are nice! 
A printer with many caveats... 
Wireless 2.4GHz Windows Keyboard with Trackball 
Not sure I like the thick hooks 
Ok but very bulky desktop unit. 
they work 
A good value 
After reading the reviews on this guy I had my doubts 
Stainless steel finish plastic :) 
Looks good but magnets are not strong enough 
Nice design with minor issues 
Pretty but weak magnets greatly lessen its value 
Just okay... 
Insufficient Magnets Make This Difficult To Use 
Functions well but looks very cheap 
Has some important limitations 
mounting magnets too weak otherwise ok 
an okay idea not well-executed 
Great for students and teachers 
Think it's leaving a residue 
Not too bad 
Easy to use but expensive 
Didn't realize this required a subscription 
A Nice Starter Package 
A Lot of Fine Print But It's Nice If You Need Lots of Postage. 
I like Stamps.Com...this is one way to get started. 
Not as Great as the White Label But Still Good 
Nice to clean up a box but not good for printing an address on 
Great for improving the look of a box but don't print postage etc. on them 
interesting but not sure about useful 
Works Great 
great labels but white are much easier to see and cheaper 
Good for reusing boxes; not great for address labels 
Great labels but worth the price? 
not intuitive at all 
why is it so big? 
Do the job 
Sometimes ok sometimes great 
Excellent adhesive.  Thin stock. 
Has some problems..... 
Might Be A Little Excessive 
3M Labels Are Fine But Instruction For Using The Templates Are Lacking 
Easy-remove 
See through! 
Holiday Mailing 
LABEL PADS 
Doesn't work on plastic totes! 
Full label is sticky but not super sticky 
These are so-so 
Basically A Post-In Note With Adhesive Across The Whole Thing 
not that different from regular post-its 
Good idea maybe needs a little tweaking ... 
Not lovin' them as much as I did at first.... 
Good but not great 
Good 
pricey 
Works well but has limited uses 
Sticky-back tags 
Great Idea Not a Great Product 
Good but quirky pricey.  Post-It Color Coding labels better option?... 
Mable Mable if you're able get a color coding label 
Bold 
Great product not sure why it's called \Super Sticky\ 
They certainly are bright! 
Not for use as postal mailing labels but good for organizing 
Great for easy identification 
Decent 
Love them - but paper width/thickness may pose problem for some printers 
Neat Idea 
Kinda so-so 
Not good for plastic bins 
3M Lables Are Fine But Lack instruction For Using Printing Template 
Compatible with Avery Standard labels 
Rather ordinary 
Does what it says! 
Not quite aligning right 
A bit thin and see-through 
Average labels -- not so thick 
only draw back is size 
Too small... 
A Nice Product But... 
Not great. 
A probably dying need done moderately well 
Meets my needs...slightly better than average performance 
What's So Great About Labels? 
Two lines only 
Sticky and small 
2000 teeny tiny labels 
They are ok but 
I prefer larger labels 
Return Address Labels 
not perfect 
3M Labels Are Fine But Instruction For Using The Templates Are Lacking 
Removable Adhesive File Folder Labels 
Temporary solution for filing needs 
Great way to reorganize your filing system but smudge with laser printing (inkjet fine) 
I'll probably stick with Avery (har har) 
We put these through a variety of tests - they work great for us but design flaw may cause printer jamming 
Pretty good product 
Stick Well but not the Brightest: Check Prices of Competitors 
Thin and see through... 
Holds back interior doors fine but isn't hard enough- difficult to put in place with just your foot 
Lots of options 
complicated 
2 year assessment (purchased this day 2 years ago) 
Not bad at all but not a great thing too 
Best Black ink for the Lexmark Pro901 printer 
Neat product but... 
Good for specialty labeling needs 
Questionable longevity 
Useful but Templates are PEST! 
Serviceable 
Slightly stickier than a Post-It made for a printer 
Not To Bad But Could Be A Bit Better 
Make Garage Sales Much Less Work 
Nice idea 
A Change of Opinion 8 Months Later. Originally a Beautiful High Resolution Photographics Eats Ink But a Great Step Up 
Slightly disappointed 
Good for Home Use 
Don't expect a perfect binding on your first try 
Useful and works okay 
OK for small quick jobs that don't have to look professional 
Good for at home use 
Good product for the design 
Love them - but we love Post-Its more 
good for a specific use 
Tab It: An Avery NoteTabs Review 
These are good but almost too thick 
A Bit Fuzzy but Otherwise an Okay Buy 
Good for some not for others 
They do what they should... and a bit more 
Seem Expensive For What They Are 
Nice product but flawed 
Depends on what you want them for. 
AVERY Note Tabs---Not Bad 
expensive for 20 numbered tabs 
handy 'pocket' for specialized use 
Convenient but too lightweight 
Not reliable or terribly useful 
Nice product but limited usefulness 
I wanted to like these... 
Handy for putting CDs in bound material 
Average at Best 
Innovative but not all that functional 
Avery CD Size PocketTabs- Great Idea but needs stronger adhesive! 
Okay nothing fabulous 
Easy to use 
Good basic label printer for price. 
Clunky and pricey but what is the alternative 
it is ok 
Good Scissors for learning to cut 
Germ free? But look dirty. 
not as good quality as a Fiskar or other brands like Scotch 
Pretty Sharp 
Great start: needs improvement! 
Great for very short-term but \become permanent with time\ 
Tab It: An Avery NoteTabs Review 
neat 
3 inches is too long for my purposes 
I don't quite get these! 
A Good *Idea* But Falls Short... 
good organizational tool 
Green notes 
Neat features but utility is questionable 
Weird size otherwise OK 
Don't care for the huge adhesive footprint of these tabs 
You get what you pay for for good and for bad 
Useful for those who frequently review hard copy content 
Good for the hyper-organized 
Best for thick-sheeted scrapbooks 
Terrific item for a limited set of users I think 
They are good for some 
Best for college students imho. 
Very nice product 
Good for organizing but could be better 
Avery NoteTabs (16336) 
Neat Item but Not Versatile 
ON THE FENCE 
Great idea for some applications 
Nice idea great functionality  might be trying to do too much 
Good for heavy duty books not for everything 
Good product but could be better. 
Good for the organized 
Helpful but other options might work better 
Useful but only for those who have a need 
Good but limited uses 
not very useful 
There are better alternatives 
Nice idea but... 
Does what it claims 
Seemed like a great idea at the time 
High Quality Product For a Unique Need 
does what it does at a steep price 
Nice but EXPENSIVE! 
Another fine product from Avery! 
Great but expensive! 
Labels work well way overpriced 
Great professional looking labels but may be cost ineffective 
Not cost effective 
Works Great Speeds Up Workflow but Quite Expensive 
Great quality labels at a high cost 
Nice Unit on second one.New Problems 
Very cute but not a workhorse 
Pretty But Cheap 
Nice color hard to use 
Lightweight multi-pocket filer tote with clasp and handle 
Decent carrier but I don't expect it to last too long 
sturdy 
Durable and lighweight 
Cheap 
Not Durable 
pretty small for us 
Mini Organizer 
Functions well 
Does the job but not customizable 
Great when it works 
EDITED: not so perfect hand-sized stapler for those with hand strength issues 
brand new and already sticks a bit 
Good stapler 
Not bad for light use but it has limitations 
An ok stapler 
It's okay. 
Good for home use 
Cheap ink wifi but..... 
Only OK - lack of dedicated photo tray and color ink requirement disappointing 
My Celebrity Apprentice printer is finally here! 
It's just OK but check out other printer before buying 
Adequate Performance no Fax function 
Glossy Kodak ESP 5250 Wi-Fi 
OK printer with a few shortcomings. 
Decent but not great... 
Prior model is better - Missing document feeder renders fax virtually useless - Touchsmart Web is a gimmic 
Nice Printer 
UPDATED REVIEW- BROKE FAST...Not perfection but fixed fast 
Solid easy to grip reinforced side gussets but too expensive 
Standard Issue + Plus 
A nice idea but needs to be more secure 
Fine for what I use it for 
Too flimsy for travel 
Flimsy 
Nice Idea but Too Pricey for the Quality 
Pricey but Works Well 
Not durable enough given the price 
Nice Idea but Flimsy 
Would Have Been Perfect If It had a Closure for the Larger Section 
Lightweight and handy but less effective than a sturdy binder 
Decent chair 
Decent but nothing special 
Post office mix up...item received 
Handy and doesn't sag 
nice little organizational tool 
3.5 Stars 
Not Revolutionary 
Ended up returning it but may be good under certain conditions 
It Works 
Steep initial cost unusable caller id in basic plan 
Flimsy but it's okay 
Lock is kind of tricky. 
Doesn't last long at all 
Great printer...setup not so great 
Gives You Great Color Prints at an Affordable Price! 
Great all in one for the office! 
A reasonable choice unless you require duplex 
some good some not 
Good ink for a Lexmark Pro901 
Good for Small Projects 
For Impressing Clients 
Pendaflex Organize Project Management System 
It's a Presentation Portfolio 
Well made organizer 
$30?  Really?!?! 
Sturdy and Expandable to a Certain Extent 
Seemed overly complicated 
Looks slick not really any better than your average binder 
Trying to organize 
If you want luggage tags 
Disappointed 
I far prefer the LapGear DELUXE LapDesk over this LapGear Jumbo LapDesk. 
Could use a better surface or a ridge on the bottom. 
It's Okay But There Are Easier Ways To Get The Job Done 
Cool design 
Nice colors too easily smeared -- nothing special for the price 
A little messy 
Maybe I got a bad batch 
Brilliant colors- some ink flow issues 
Decent pens 
Neat for kids 
best for 4 to 5-year-olds 
I think they put the wrong age groups on the cover. 
Practice of Number Writing Made Easy 
Numbers yes; Stories no. 
May Work For Some Pre-Schoolers But Too Easy for Kindergardners 
Not sure where the number \stories\ comes into play 
Not a bad idea however.... 
Best for the summer between K & 1st grade 
How to build a sentence. 
Helpful to my daughter for her cursive letters 
I nice intro to creative writing but simplistic 
Nice concept 
Better suited for 1st and 2nd grade 
It's OK 
HELPFUL FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH WRITING 
If you work with 2nd graders...pass this by 
Colorful but... 
Basic Writing Prompts 
Another simple idea overpriced 
Basic building blocks for writing skills 
Very heavy duty. 
Decent board but make sure you buy some different pens 
HI 
All these scales are the same! 
Home-Brew 
Greenwashing ... 
Thick plastic tab attachments for folders 
Smead Easy Slide Tabs - Decent Innovation But Still A Work In Progress 
Not quite what I was expecting 
maybe a good product but not for universally for everyone 
These labels work great but cost too much 
Way Too Expensive 
Great quality labels at a high cost 
Ok but 
Good Quality but Too Big! 
Decent paper shredder but not so good for credit cards 
So So Shredder 
Works but too loud for small office! 
average  nothing sectacular nothing bad.  just a good price. 
Wish Someone Would Build a Better Lap Desk 
I've had blenders that work beter. 
Too bad 
Three Stars 
Bargus 
Sticky Notes with Not So Much Stick.. 
How come none in plain old white??????? 
Good in Some Situations 
Not as advertised but usable 
Keep tabs on your notes 
for the anal retentive but too expensive 
Quite Flimsy 
Beware! 
Not comfortable for me but a decent chair for a smaller frame that needs good support 
It Has Potential But Not for Husky Guys Like Me 
Some good some bad things with this chair 
Nice Office/Computer Chair 
Intek Refill Kit 
N700 Speaker Lapdesk - Imperfect But It Fills A Niche 
Is a great printer until....*don't buy it 
Excellent except for Ink Useage 
I LOVE this printer BUT. . . 
Concerns about color quality 
Great printing epic setup 
Ink Eater 
Frustrating... 
Decent footrest but weak fan. 
Could be much better 
OK as a footrest.. climate control not so much 
Low on the List of Necessary Products but It Helps My Back 
Five-star concept two-star execution. 
Noisy fan.  Footrest too thick for long legs in flat position. 
Maybe it's us but we can't seem to get it to work...? 
nice little office device 
Solid construction; I wish it were more adaptable 
Has some flaws but the wife seems to enjoy it. 
good support but fan stopped working. 
It's OK... 
Perfect for the office 
Great prints but no more Kodak 
Foot Rocker Needs Improvements.... 
Item will not go together as descibed. If you have enough room to get a good angle it is a comfortable rest 
Hmmm 
Needs more features and a wider range of adjustable options 
Can't get the wheels on 
Tough to assemble squeaky no manual 
Did Not Assemble Properly 
difficult to erase 
Not how I thought it would work  ~ 
Just your basic pen 
Not exactly what i am used to from Bic. 
Good sharpener with some drawbacks 
Weigh Your options carefully 
Bogs down easy but does well with re-sharpening 
Not Bad But Not Great 
Nice looking sharpener 
iPoint  Pencil Sharpener Does the Job But Lacks Visible Support 
Grinder 
Acceptable but not great 
Bit expensive for the power! 
Sharpens fine but user experience is less than ideal 
Not too terribly impressed 
Average pencil sharpener with great design 
Know of better sharpeners 
Takes too long; can't get a really sharp point 
Thoroughly Adequate 
Ok for low use but not meant for anything more 
Pretty good but not great - 3.5 stars 
Great Pencil Sharpener Except . . . 
You'll need the cleaner for sure 
BIC Dry Erase Marker Kit 
nice replaceable eraser! 
Great cleaning but... 
Limited Use--Must Have a Flat Wall 
Thin & rough velvet \velcro\ 
Still has the problem of attaching in a humid climate 
Roughly equivalent to mirror mounting tape in strength 
Not intended for use on windshield 
Strong fastener with inadequate adhesive 
Smooth writing but the barrel is friable 
Not the best pens for the price. 
wish the pen felt a little nicer 
'Professional Look' a 'Triumph' for BIC. Writes you know like Hemingway or Palin even. 
Not ideal for a lefty and a bit larger than \fine\ 
An acceptable writing implement 
The temperamental pen 
Good pen for those with carpal tunnel or arthritis 
Good Markers But... 
Rather clunky 
It works but is it necessary? 
Cute and handy but best for the true Post-It fan 
Small Convenience At A Small Cost 
Convenient but average product 
cute post-It despenser 
Uses non-standard post-it's and plastic dispenser is tacky 
It's OK but pricey for what it is 
Completely unnecessary little widget works well enough for clutter-freaks 
A Simple Holder for Post-It Notes; Entire Pad Comes Out Too Easily 
Typical post-it dispenser 
OK not miraculous 
Another option for Post-it lovers but not as good as expected 
Handy  but unnecessary Post-It holder 
Non-Essential But Handy In The Right Environment 
It Sounds Good In Theory 
Cute & Handy Pop Ups 
Another Plastic Gadget 
Pop-up works but velcro doesn't 
works wall-mount is a nice touch but do you need it? 
Post-it has let me down 
Handy but...Doesn't use regular post its! 
I'm iffy about Kodak in general 
Good Quality But. 
Good Price 
It's Okay......... 
Same Old Problems but probably the best of the lot 
very tiny but good 
acceptable 
Evil Necessity 
phones 
Nothing special about these 
The long cord is a problem for me 
Swingline Retractable Badge Reel 
Good on pocket or belt 
Colorful badge reels! 
About average 
decent but so many options out there 
No alligator clip limited ways to clip 
Good Idea 
Nice colors good price though spring is pretty weak... 
Not quite what I was hoping for 
Not that much of an upgrade 
A Functional Pad 
Inexpensive but Limited 
Hard to use 
Good printer/scanner 
Could be worse could be much better 
Crease machine overall very good 
Good OEM Ink but a poor combo 
Its heart is in the right place. 
Better than expected but a little pricy for cardboard I think 
Nice idea literally a bit rough around the edges 
Good idea but lacks in execution 
Very ROUGH binder 
so so 
Too Light in Weight. 
CUTE but Looks and Feels Cheap. 
Cool design but needs added weight too light and will fall over easily 
A fashion statement but not very useful 
Cute 
Cute but Flimsy 
Fun but Lacks Some Function 
Cute but needs improvement! 
Cute girly gift but a little top-heavy 
Cute item but too lightweight 
Only for 2 handed tape dispensing 
Cute but needs a lot more weight 
It's adorable but... 
Really cute. 
Darling but it IS too lightweight 
Good probably not worth the small downsides 
Convenient but unnecessary 
Good product but not as good as it could be (3 1/2 stars) 
Do I Really Need Another Gadget? 
gets the job done but 
Works very well but expensive to use. 
A pretty nice specialized product -but not for everyone. 
A better mousetrap. 
Underwhelmed 
Nice Concept But Not That Practical 
Nice Albeit Pricey Tape Dispenser. Functions as Advertised. Made for Gadget Fans or Those Who Like to Use Pre-Cut Tape Pieces. 
Handy but perhaps a bit overdesigned 
Still Can't Beat A Roll Of Scotch Tape But...... 
Not very practical or economical 
Cute little item but maybe not for a desk at work 
Just OK 
A Handy But Pricey Tape Dispenser 
just a gadget.. 
Am I not doing this right? 
Great idea but flawed 
It's a great idea but . . . 
OK But Not Great 
A once-a-year purchase 
Okay for specific purposes 
It sticks! 
OK The Lazy Person In Me 
Fun and kinda handy but a product few people need 
Once you how to set it up . . . 
Convienence at a cost. 
Interesting concept but hardly an improvement in tape dispensing 
Good for kids or the office but not for everything. 
fun but I'm not crazy about specialty refills 
more of a gimmick 
Good concept. ok execution 
Have to buy special tape packets for it 
Handy but it doesn't really stick to a desk 
Serves the purpose - nothing too special 
Good for Paper and really light stuff ... 
good but not as safe  as you might think 
Good but do you really need it? 
great way to hang items 
They are ok 
Nice for light stuff. 
Wow!  Sticky! 
Great if you only have posters to hang (Revised review) 
Couldn't handle a poster 
sticks to most things very well but doesn't remove from paper 
Useful in certain circumstances - 3-1/2 stars 
For Lightweight Mounting: A Scotch Reusable Tabs R100 Review 
pretty good for light weight objects 
good idea but? 
Useful for select applications 
So much more attractive than strips of tape 
Strongly recommended as a substitute for tacks (beware of painting removal from your walls) 
A Good Idea for Those Who Can Use Them 
Nice Idea But Limited Uses 
Sticky yes... perhaps too sticky 
cute but flimsy 
Cute but doesn't feel very sturdy 
flimsy 
Try harder next time 
Fine .. for kindergarten 
This tape is okay...... 
It's Tape 
The tape we have known for years in a slightly revised dispenser 
At the end of the day it's just tape 
Loch Ness Tape dispenser 
Better Than Glue?  In Some Ways Yes Others No 
Nice concept but adhesive not that strong 
Definitely useful for selective tasks but a bit expensive 
Not good not bad 
not what I expected 
Gadget; but is it a serious tool? 
Good For Scrapbooking 
great product but not environmentally friendly 
A great alternative to traditional tape & gluesticks but not so permanent... 
May be great for some purposes but not so great for mine. 
Good alternative to double-sided tape poster putty and tacks 
Great for light stuff 
Reusable Within Limits 
Fine for paper & cards but won't hold much else 
Work well but not very strong. 
A temporary solution but not a great one. 
Great product at first but... 
Not up to the task 
Not exactly \super sticky\ but convenient idea 
Neat Idea 
Doesn't stick how's that super sticky? 
Great concept but doesn't stick to EVERYTHING 
Great Idea! 
Not in love ~ 
Works but covers up a lot on the page 
I'm Rather Organized But Have Zero Use For These 
Good concept but not as practical as I'd like 
Over the top 
Labels are huge which is good for writing; too sticky though 
Useful in a fairly limited way. 
Thin glue can get messy. Dries white so don't use for clear products. 
BEST super glue and I'll tell ya why 
It is what it is 
Each Tube a Single Use 
Not For Free Endicia Postage Accounts 
good for now! 
Inadequate Word List In My Opinion 
Average to Good Gadget 
Good tool for elementary grades 
Great for kids. A little limited for adult needs. 
Not much better than the competitor... 
Decent scanner room for improvement 
Slow Time Consuming 
Messy 
Lots of Features but a Few Fell Short 
Very cute questionable dimensions of inner compartments 
Useful but not very deep 
Functional but pricey... 
I thought it would be sturdier 
Slightly Oversized 
Pretty Organization Sometimes Frustrating 
Narrower than it appears 
Expensive wherever you buy it & hard to use 
Narrow Tidy-Looking Has a Small Footprint 
As a standard cordless phone it's average 
Nice-looking commodious 
It's a pleather letter tray no more no less. 
BIC Great Erase Have their Use 
Just OK 
not dark enough 
Not so smelly but not so vivid - stick w/Black 
Good pens but a bit light. 
Colors are very light not what is shown 
Not as great as I had hoped 
Could be very handy but it isn't without flaws 
Handy but not that exciting 
Post-its in a paper dispenser 
It's fine but nothing special 
handy -- but is it really necessary? 
Don't really use it too much... 
Overrated 
Maybe for Post-It die-hard fans? 
Works ... but ... WHHYYY???? 
Fair To Middlin' 
Neat concept but... 
Does what it says 
Cute but hard to use 
Fun but not particularly practical 
Like the idea 
Just when you thought they had done all they can with sticky notes 
There's not much to say;  it's a post it note + dispenser 
Not that useful 
Fun product a million applications not enough post-its in a pack 
OK product 
It's OK. 
Nice post-its but I don't use them very often. Quite pointless in the electronic age 
Good idea not so great execution. 
Difficult delivery system 
Well-designed but could be more durable 
Hmmm....fairly flimsy and missed the mark 
It's Post-It Notes 
Great idea that loses value for mobile travelers and budget minded users 
Hard to refill horrible colors sticky residue 
Great notes but not necessary 
I Just Don't Get It 
Nothing to write home about 
...a great idea nonetheless 
Good for a cubicle 
Different but not better. 
Okay but get's used up real fast 
Not bad but a little disappointing 
Convenient but unnecessary 
They're Okay 
Just OK 
Maybe useful for somebody 
Just ok. 
Slightly Convenient but not worth the effort 
dispensing is nice limited applications 
I like the table top not the hand dispenser 
Useful and convenient in limited application 
Get the Refillable Deskgrip Dispenser -- Not This One 
I like the handband dispenser... 
I think I'll stick with my old desktop tape dispenser 
Very convenient for Christmas Eve. 
Kind of neat Kind of a pain... 
A tale of two tape dispensers: one I liked;  the other not so much 
Eh. Kind of awkward 
ingenious tabletop dispenser but wrist dispensers lacking

ok- doesn't roll 
I coulda' been a Five Star contender .... 
More like 792 Labels -- Good Quality Though... 
good labels 
Okay but not great. Too thin! 
Does the job 
Great product just over-priced 
Yes these are temporary labels 
Nice idea for more uses of the Post-It Notes. 
Hard to peel off the pad! 
Faint Praise From a Post-It Addict 
Fine for temporary labeling 
Great quick little labels but not a replacement for a label maker 
Worked great on some surfaces but not others 
Too sticky for me 
Good Labels 
Sticks 
Ok good inks 
Too Heavy for Road Warriors/Bad with Receipts 
disappointing 
Perfect for small messages. Packaging Issue 
Message & Note Board 
Serviceable gets the job done 
Milky pens cheap feel to it. 
Not the quality I was expecting 
It's good for attention-getting notes 
not as nice as expected 
Pretty colors pop on black background 
A little hard to read 
Kind of fun for a change of pace 
Better in Theory Than Practice [3.5 Stars] 
Good product but colors fade 
Mostly same old same old 
Average quality; nothing special 
A decent set. 
These work well enough 
More than I needed.....

Love the feel. 
Sturdy Brown Notebook Made of Mostly Recycled Materials; Can Not Be Customized; There are No Storage Pockets! 
Recycled goodness.  Basic functionality. 
Not a heavy duty cover 
Stripped Down But Stylish 
Over-priced and over-hyped - its a binder 
Recycled material and fun option for customization 
Ok binder good starting point. 
Nice But Pricey 
Nice that they are recycled 
Darling but thin 
Nice look but... 
One time use 
It's Ok for an HP 
Some intriguing new features but not everything you'd want; quality is fine for ordinary use but not professional 
Conflicts with Sony 
VERY NICE  FOR THE  PRICE ! 
Doesn't last as long as I'd like... 
Slightly Tight Fit 
Board good Pen bad. 
Mine won't stick :-( 
Get a different marker 
Awesome boards dud marker 
Convenient but there are flaws 
Only one sticks... 
Great concept 
Don't stick well small writing surface 
Great idea.  But there are a few small problems 
Not For Me 
Perfect for memos but one board can't be used out of the box 
Great Little Magnets Not So Good Marker 
Functional solidly built but marker will need to be replaced 
Ink is just too expensive. We are suckers buying these products but we don't have a choice. 
Very expensive 
ALL ink is outrageous!

Portable 
eco friendly but skimpy 
Just Okay 
Seems expensive for what it is 
So-so notebook 
A bit too light for my tastes

It tapes 
Good tape.  Holder sometimes doesn't hold.

Nothing really new

Fine but nothing special. 
Good paper quality perforated pages fall out. 
Not as Good as the Older Ones 
So-So Spiral Notebooks 
Hefty notebook but poor paper quality 
Not sure who would use it. 
Lots of pages but week spiral 
Just too bulky for me 
The cloth accents and lack of a tri-fold design makes this NOT the Trapper Keeper I recall 
Same Simple Design From When I was a Kid 
Adequate at best 
but it's like after 30 years 
OK for medium-duty use 
Not all that secure 
Weak Binder Rings Overall Good Lightweight System 
Rings are awkward for me to use comes with paper graph paper dividers and handout & pen holders 
Useful 
Those rings gotta go 
Good files but bad closing mechanism. 
Nice Pocket File but with one major ergonomic issue (adding/removing documents) 
The actual product is fine 
Harder and more brittle than I was expecting 
Fine.  Sturdy.  Exactly what you'd expect. 
Nice file 
Limited Expansion 
Average Binder 
They'll slap on the 5-star onto anything anymore

I would trade the clearview cover for interior pockets 
Clunky spine design 
Versatile but Questionable Durability 
Eh I'm Not Feeling This One... 
Flexible 
Weak Binder Rings Overall Good Lightweight System 
An interesting idea that I didn't like in practice

A little advanced for my weight loss goals 
Limitations!

It does what it was intended to do.... 
LIGHT IN UNIT WAS FAULTY......AND MORE DISAPPOINTMENTS! 
Not useful for mosquito control 
It's a great moth killer but... 
A good bug zapper but attracted a lot of moths 
Kills everything not sure if it reduces mosquitoes 
Effective but not completely; and it DOES CLOG (at first!) 
First bug zapper = DOA second one is bent but works

Nothing To Brag About 
Good reel mower 
Flimsy 
It does the job but I might try something else next time. 
fair but not great 
Not sure 
Mice trip Kness Tip-Trap by walking ON it... flawed by design 
This is why the reviews aren't great 
A tiny gripe - why change what was working? 
Well made but very hard to clean 
I like this product 
Too big bulky and heavy for the hanging cord 
WORKS INEXPENSIVE NEEDS A HOOK ADDED TO HANG 
Expensive 
A Little work involved 
OK for what it is 
\one touch clean up\ - not quite

Good But Needs Improvement 
Sturdy but could have more handy features

Perky Pet Squirrel be gone bird feeder 
Cost VS Practicality 
Better options exist but holds a lot of seed 
Yes It IS Squirrel Proof BUT... 
NO squirrel damage...but...NO BIRDS either 
Nice Feeder but Ridiculously Expensive 
Perch legs are too short 
Much bigger than I expected worried about how long it will last 
Attractive functional feeder - little birds love it 
Perky-Pet Squirrel be gone not really 
The Good and The Not So Good 
Good product but I can't justify the price 
large but seems a little flimsy 
Best for small seed not whole sunflower seeds 
Squirrel proof but birds don't seem to like it either! 
Looks good but not completely effective 
Made well but needs a 2.0 version 
Nuts to you!! 
Nice but the birds don't seem to like it! 
There's something about the design that birds don't like 
ok 
not for uneven yards or yards with rocks/roots - blade will get bent 
Got what i paid for. 
not useful 
Not sure if they work. 
Not particularly scary 
It works......... 
Works well but..... 
Not for short critters

not large enough for my generator 
Flimsy but works.. 
So-so 
Okay For What It Is... 
Good for light duty task. 
Not for fall cleanup.... 
For blowing out garage and walkways 
Should have gotten a longer trimmer

not professional quality 
Serves its purpose. 
Classic but not for me.

No noticeable difference 
High Hopes 
Havahart Deer Off 
Effective but with caveats... 
works fairly well for rabbitts have no deer issues

Apply rinse repeat. 
Not Sure About This 
adequate for small areas for short periods of time 
Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer Rabbit and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer 
Effective but doesn't last long 
May kill your plants... 
I must have stubborn deer!! 
Clever idea- if the pump worked. 
I thought it might work but didn't do much. 
Seems to work on rabbits but not on squirrels 
Not particularly effective 
Seems to be helping 
Got Rid of Annoying Squirrels...For a Couple Days 
Havahart battery powered repellent 
Maybe Another Season of Use Will Determine Effectiveness 
OK so far 
Somewhat works! 
It worked but not consistently 
Red squirrels didn't seem impressed.... 
Arrived damaged. Really damaged. 
Difficult delivery system 
Limited success with repellent (but nice sprayer) 
Sprayer didn't work 
Works well until it rains or you water the plants.  So you have to reapply often. 
OK 
Elephant repellent? 
I don't know if it is good 
Not that great

Trap door pain to open and setup 
Good Quality and Function 
Effective...so far. 
Only one tool in the arsenal against the suburban menace 
Mixed Results. 
Perhaps not the most effective for larger acreage. 
I am so torn about this product after two months of use 
Works But Only for a Small Area 
Good in Theory Not as Good in Practice 
On the fence about this product...maybe an actual fence would work better! 
Problems out of the box 
Not Rocket Science 
Counterintuitive 
Wait And See 
Clever Solution to a Serious Problem 
Early returns are good. 
Works Depending on What You Need 
Deers Begone. 
On the Fence 
No Idea If This Works 
more maintenance than I expected... 
Not  so much.. 
Nozzle started to drip quickly after first use

Good for exisiting gardens and flower beds but not so good for starting one 
Does NOT zap mice.... you'll want something else for that 
insect spray 
Seems to work for now but can't be sure-Spray leaves visible residue 
Not Havahart's best 
Great If The Cup Was Not So Flimsy 
Easy to use 
Expensive and the cup arrived broken into several pieces 
Works But Hard To Spray 
Works in some instances but not around bird feeders...squirrels are addicted to those 'fast food meals'

OOPS! 
Perfect refill for heavy duty use

If you have a large yard... 
For Small Jobs It's Okay 
ok; not as effective as actual aeration 
Works but for large areas it's a lot of work 
Requires some heft on new construction 
SO SO 
Itw okay 
According to the State of California these tools contain lead. 
Kills mice quickly once they agree to walk inside the kill zone 
Seems like a well made product. I just haven't caught anything in it. 
Multiple parts missing lid not as secure as others 
Homeowner quality 
So - So results 
Good product but does NOT have a shoulder strap 
Heavy hog... 
Better Than The Other B&D We Bought 
Clipper ruined by the tiniest of twigs 
Looks and feels solid.  Still made in CHINA!!! UPDATE 3/6/13 
Hard 
Work great but no size specified 
Not as advertised - deceptive claims 
Overpriced...but certainly usable... 
So-so bench that came with one broken piece and other damaged pieces 
Arrived broken 
Some Assembly Required 
Okay but not perfect 
Good fire pit. Not bad but not great either. 
Durable and attractive but poorly machined so the parts don't fit well. 
Don't leave it outdoors! 
Limited use but it might be right for you. 
Mixed review 
Nice features questionable efficacy 
Works if you use a lot 
Used around our birdfeeders

Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. 
Effectiveness is iffy...expensive for the amount provided.. 
doesn't save my peaches 
Not sturdy enough 
OK 
Good Pruners BUT.......Bad Locking Mechanism 
Great for it's size no power 
This is an effective formula will kill your moles in ... 
Seems to works but be careful around pets 
Extra care is required when using 
Not sure if it works. 
Easy to use my dog was attracted to the area where I buried them. 
:(  Takes at least two days to kill them.  :( 
Unsure 
Hard to tell if it works. 
Toxic gummy earthworms - seems to work but hard to be sure....

Over Priced 
Sprinkler head 
Works OK 
Zip ties probably work the same 
Ok not strong as I would have liked. 
Not terrific will use my other products instead 
NOT \safer\ for Pets and People 
those pesky ants still crawling around. 
Diatomaceous Earth?  Or Mixed with Boric Acid? 
Seemed to work for a day or two 
Works With Patience.........Expensive 
Poor delivery system. 
Did not work well 
This product needs a better dispenser

OK item 
Adams Quik-Fold Side Table 
Not as robust as I hoped for thick hedges 
It's okay 
Handy Device 
Good Tool Rating Based on Dismal  Battery Life 
Decent alternative to edible (and perishable) baits 
not sure if the cost is justified 
It works but is an unecessary expensive when peanut butter does the trick ... 
Non-toxic and doesn't stink haven't caught anything yet. 
This may work but.... 
Looks promising. 
Don't notice any difference 
no mice! 
Works but I question the claim that it is \better than cheese\ 
Works about as well as peanut butter. 
Nothing really wrong with the product 
smok'n 
pros and cons... 
Kinked on first use 
Mid-class hose at best. 
leaking problem. 
Works for Some Animals

For the birds 
I've done ribs on it quite a few times

Get something better if you can afford it 
The Birds Are Happy 
Some birds like it some don't 
Mediocre quality 
Not sure on this. 
OK Not great.  Look for other possible alternatives 
Average seed 
Little more than an appetizer to our birds!  Hardly a success! 
It will blow over in high winds. 
Difficult to make straight edge. 
Mediocre 
VERY smelly; moderate effectiveness 
Hasn't caught a single fly in a week and stinks to high heaven 
Works for house flies not others 
Stinky but only moderately effective 
Very Stinky and Not Sure It's Doing Anything...

Difficult To Set... But It Worked 
Trap *can* work but gets messy and may kill non-problem animals. 
Maybe I just have smart mice... 
Not my favorite 
Disappointing.

Quality needs improvement

Large Capacity Feeder That Won't Leak -- Until You Remove It 
Great!  *May 17-Change in my rating...sad! 
An OK Product But I Prefer Planting Flowers To Attract Hummingbirds 
I prefer smaller feeders and here's why. . . . 
Not My Favorite Perky-Pet Hummingbird Feeder 
Toss away the nasty food. 
Hummers Avoid This One Most of the Time 
The Hummingbirds Give it a Five / I Give it a Three 
large on volume - fewer refills required 
Huge capacity but difficult to clean the base 
All setup and ready to go 
Not Great for Knotty Pieces 
Works but not for 4 months 
Time 
Only effective at close range and as a surprise for skunks 
Had hoped for more. 
Not bad 
eh?  so/so 
Fantastic for two seasons but no more 
Arrived bent but worked out OK 
Interesting concept 
Gardeners Blue Ribbon TMC60 Tomato Plant Cage 
For small tomato plant

It's not the ultimate tomato cage... 
OK for light plants maybe not tomatoes 
Not always working. 
Good gopher bait applicator but results may vary. 
Works OK but Need to Find a Good Bait 
sturdy product but leaks 
Basic needs 
Some slick design features but not effective on tough ground 
convenient 2 in one 
Not having a whole lot of luck with Texas bermuda grass/ clay yard 
Works in \perfect\ soil but gets caught in anything else 
Haven't caught a gopher yet 
Hard to rate... 
Bird Feeder 
Not Really That Impressed And Could Be Dangerous For Birds 
Nice feeder but the squirrels win again 
Mediocre feeder 
Maryland birds weren't interested -- until I forced the issue 
Does Not Live Up To Its Name 
Squirrel-proof....and bird-proof too 
It's okay...but the look is clunky 
Looks nice but the birds won't use it 
Not Quite Ready For Prime Time 
A little on the cheap side 
Ok I guess but needed string to tie against side of pool 
It's okay 
Peat Pot 
UPDATE-Return IF 2nd hose just rec'd - see additional pictures. 
Works ok 
About what we thought on hindsight... 
I Must live in a NO THROW ZONE!! 
Makes shoveling a little bit easier definitely underpowered 
Some Good. Some Not So Much 
Ugly good for dogs not cats nor on hard ground 
No Big Dogs!

Its ok 
It tends to kink but it is lighter weight and ... 
cute but impractical 
not the range i had hoped for 
Good But Not Great In My Opinion 
No way will this hold 175 feet of 5/8\ hose 
Assembly a bit of a challenge 
Notes on assembly

One-time Use Traps 
Cannot endorse or condemn 
I prefer snap traps. 
Expensive is a \cleaner\ way to kill mice but not the best. 
Hard to rate since it's not resulted in any trapped mice. 
1 in 4 actually caught a mouse but it's SAFER FOR KIDS 
Just Okay 
Simple Solution 
Functional although it is nothing fancy. 
Okay if you like soaker hoses.

Great when it works! 
Only lasts 2 years but worth it!

Decent enough 
My baby got tired of this quickly

Baby is the Key Word 
My toddler couldn't have been less interested in this toy

Doesn't hold up well 
A classic with some major flaws 
A Great Game With More Flaws Than Any Other Out There 
The Truth about Resident Evil... 
fun but gets boring 
A Tale of Souls and Swords 
Still the same with improvements 
Crusin started a style all its own. 
A decent port of the hit arcade title

Gets Old Quick 
an okay game 
Star Fox Review 
World's Cheapest Game 
Bugs invade...You go back in time...Classic story-line.

Only use it if you must. 
I hope the sequel was better than this

Still a great story. 
Fun but not Amazing
