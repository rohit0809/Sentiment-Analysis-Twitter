What was Capcom thinking? 
Butchered arcade to home conversion

The start of the best game seris ever 
Pretty awful 
Concept is good but tedious game play really spoils the fun 
Boring Game! 
*Your Connection to Westwood Online has been lost* 
banjo kapooie 
Alright 
Not that loyal to the movie 
a 2-star rating- I seriously can't give it a higher star 
Best game ever? Sure and Laetitia Casta is my girlfriend. 
Rage Wars is Better 
Maybe the most disapponting videogame sequel ever but not the worst. 
Lacks sorely when compared to previous installments 
The Most Frustrating Thing ON EARTH!!! 
Mario's first jump into the land of 3D platforming stinks

this game is so slow 
Why is this a classic? 
Adventuring ain't for loners 
everyone loved this game 
WAY OVERRATED 
A little too difficult for its own good.. 
The only thing &quot;horrific&quot; is the play control 
A party rental at best 
Boring Boring and Boring 
The incredible loading made this game not worth it 
And even more of the same...again. 
Resident evil at its worst 
Totaly Disapointing........ 
Disappointing 
Eh?

Sega goes bye-bye 
Sega finally gets it right...but too late 
Stinks like his brother

One sixth of the game is okay.

Not my cup of tea. 
Good looks awful gameplay 
Disappionting 
A fun shoot'm up. 
NewPort 3rd Party Generic Super Nintendo Controller 
Tolerable unspectacular PlayStation work-alike

Expected a mammoth got a chiewowwa! 
Great expectations greater disappointment!! 
Alright not the best Maxis game out there... 
Uninspired 
It degenerates!

Popularity does not imply quality people... 
Poor entry in the GK series 
Does not hold up to Blizzard's standard

One huge glitch you may want to avoid this game! 
Much better on the PC 
Poor Storyline 
My 'Journey Beyond' Stunk

This game should have been great. 
A recreated classic educational but very boring 
2nd Worst Old School MK Gameboy Game 
Strangely like its sequel

Absolutely horrid one player game 
Nothing compared to Quake. 
If N64 tresspassed onto Dreamcast. 
Final Disappointment VIII 
Disagreeing with its average reveiw

Could have been the Final....period. 
One of the worst of the series 
Worst in the series get final fantasy anthology instead 
The Next Chapter In The Final Fantasy Saga Is Here!!! 
Don't expect much...

Hope you have an ass kicking machine 
WHAT DID YOU DO ID?! 
a lower than ok game 
Not The Rayman We All Know And Love 
Spine tingling story line.  Mind numbing play...

Too hard to control buggy 
A victim of it's own realisticness. Way too dark. 
Another Sub-Standard EIDOS game 
Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation

Maybe I'm Nuts.... 
DF2 (Unrealistic corny and just plain dumb.) 
OK but could be way better 
Typical of Origin 
What should have been a great game 
Much the same 
Star Trek new worlds 
Oh so close! 
A bit of a letdown 
Command a Starship and Grow Old Doing It 
Just does not deliver where it needs to 
Torment for a reason 
Could have been much better a real disappointment 
My black box said I crashed because of graphics turbulence.. 
Still can't get it right 
Just a cheqp Starcraft imitation 
Computer crasher 
Ok... What do I do know? 
This game is just plain boring. 
Mega Memory card for Game Boy Color  an okay device 
Haven't played them yet 
Get the PC or GBA versions instead. 
Entertaining for a short period of time 
Absolutely the most pathetic software program ever written 
Gets neither the style nor the substance right. 
Only somewhat faithful to show 
Not as good as Mario Land 2 
Ugh. Why the Game Boy? 
Non-stop action with the dynamic duo 
acclaim got lazy 
Oh BOY 
Title should be called Batman \tarnished\ Forever 
The difficulty kills this game 
If you think that this is a good game then you seriously need your head examined 
For die-hard fans only 
Come on Rare I want my Country. 
How is this supposed to be fun? 
A disgrace to the company the title and the genre

Where's the Plot? 
Not quite good enough 
Mediocre at best. 
The duke's first 3rd person game 
nice but 
Batman license + Mortal Kombat influence = a digitized mess 
Batman still tarnished forever even on the SNES! 
A near-bust 
Not as good as I thought 
Not really my thing but I respect it as a classic 
good game... but maybe not quite a classic 
So frustrating!!!!!!!!!! 
It was Boring Back Then and It is Still Boring Now.

Patience is a Virtue 
Painfully difficult 
There's some good and more bad to this game... 
Dissapointing 
Remake of the original 
not much fun 
My least favorite of the Metroid games. 
Too hard to be fun or innovative 
Frustrating

Not very good. 
a real wipe out 
Beware of this system 
Decent but cheap as hell. 
WTF? 
Bo-oring! 
Sonic Labyrinth 
Sonic 1995 
Old school.  Like PacMan type old school.

Could've been the greatest game ever but 
An original take on fighting games. 
Sound concept...lame game. 
DULL + BORING = BAD 4 OUT OF 10

The Most Disappointing Dragon Ball Game... 
Japanese Version is Better 
Fun at firstbut it tends to get boring quickly
