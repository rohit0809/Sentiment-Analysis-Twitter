read the negative reviews first 
Can Be Frustrating 
It sucks but it won't let go!

Not impressed..... at first 
Not good enough 
Seem great in theory but didn't work for us 
Really wanted to like it but didn't work for us 
Not my choice for baby... 
These bibs are heavy!!!

Did not work for my little one 
poor design 
Neither of my kids would wear it through the meal 
Not the best for my little guy 
Not Great For Toddlers but Maybe for Younger Spoon Fed Babies

Child Falls Out 
WARNING!!!  DANGEROUS PRODUCT!!! 
Wasted money for us 
BORING 
Buyer beware; this isn't the perfect fit nor the safety conscious gate it promises to be! 
Good idea but bad execution - needs TWO adjustable sides 
better gates out there 
Falls flat...literally 
ok pregnancy body pillow - not so great 
Better for back support 
I would say Ok 
A pillow is better 
too hard! 
Built Much Differently Than Other Jumpers... 
Not for big kids

Can split at seams 
Straight to the junk pile 
assembly required. 
Not Impressed

Not a match for us 
2 stars just because the bottle is cute 
Leaky and had a nipple get stuck on us 
Not What They Used to Be

He dint like them 
Babies didn't like them

Our Least Favorite Potty 
Door knob covers: no challenge for your toddler!

It was working fine and then it started leaking within a month. 
I don't understand the hype

Some use but never cared for them much 
Nice design but thin material 
Doesn't Work With Britax Bassinet

Too Many Bad Qualities 
The only good thing about this gym is the bear 
Eh it's ok. 
Hard for little one to get on. 
Hop-ful but didn't pan out. 
Doesn't work for boys 
Not the best for boys 
Falls apart 
Would have been great if... 
Wait to see if your baby is a \swinger\ before buying 
Not as many activities as the laugh 'n learn barnyard animals one 
Project stop working!!! 
It broke before my son could use it 
Shuts off TOO SOON! 
Concept was good..practical use bad. 
A little dissappointing 
not sure

Not worth it 
Good but One Major Flaw for a HighChair Toy 
Annoying 
This doorway jumper sits funny to one side tilting

Why redesign something that was great? Prefer the original! 
Very disappointing light...

If your child is teething on the rail they are capable of removing this as well

not very versatile 
Leak pee almost every time... 
Not what I thought 
Don't waste your money

Nice but didn't work for long 
It's okay. 
Cute but almost completely impractical--not worth the money :( 
Bar is not that great for the money... 
my baby hated it

Functional but not Practical 
I only like it because it is organic.. 
soft but incomplete seams! 
comfy sheet but too big for pack & play mattress 
They are fine but this isn't an american company

Not flexible enough 
Strong odor Made in China 
Comparison of 4 baby tubs! 
Not for every doorway! 
Don't use this if you want to transition to a crib... 
I wish I had heeded the advice of the many reviews about

Works great runs big but zipper broke 
It works but... 
Not supportive enough for larger breasts 
Worked for awhile... 
Not great heavy busted women... 
My zipper broke so I made my own hands free bra that I liked better

Get the simple wishes one instead. 
good idea but bad fit 
Not for everyone 
Nice idea tricky to use 
Simple Wishes is Much Better 
i just made a mess with this and definitely not worth the money.
