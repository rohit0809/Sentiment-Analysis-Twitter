My first dive into the Get Up Kids 
the bands best work to date 
rocking it with a soft touch 
Something worth checking out! 
Good but nothing to write home about

toxic waste 
Best band in the nu-metal genre by far. 
It's been said many times before...

Great message 
anti-myth rhythm rock shocker 
Tough tough review to write:(

One of the three essential Deep Purple albums 
Much more varied than MACHINE HEAD but not quite as strong 
Solid As A Rock 
The Best Example Deep Purple's ability to REALLY ROCK 
I pick this one up just because it was BUSTA 
Whoo Haaa 
Busta took us through total anarchy on this one.......Tight! 
Not Busta's Best 
Smooth Bass filled beats 
Hotter than Fish Grease 
Solid 
Busta Proves to us that he is hip-hop's top personality.

Veruca Salt alum scores big 
You'll listen to this AGAIN & AGAIN 
One of the better new bands... 
Very Good 
It's not the best but it's not the worst either

Four pretty tunes do not a classic album make 
Sitting at Four 
Cat Stevens shifts toward prog-rock 
Taking the Bull by The Horns 
Typical Cat. 
if this is bad then I can't wait to hear the good stuff! 
It is a nice mix

A classic back in print 
Digital remastering at its best 
The Drunken Sailor of Sardonic Wit 
A Liberation From Stupid Vanities 
if the last two pavement albums sounded like pavement... 
very similar to pavement's terror twiilight..... 
The truth about this album 
The Moment's Over. 
Good job Mr. Malkmus! 
Almost Five Stars but a tad boring 
Fun and Funky 
A step in John's upwards trend 
It is what it is 
A relatively well selected compilation of Lush material 
Music as colorful as the singers bright red hair. 
Great Collection Bad Remastering. 
every single time (history repeats)

The best of his later work 
Well This Sure Isn't A Crime

Not perfect but pretty close 
Break The Cycle 
Just my opinion 
Staind with perfection! 
If you have a heart Aaron Lewis wear it on your sleeve!

An essential addition to your metal collection. 
This is more like 4 and a half stars 
its not dysfunction but its good 
not the best but 
No five star album but very good 
This album has grown on me 
Don't let It's Been Awhile be your judgment 
raw emotions that leave you staind 
One the better Nu Metal Bands 
Better than I thought 
. . . Cuz Depression is fun! 
One of the best rock albums out there! 
Dashboard Confessional &quot;Places You Have Come To Fear...&quot;

Exilarating and ultra-heavy 
The third and least satisfying weezer release... 
Joyous Little Record. 
Really good comeback album: nothing more nothing less. 
A solid record from a solid band but there are weak points 
I like Weezer. 
hip hip

The album that started my life as a jazz fanatic. 
Two-fer of classic 1972 soul LP and its 1973 follow-up 
Quiet: The New Loud? 
it grows on you 
THE MAN TWO 
A pretty solid effort by Travis - it's not a great album but you'll probably like it if you're a genre fan 
Not just your average English band 
'The Man Who' continued. 
A stunning follow-up to a classic 
Flowers In The Window. 
Beautiful beautiful music! 
Probably Better Than &quot;The Man Who&quot; 
No surprises.
