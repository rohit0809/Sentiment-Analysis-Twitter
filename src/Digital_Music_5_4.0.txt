A Liberation From Stupid Vanities 
if the last two pavement albums sounded like pavement... 
very similar to pavement's terror twiilight..... 
The truth about this album 
The Moment's Over. 
Good job Mr. Malkmus! 
Almost Five Stars but a tad boring 
Fun and Funky 
A step in John's upwards trend 
It is what it is 
A relatively well selected compilation of Lush material

not the best but 
No five star album but very good 
This album has grown on me 
Don't let It's Been Awhile be your judgment 
raw emotions that leave you staind
