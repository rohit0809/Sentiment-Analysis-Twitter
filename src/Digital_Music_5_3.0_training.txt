A Good album 
\Can I stroke you up!\ 
Keep it slow ladies... 
ohmygod! it's Pet Sounds. wuptifreakin'do 
Over Hyped 
Looks like I'm swimming against the tide but whatever 
anticlimatic at best 
Wouldn't It Be Nice...? 
Pet Sounds 
I wish I could like this more 
&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; surround mix basically 4.0 
Influential and important? Sure. Great? Not so much. 
Dated 
Essential Jazz Album for Your Music Library! 
Gorgeously tired

3 songs 
Enjoyable from beginning to end.

Not one of his bests 
overrated 
Not his strongest effort but still good 
basic beats less fury 
Is an album that was great but is dated now still good? 
his first solo album 
R. Kelly invents himself on 2nd album. 
Good solo debut 
Good album overdoes it on the bump and grind stuff 
BackBack or forth and forth 
R. Kelly featuring Aaliyah

This CD is OK. 
A group for today but not for posterity

More fun from 'little' Elvis

An impressive album 
Nice Roger Dean Cover 
Guilty Pleasure 
popular? 
Non-commercial/commercial Joni 
I like the title track

1986  \Mechanical Resonance\. 
Robbie's first solo recording... 
Broken Arrow 
Hippy Drippy Folk Rock 
Great back up band 
And missing every one of them

Not one of my favorites.......um well.....i cant say it.... 
Soundtrack music 
Trip-hop trips up a little 
princess tracey! 
&quot;Protection&quot; left vulnerable by high expectations 
protection 
HORRIBLE except for &quot;i got 5 on it&quot; 
Had its moments 
Hint of greatness to come 
three decent tracks; rest average 
Cool beats from the mid-1990s British Invasion

Feels Like Home 
Neneh should have more industry clout

Dated but Fun 
Pretty Good

Average Underwhelming and Immature - 3 Stars 
Toni's breakthrough album. 
Only Slightly Above Average 
Toni Braxton can put you in the mood. 
It's R&B but there's not a lot of \soul\ here 
A decent sophomore effort... 
Gotta Love Her Voice! 
Quite Frankly This Could Have Been Better. MUCH Better. 
Outkast cash in 
Good Not Great!! 
Thug? Gangsta? what??? 
Strong entry for his catalog 
Good but NOT GREAT

Before they wore out their welcome.... 
Technically impressive craziness leaves room for songwriting maturity 
Good But Overrated

They Forgot To Include 'After The Dance' & More! 
Prophetic? 
As much as I love Johnny Gill... 
So-So! 
Let's Get the Mood Right 
All The Great Singles! -1 +2 =? 
PLEASE  someone out there help me! 
Not bad but the flaw is the edited versions of LH and ANMHE!!! 
Missing Medley 
I liked it but was not blown away. 
Not required listening but at times rewarding 
Skip a few love the rest 
a final album of cover versions and his last of the 1960s

The energy's gone 
Characters needs soul

Provocative 
Good effort though not as strong as Johnny Gill 
A Simple Waste Well Almost 
Hard to believe this botched set is still in print... 
\SURRENDER\ Missing 
A Long Long Conversation 
OK but still lacks that 70's magic 
3-1/2 stars 
3 1/2 stars--I liked it more back then 
Pretty good... 
Too many cooks spoil the chocolate mousse 
A bit dry of a debut but I think they're onto something 
They got better after this

BIG PROMISE BUT WAY OVERRATED !! 
Worthwhile! 
A Great Choice For The E.J. Fan Who Has It All 
The real reason to get this is the \Friends\ album tracks 
Cameo 
All and all...it cannot compare to the earlier TFF 
Hot and cold 
Contains some good songs and a ton of photos of the band's lead singer 
Great but look elsewhere if more than a casual Abba fan 
Ain't Enough Meat On These Bones 
Live 1992 Concert Mixes Old And New Songs. 
Magic of Red Rocks and the Orchestra is there - Production is Not 
Scorching sex-a-thon still relevant 
Some great moments 
a country band with a rock attitude 
Some great singles mixed with real losers. 
3 big hits omitted 
LIVIN' ON MY HAIR 
The Band Truly Reached a &quot;Cross Road&quot; in their Careers 
Great CD 
Decent Start...but hopefully a better one will come along 
Made in England 
High peaks coupled with low valleys= OK 
A mixed bag of Grant and Donald  treats 3.5 stars

Source of several much-played 1970 songs. 
A very nice album 
Elton John Is Just Not All There 
Good debut

uneven concept album from the tin pan alley twins 
A Couple of Good Songs 
IT IS NOT GYBR! 
How fantastic? 
Elton Takes A Stab At Significance 
Far from Elton's best 
The Tone Can Just Drone 
Go for the box set instead

Pretty good material

My opinion - for what it's worth 
A Tentative Debut 
Young  For What He's Worth  Saves it! 
first album 
Jackson Browne out 
Someone's choice for &quot;best of&quot; but not the right one 
One man's best is another man's....

Triple threat

Try to imagine what silence looks like. 
MOST Over-rated album of the Genius known as Prince DO NOT buy first! 
Not bad but they've done a little better

I like the CD but wish it was only the original song line up without the bonus tracts.

Balance & Options REVIEW! 
3 Stars 
Not a masterpiece but contains two great singles. 
Honest Brutal and Afraid of You 
Leave The Singing To Stuart Murdoch 
Just about half good 
Confused mild success 
Decent but doesn't hold a candle to &quot;Sinister&quot; 
There is more and better 
Great tunes but lacking 
Ups and Downs 
Brutality at its best 
Good Album 
Eminem 
Overrated slighty dated but still brilliant in spots 
Some great rap but it's definitly not pretty. 
Not impressed 
Funny lyrics and.....what else? 
this is one nasty sick MFer!!!!

This was rushed; could have been better 
Chocolate Starfish Hot Dog Water Mix 
The New Street Fighters 
I won't totally flame this CD but... 
What happened to Durst &amp; Co.? 
Not really special generic 
Infantile laughable retarded yet catchy. 
Music you can jam to but talent is lacking 
Combine the first two albums and you get this one

A nice change but................. 
Oh so average 
Same as Significant Other but... 
The downward spiral continued 
Solid Debut
