the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned
impossibly tiny and difficult to operate 
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press 
the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day 
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive.
the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it 
i am very pleased with its quality and durability
the phone is small , light , and very attractive
i did n't had any problem till now
when talking the voice is not very clear
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made
the light auto-correction is awesome
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy
after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera 
pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run
i wish i could give negative stars !
buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money 
when it works , it 's great , when it does n't it 's frustrating
their customer service is very poor
The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly
The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will
All in all, not good
Would recommend to anyone and everyone!!
The positives outway the negatives
Product great-long-lasting
product is great
