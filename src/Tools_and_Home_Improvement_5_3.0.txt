Not Fun to Load 
Drain valve is cheap paint was still wet when packaged. 
Nice product 
Good but not great 
needs better adhesive 
Worked good....for a while 
POOR ADHESIVE 
Adhesive could be a stronger... 
Not sticky. 
Foam is great adhesive not so much 
Depends how you want to use it 
Just ok. 
Great workman ship 
Plastic construction is not a good thing. 
Pee-Yoo-Sah!

Great deal I guess... but I'm not so happy with the blades 
Works OK 
GET A SELF CLEANING ONE 
Fragile but good for the price 
Good for Straight Lines 
Leaks short throat 
Solid clamp 
Works but very limited capabilities

the verdict is still out 
It is an Old model 
Good bi-metal throw away hole saw 
Okay for making a hole but 
Drill bit broke on first use... 
Better light than MOST LED's but battery hog 
Great construction poor design? 
No Air Inlet Fitting? Really? 
It does the job most of the time. 
Great Light Duty/Home/Hobby use Compressor 
Good drill poor batteries 
Poor chuck mount and gear selector make for a weak showing 
No blade longevity 
Over Priced

Great tool but some problems 
good motor poor bases 
Nice router just needs accessories 
Bit changing is a pain! Literally. 
Fake Price Decrease

Bundled Accessories But Limited Usefulness 
What everyone else said. 
Very accurate 
It works but nothing amazing 
Versitile

Not bad... but not enough pressure for bigger guns or jobs. 
Good but not great 
Does what it is supposed to do. 
Hard to adjust 
Good design 
Must have for Bosch router.. 
Works fine 
Will get the job done not exactly what I expected 
Always center the template guide 
Template Guides 
Okay for some but utilizes 2-piece construction 
Very good tools but not so good accessories. 
Crude adjustment mechanism 
It's an average router in both fixed and plunge category 
Could be better 
I Expected More From Porter Cable

Why would you ever use a planer without dust collection? 
Ok for what I've been using it for. 
This unit is not fully functional you have to accessorize 
Fatal Flaw 
Works well but not enough to buy again 
Nice idea needs work suggest a different tool 
Not easy to use 
Overpriced overhyped underbuilt and RIPPED OFF! 
Overly sensitive to dust moisture. 
Haven't used it yet but bought it to replace another waterpik and if it is good as the other I purchased with this one...
