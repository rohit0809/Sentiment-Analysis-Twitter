Ineffective in the war against acne 
I wish you could test it before spending money on it.

Same product in new package 
Doesn't work as well as others 
I should have known ... 
Slightly better than the usual over-the-counter products

It's As Simple As A Pimple 
Not As Good As Other Products Excessively Drying 
NOT the solution for EVERYONE... 
acne treatment 
dry skin 
A decent product...but keeping up with 3 steps is a lot. 
COMPARED to other systems 
Not for me... but it might work for you.... 
Another acne treatment

Average skin care product 
Felt nice but I don't think it works any miracles. 
Nice Product Not All-natural 
Great for the colder months but it remains oily under the sun 
bio oil is OK 
Haven't Seen a Change Yet 
Not for me because it contains mineral oil - a petroleum by-product. 
Basic Ingredients Work Sometimes 
oil feels nice 
It's okay 
Does this product actually work? 
What's the harm? 
sweet smell 
Satisfactory but not stellar results 
It's an oil- that's about it! 
A skincare product without Botox

OK Mascara 
Flakes 
I've used better Organic mascara 
Not my favorite. 
Pass on this 
Much too stiff for the face 
Crystal clear with NO sediment or cloudy stuff!!! 
It's OK 
Decent 
Too hard to apply without smearing your shadow. 
Didn't keep my brows from smearing but does help with pencil bleeding into fine lines 
it works. 
Eyebrows 
Not what I expected 
Got moldy fast 
makes your hair dry 
ehh 
Long.  Hard to hang onto in shower.

Be Smart about When and How to use 
It's ok but not a magic.. 
Not the best Egyptian Magic Cream I have ever tried 
Not sure.. 
It's okay but definately not magical for me. 
I don't know about magic... 
Not such a good deal! 
Silky Smooth Legs 
Similar to using Vaseline very greasy 
It works sort of. But it's also kind of scary. 
Doesn't fit all hairdryers

it is good but not the best 
its okay 
MY WIFE SAYS IT HAS A FISHY ODOR 
Great if you can get past the smell 
Does what it's meant to 
Not really my type 
lasts a long time but scent seems to change based on body chemistry 
It's not all that. 
OOOHHHH 
Chips and not true color 
It's not what it's supposed to look like 
Not really Tiffany blue 
audrey 
Got a completely different color than I ordered 
looks different in person 
burnt monster/beautiful 
would say i liked it but it REALLY was a pain in all ways 
Colors different from other covergirl products 
CoverGirl Creamy Natural Liquid Foundation 
alright mascara 
just okay 
Weights down lashes and a bit too hard 
Brush is way too FAT doesn't allow for detailed application 
covergirl lineexact liquid eyeliner 
Works great but broke out 
Beware if you have dairy or lactose issues 
a tad bit disappointed 
Not worth the money 
Smells yummy 
It's not better than a good moisturizer 
So So 
Just ok 
Just another gimic? 
I thought it worked. 
Works but not a good value 
exfoliates but no blackhead eraser for me 
Cleans Well - Not worth the cost 
\Eraser\ is a bit too potimistic of a word 
Been there before 
Name is misleading 
An expensive option for face cleaning. 
Good cleanser 
Okay acne and blackhead prevention...from Clean & Clear. 
What's an eraser? 
Does about the same as any other acne product over the counter... 
CLEANER but not an ERASER 
Forty Bucks Worth of CRAZY! (UPDATED) 
Great concept.... 
Good for prevention but doesn't erase them 
i think i'm allergic 
refreshing but doesn't do the trick 
Doesn't actually clear away the blackheads 
Makes your skin feel clean 
Not all it is cracked up to be 
Works okay... 
No blackhead eraser 
It Does Reduce Blackheads But... 
Good vibrations 
More of an exfoliator type product 
good price for a portable cleaner 
I don't see how this can be any better then scrubbing yourself 
Nothing to cheer about 
Good for skin massage not so good at removing blackheads 
Another not so good eye cream 
Not Great but Not Bad either.... 
It's ok 
not the best product for my skin 
Night Treatment is O.K.. 
lasts a long time 
RoC Multi-Correction Night Treatment - yucky ingredients 
it bit to harsh 
I Only Use 2 Colors! 
4 different sizes 
Okay for an inexpensive set. 
Cheap 
nail bruches 
Didn't notice any difference. 
It works..but please be careful 
Okay 
day one: notes from a peeled chicken 
Chest acne 
Not what I ordedred. 
Please be CAREFUL - Read this first! 
didn't do anything? 
Its okay 
Eh 
Fine but not worth the money 
Good as moisturizer 
Eh 
No significant difference but it didn't make redness worse 
serum 
Ok but not as expected 
Well it's not working for me as well as it is for other ppl but... 
Not Sure About This Yet . . . 
Purchased for my bleach fried hair... 
Cheap looking but does the job. 
nice 
HAIR DONUT 
For \Little\ Bun 
Received my product early 
Meh 
Can't Get It To Look Like Picture 
Meh 
Fun 
Mixed feelings 
Donut? 
Stink odor 
Too big of a bun for me.. 
Works with any type hair 
Just Okay 
Good End & Bad End 
OK - For the Price! 
whooah 
don't order in hot weather 
... 
Not strong enough for me 
Tingle Effect Wore Off Quickly 
Love it larger size brush is more stable and lasts longer 
Almost a really good mirror. 
Washed off pretty quickly 
Eh it's hair spray 
Almost too effective - have to use sporadically 
Okay but not the best! 
milkyway saga gold remy 
I tried many fragrance free shampoos and conditioners 
Not the best for my hair 
It's ok
