Better than Dirt 2 Except for.... 
Fun 
An unfortunate disappointment (Campaign review only) 
cover 
Nice But..... 
Great for the price 
Does what it should 
different then I thought they'd be... 
one 
works but flawed. 
Cheap cheap cheap 50% works? 
Great Idea. Doesn't Last Long. 
So bad it's entertaining 
The ultimate mediocre RPG 
Starts out great but loses steam near the end of the game 
Good but not great 
Hmm 
IT'S NOT THAT BAD 
An overlooked classic 
Difficult! But a decent game 
Could have been better 
Fighting Force 
not bad 
A better game than the original 
Unbalanced difficulty of levels 
More of the same 
Same as the original 
I couldn't download it. 
Fun! 
Too frustrating for me interesting but not fun.  Half life is past its half life 
Myst for the Testosterone Set? 
Unreal requirements! 
its ok 
Not quite what I remembered

A Gaming Great 
The Ninja stealth game

Not so much fun after awhile. 
CB 
Crash 
The one that started it all! It's easy to tell. 
Really three 1/2 stars 
Crash's First Outing is Flawed 
It's good 
Would be a PS1 classic if it wasn't for the controls... 
So much potential!! 
A Good Game Ruined By Horrible Controls 
Doesn't hold up well 
A classic with some major flaws 
A Great Game With More Flaws Than Any Other Out There 
The Truth about Resident Evil... 
fun but gets boring 
A Tale of Souls and Swords 
Still the same with improvements 
Crusin started a style all its own. 
A decent port of the hit arcade title 
Ended up selling it 
This game is good for it's time but the Wii virtual console version is much better. 
Gets Old Quick 
an okay game 
Star Fox Review 
World's Cheapest Game 
Bugs invade...You go back in time...Classic story-line. 
Not My favorite game. 
It's an OK game but... 
Adds a nice touch but a bit expensive 
good 
A necessity but over-priced and only slightly impressive 
Only use it if you must. 
I hope the sequel was better than this 
Great Graphics and Gameplay 
Good game 
A good Zelda game but not the best 
One of my least favorite Zelda games

Game Boy in Technicolor! 
Could be better. 
Smoke'm if U Got'em! 
REPEAT 
Too much fluff 
Not long enough 
Not the best price nor construction 
The Best for N64 not the best there is. 
so many rings... I want more 
just use easy mode. 
Not the worst game ever but not a great one either 
A BIG LET DOWN! BUT STILL  A  AWSOME GAME! 
cd Rom + What do I do? + Impossibilities = 
not the strongest in the series but decent 
Well it's better than Myst 
Too opened-ended for most. 
Not so great after removing rose-tinted goggles 
I'd like to shoot the &quot;camera man&quot; 
It rocked and kick ass back in the day ......... 
Talk about overrated. 
Not bad but still a bit overrated. 
Great once Now it is outdated 
Decent but highly overrated. 
History of Square's Love Affair With Itself Part I 
it was okay 
Potentially good possibly overrated. 
Decent game. FF8 is miles better in every way 
The age of innocence lost 
In my opinion the most overrated FF. 
Someone was drunk while designing this one.... 
The point is? 
Same ol same ol 
Resident Evil is back but with nothing new 
Wasn't what I was expecting 
A great classic but sure to be better on other versions. 
Did like this game

Sega have no idea when to realease their systems 
Good but not for everyone 
Sorry for saying this to Dreamcast;s fans... but../ 
Not great but good. 
They are alright but just dont have enough space on them. 
Unique but really quite useless in terms of original features 
Quick game no challenge great graphics / cinematics 
Nice 
It's really a solid game it just get's old fast... 
A cool way to pass the time 
A derivative of Diablo with some original touches 
Pretty good 
Good game large requriements 
three for me means average 
Too Big 
how to get this game working with XP/Win 7 
Terrific Fun...  hard to run on modern systems. 
Hasn't aged particularly well 
Sonic is Okay... 
Best 3D Sonic 
A good way to spend an afternoon 
Overrated but still decent 
Great 3D fighter 
Some Shock value... 
Good game but cost unrealistic 
Innovative twist on an old genre. It's doom with ghosts. 
A mixed blessing for lightgun fans but fun none the less. 
Dynamite Cop...it isn't as &quot;dynamite&quot; as it seems 
It's no Streets Of Rage but it has a few strong points 
Three Stars 
An ok to good game. 
Limited Scope Busy Mech Graphics &amp; Bugs! Bugs! Bugs! 
Here today gone tomorrow

Cheaply made 
It does the job 
Fun untill... 
Good Game but......

A decent starting pad for emu-gamers.

Dated and Shouldnt Have Bought it 
What is all this hype about 
Half-Life Heresy 
Great Multiplayer Experience 
Okay 
Mixed feelings about the ending... 
it is &quot;OK&quot; 
A little weak compared to the others 
Mixture of realism and arcade 
Buyer Beware 
Good and Bad at once 
Good but not indepth 
Kind of Fun 
Hits and Misses 
So-so 
competent light fun but not spectacular 
How far we've come. 
AOE just didnt mix 
Great when it came out

Nice thought-but a little watered down. 
Brutally Hard

Too easy to die in the beginning 
Disappointing but worth consideration 
The teaser title 
Average game for it's genre. 
overrated ? 
After Spyro 3 this stinks for a youngster 
Video Game 
Mediocre game with alot of bells and whistles 
A classic but not an especially well-aged one 
Good for its time 
Hard but fun.

Space is the place...for action 
The games are excellent but... 
Fairly Good

Fun to play plot needed work though.

[4 Stars] One of the best entries in the series. 
A Sweet Beginning A Bland Middle and a Sour Ending. 
They rushed too much... 
MAYBE THEY TRIED TO HARD? 
Final Fantasy VIII... Just the facts 
A Complex and Tender story.  BUT WHERES THE GAME!? 
disappointing 
First FF game I didn't feel like finishing 
Not as great as I had been told. 
The Negative Reviews have their points 
Fails to Live Up to the Final Fantasy Name 
Good but no comparison to 7. 
So-So or just Okay you choose 
Not the best FF

UT is better enough said... 
Quake III Arena 
Must be more to it! 
Had expected a better game

Good try but falls short.. 
Graphics are the &quot;Enemy&quot; Here 
Captivating mind-bending and addictive 
A fun story a fun challenge and a fun new character! 
I Hate the Camera Actions 
It needed more Evolution... 
Perfectly wrong color 
Don&#65533;t install this until you&#65533;re done with the original 
It's fun while it lasts 
I dont think you will like this game 
I REALLY want to like this game but... 
Very Interesting 
Could Have Been an Outstanding Game 
Retains the visual flair but you bog down too often. 
Different 
Too exhausting to be enjoyable 
Good at first but then gets boring 
better then Diablo. . .but not best of all 
This is what I waited so long for? 
Over rated not much better than Diablo 1 
I'm not so sure... 
Diablo II. . . 
Fun at first but fails to captivate. 
Fun...but a Little Boring 
Click click click... 
Good game marred by awful save feature 
Great game for a limited amount of time. 
Clearly A big budget title....but money aint everything

Falls Short 
Good beginning [bad] ending 
Against the flow 
A Semi-Good Sim Game 
Not as good as some Sim games 
Satisfies one's love for digging 
I am a tester for maxis and EA 
OOOO Thats not good... 
Great game?  Bad game? 
If not for the ending(s) it would be a 5 star game..... 
Impressive but it just ain't Wing Commander... 
Nice graphics no story 
i give a low rating because i don't liek Simulators much. 
Things that make you go Huh! 
Good but not perfect 
very well made. 
Good Game...for a while 
A good story tormented by disappointing gameplay 
Memories

Love Hate Relationship with this Game 
A nice little nostalgic hop 
Two brilliant games...what went wrong?

Fun 
Frustrating &amp; Confusing

One of the only good n64 games 
Be wary of used 
It's very fun but it isn't really a DK game in nature... 
Meh. 
Fighting Force 
techno bliss!but no one listens to....... 
Very depressing. Great for gloomy rainy afternoons.

Mortal Kombat Trilogy ~ N64 
Bigger better yet not complete... 
Not the best

Worth a rent or two. Buy it if you find it for less. 
A good game to rent on the Weekend 
Upgrade from the usual Doom but still Doom is Doom 
DOOM 64 not as good as PC/PS1  but still good 
PASSABLE BUT MEDIOCRE 6 OUT OF 10

Great game it's just not for me. 
It's over? 
Loved it when I was a Kid..

It's ok 
Very good at the start but... 
With the exception of the Sandcrawler level this game rocks. 
The Kobayashi Report 
Great SNES title still doesn't hold a candle to the arcade 
A tremendous achievment marred by gameplay 
This game is ok and just ok! 
MORTAL KOMBAT!!!!!!!! 
Creative game but nothing compared to later games 
The original standard setter. 
Great Graphics and Sound...but that's about it. 
Not as bad as it's made out to be. 
Fairly enjoyable

Somewhat Fun But Doesn't Live Up To Legacy 
Good at the time but nowadays a joke

It was the WWF game of it's time. 
Love hurts in the World Wrestling Federation 
FUN AND GREAT WRESTLING GAME. 
A disappointment 
A Great Thriller!! 
Fun but nothing spectacular 
Fun game 
severly lacking even considering its old age 
Terrific game horrible pathing 
Not a bad buy 
not the best but worth spending some time for it 
Flawed AI brings a potentially excellent game down to average. 
Great for a Trek Game; good FPS overall 
Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force 
Try and find Armada 2 if you can 
One of the best Trek games but still not brilliant 
Full of bugs is correct! 
A good strat. game. 
Its OK if you have a decent PC. 
Great as far as Star Trek goes but middling in general 
At last! A merely satisfactory Star Trek game... 
Turn back the clock and try Clock Tower! 
A good game 
Good game in the Xmen franchise 
Ha! 
Pros cons zombies.... 
Short and Sweet But What Was the Point? 
Fun to play but way too short for the price 
Fun for a while then it gets old real fast. 
CCGR.ORG's review 
Save your $$..... second thought review. 
Style over substance resulting in insurmountable problems. 
a very well done game 
I know my first person shooters this is the worst 
Incredibly difficult! 
Dissappointing and a little dull 
Great Look.. Needs more story 
Impressive at first but considering price gets old quick

It's gettin' obsolete 
Good and Bad 
Good Game gone Bad 
fun....but kinda annoying...

The blue bomber's GB debut (3.5 stars) 
Nice game but like the NES original it isn't without it's flaws 
One of the best fighters on the Super Nintendo but still feels like its missing something. 
Nice job Nintendo. 
Nastalgia 
No longer quite as shiny 
Not so new anymore now is it? 
Good Nothing More... 
I am going to start off by saying \I looooove Mario!\ 
fun as a 2-player game 
This classic is a little dated 
Decent action 
Pitiful shortcomings in what could have been groundbreaking 
They say hindsight is 20/20...This game wasn't as great as I remembered. 
Interesting attempt at a 3D game. 
Meh. 
Different 
Enjoyable 
annoying! 
a great game! 
Just Like the Gameboy Advance game 
Don't buy this when you can still get the original model!! 
average 
A Magic Twist 
A few new levels to a good game 
Better than Sonic 3DBlast. I say a sequel to SMC is due 
A nice attempt at something different but... 
Works... 
Because some days you *have* to throw the controller 
Still a great story. 
Fun but not Amazing 
It's really not that bad 
not a big secret- it's an adventure 
LET'S BE MORE REALISTIC HERE 
It's ok I guess... 
The trilogy that didn't deliver 
Best home console version but still bad 
Not bad

Overall good game. Has flaws. Be ready for blood. 
Fun and unique but over way too quickly 
Memory lane.. 
An OK game

A challenging game for ages 6-12... 
Lots of fun but much too short

Not to challenging 
How does this work... 
Extremely overrated 
Too Buggy 
Okay But Could Be Alot Better 
So you want to run a Roman city... 
Good but Two Big Problems

Boring or charming? 
Simple and easy rpg

Lacking the Tiger's bite

On second thought worth playing

Nonsensical puzzles. Get the DVD version.

A classic.

Big New Idea for the First Person Shooter Genre

Come to Mars View a Load Screen 
Not Sure 
Be Wary of Rayman... 
OK Adiition to Half-Life 
Really Good but way too easy and short - but the H.D. Pack Rocks! 3.5 stars! 
None-too-thrilled 
Will BS gonna keep this series half alive? Yes. 
Way easy 
Good idea but way to short. 
Take my advice 
New levels and new challenges in both good and bad ways but pales compared to the other expansion 
Half-Life: Blue Shift 
Fun a bit too short not quite worth the $$$ 
I'm disapionted with this expansion. 
Average game in the Final Fantasy series 
3-and-a-half-stars; nostalgia 
Fun but shallow 
Good but short and cheap in places 
Houston we have a problem. Our A button is wearing out! 
research this game before you buy 
Okay Game! 
Not bad but not that good either. 
Kinda boring 
Not bad but not good. 
Glorified Version of Tetris 
Mario Kart Clone less than famous characters new modes 
Recommended only for those with a GBA light.

Good but room for improvements 
Replicating the magic of Symphony is not so easy... 
Just Okay

Not Much Wireless Without The Rumble 
Okay

Great game but needs something... 
Well it's a heck of a lot better than the previous games... 
Decent 
Fun for all DBZ fans! 
A flawed single player game. 
Love it but it shoulda had improvments and the whole saga 
Great presentation but the gameplay needs improving 
No lasting appeal whatsoever 
Same great gameplay if you can get past the graphics 
An  Average Game !!!!!! 
good game 
Pretty Cool 
A Fun Fast Racer without a Lot of Depth 
A reasonable alternative to GHOST RECON. 
A hit and a miss. 
Let's be different 
Decent Fright Factor But Not on Resident Evil's Level 
Not sure about this game 
It's really good but... 
an annoying disgrace 
On the better side of Average. 
dont judge a game by its title 
Great plot mediocre everything else... 
Skip this one and the second one and jump right to part III. 
Great RPG for any RPG gamer 
eh 
Not Bad But Certainly Not Great 
Darn my eyes why don't I like this game? 
It is Evident Why I Ignored This For 11 Years. 
Decent game especially found at a decent price 
Some good game play...some hype though 
Lots of Blood - Bordering on Gratuitous 
A fun game but mine feezed on 8th level 
Missing a lot of features

Enternaining 
A Webslinging OK time 
Could have been great 
Definitely a Rental 
Fun fun fun - best Spidey game to date 
BETTER THAN THE FIRST GAME. 
Nostalgia quenched 
Great but......... 
Great games... two of them anyway. 
High Scores are KEY for these games 
You can't save your high scores 
Worth the $$$... 
Game came dirty but in the end it works 
This is an OK game. 
Um.... 
O.K. Game but its missing something 
Incomplete 
Better than the stink of MK3 
A typical RPG for the Gameboy 
Problematic yet strangely attractive nostalgic 
Hardest game in history 
Mortal Kombat 2 review 
For MK Fans Not For Casual Gamers 
This game really did not live up to the hype 
This entry fell a bit short..... 
ok 
Good System but Expect to Spend at Least $50 for Each Great Title. 
Hard to reccomend 
Interesting console 
Don't be fooled by the high ratings 
Average side scroller comic beat 'em up fare 
Decent but could have been better. 
When the computer cheats the game isn't fun anymore. 
Step 1. TURN OFF THE COMMENTARY 
Tony2 
GT Advance 
good challenge 
Not Quite As Good as It Appears 
LIMITED PLAY 
A good game but could be tweaked more 
Twisted Metal 2 still better 
Slightly Disappointed 
Do NOT buy for single-player 
why so dark&gt;?? 
Not much new but a solid implementation 
Best in the series but. . . 
Great game lacking depth 
GBA LInk Cable 
hi 
Occasionally behaves a little temperamental 
It's good 
Not quite James Bond 
NEAT GAME! Just way too short. 
Good game.  Nothing unexpected. 
can be addicting 
I Wish Better Graphics Weren't the Only Positive Addition 
Interesting and fun but pales in contrast to competition... 
Too slow 
Change my mind? 
Decent but not well balanced 
3.5 stars actually 
This game was okay 
Not my type of game 
I was expecting more from a sequel for a classic game. 
I liked Civ II a lot better 
Started out good but... 
mediocre 
Fun at times but incredibly annoying! 
Lots of changes to Civ 2 - some good some not so good. 
A bit more complicated.... 
Good but not great 
Somewhat decent FPS for the GBA 
Beautiful but not hugely satisfying 
It's early but it's not looking good. 
One of the best ideas for a MMORPG 
A good sequel for those who liked the first 
Concept is there but the game is lacking 
Both terrific and terrible. 
Great Graphics but a bit too busy 
It's good and it's not French (yet) 
You've Been Warned: Not a True RPG 
Not what the world was waiting for 
This game aint for me. 
Nice graphics shame about the game 
Nice atmosphere - tedious gameplay 
good dungeon crawl 
hey did anybody know this was made into a movie... 
How original can lucas be ? 
the pc game equal to star wars chess 
Star Wars RTS 
So Repetitive! 
Falls short 
It takes more than the Force to become a Jedi... 
a classic but probably not worth too much time or money 
Great game but some issues drag down the hype. 
Yes for the music and graphics 
A Worthy Sequel but lacking overall. 3 Stars. 
The Best of Times the Worst of Times 
Better than Gold and Silver but not by much 
Pikadissapointment 
Pokemon Crystal version-only for Game Boy Color 
Bloody Roar 3 coulda been better.....although it was good. 
Great looking but dulls easily 
A decent but thin fighter 
So So Fun for Classic Enthusiasts 
Great old games ! 
lets clear up a few things. 
It's Okay But Game Shark Could've Done A Little Better. 
Good Collection but Could be Better... 
Good variety of play Pac Man is Pac Man 
Great game but not perfect 
I only wish I could play 
Classic games...not so classic load times... 
Big title reissue draws little enthusiasm 
great rental decent buy 
A decent thrid party memory card that does what it's designed to do 
The Memory Card is for the Controller So I can save and load games. 
Its a playstation one memory card ! 
A Symbol Of A Bygone Era In Gaming 
Short but it works 
Intec Component AV Cable PS2
