A good deal but there are better products out there 
The tape is fine 
Not so sticky

Not what i expected 
Plenty more tape than you'll probably ever need. 
Great Idea but could be better 
Useful I guess... 
It works 
Okay.... 
Its a nice watch when connected rest of the time its a paperweight. 
Weirdly interesting... It works better with OpenLiveView than with Sony's software.

Interesting Gimmick 
Screen not showing

Spudger review 
Simple but effective 
Terrible case! 
This case is a very good case and very sturdy. 
Works to stop scratches but no real impact protection. 
Some good some bad 
not the worst but not worth the money 
Serves its basic purpose 
OK but lots of  Problems with Voice Assist & Recognizing Commands 
WAY TOO BIG 
FM nice listener sound quality not great 
Clear sound but some annoying flaws 
good as a speakerphone for voice but not music 
Compact quick to connect great in 35 mph or slower city driving 
Really great speakers but voice recognition doesn't work! 
Great if you want to use it as a speaker phone 
Call & Text but not so much for Android... 
OK but not great 
Ok but not as good as hoped 
Not a bad Product 
Screen protectors 
Good bubble free film for the iPhone 4S but....

GREAT CHARGER BUT CABLE DIDN'T WORK 
Works most fo the time with the iPad 3 
The cord broke down but the plugs lasting 
It was doing good until.... 
A bit touchy 
Cheap but worth the price? 
Car mount does it's job 
Disappointed 
Output is only 1.5A so it will work for phones but not tablets

Terrible ear-loop and you must speak loudly to be heard 
Great Battery but not the best 
Great technology but not for my ear.

It's an OK headset 
WTH it is an open box item missing parts DO NOT BUY FROM INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTERS! 
Not as good as the Motorola H730 
Better - but still nowhere near as clear as a wired headset 
Advanced controls but just not comfortable or efficient enough for me.

Good headset except for... 
Not For Commercial Use! 
Will update. First unit experienced serious echo issue

They sound great but they're not actually useful. 
Updated Review - Rating Demoted from 4 Stars 
Just OK 
Great Indoor Earbuds Battery Could Use Some Work 
The form factor I've been waiting for but would prefer in-ear ... 
The Jabra SPORT Bluetooth is Awesome for Indoor Usage but Horrible for Outdoor Usage 
Weak Battery 
Good Bluetooth Headset with Limited Range 
Its ok 
Easy to use and good sound quality but drops the signal and the cord sticks to your neck 
Overall: Not Bad 
Product is nice 
Beware if you have small ears or older devices 
Keeps falling out 
Poor sound quality 
Jabra SPORT - not the best 
Great Features some poor funtioning 
Conditional pass..  please read. Buy Anker or Seidio 
initially good... doesnt hold up well under long term use. 
Case does not fit the phone 
so-so 
A bit of  a let down 
Pretty Good for the Price - low quality cover 
Back cover 
You get what you paid for

Gets stuck 
White iPhone Case 
cheap item 
Basic 
Just ok - hard to apply bubbles applicator not much help 
Wrong Belkin screen protectors 
Hard to line up to apply doesn't last very long 
OK 
Bubbles didn't go away 
Pricey but works fine. 
Screen protectors 
Okay 
It's not an actual calculator.

Phone case 
Pretty but not dependable 
Crazy 
yickes! 
nice little headset 
Sound quality not up to Jawbone standards BUT TELLS YOU THE CALLER'S NAME! 
Mixed performance 
Middle of the road price and performance 
Does NOT work with iPhone 4S and Siri 
A little expensive... 
Dubious microphone quality 
Screencover 
Cheap but inferior 
Nice starting package 
Decent Range 
Holds iPhone securely good quality; required app is the weak link 
Good idea killed by bad execution. works ** ONLY ** w/ LiveAction 
Tripod feature only real benefit. 
Some simplicity with some complexity 
Like the idea needs better support (from Apple?) to be useful. 
Not as helpful as I was hoping it would be 
not needed 
Good invention with limitations 
Neat idea; limited to Belkin's photo app 
I like the hardware.  The software is not so great. 
Live Action Camera Grip for IPhone 
EASY TO USE BUT.... 
Useful if iPhone is the Only Camera You Use 
Neat concept but loses points for price and app limitations 
Cool accessory but is there a need for it? 
Not bad but not impressive for the price 
Good product hobbled by proprietary app 
The grip is great. The app...not so much... 
good functional design but unnecessary 
IOS 5 upgrade makes your volume button to act like Camera button 
Makes the camera easier to hold but doesn't add much functionality 
Cute for the price! 
Pretty but broke easily 
It's okay. 
Windshield phone holder 
Cheap 
I have Mixed feelings - case is okay but customer service is Exceptional

A little too much 
Doesnt properly fit the 4S

BlueAnt Headlock Stereo Headphones 
Unpretentious 
Premium headphone but not my type of sound 
Great case 
Tiny 
With a thiker case you need to tinker a bit 
Was expecting more!

Works with Nortel T7316 
more charge duration needed 
Good Battery 
Very stiff.

Quality Varies w/ Diztronic

Plantronics over makes good headset. What happened to this one?

Good deal for the money 
Not as expected

They are okay 
Could fit smaller heads better 
Difficult to pair 
Not as good as the Rocketfish

Poor Range! 
Too much wrong with them to justify the $30 purchase. 
Pretty cool! 
Decent quality questionable range

Late but worked well. 
Never got it to 100% 
Good Product

Worked well for a minute 
Ok 
Worked great at first...but 
Fyi 
The battery was alright 
S2 battery 
Works but doesn't seem to match the quality of my original 
It might be a great battery but the phone might be the real problem  - Sprint is no help at all 
New battery makes phone stable still degrades faster than expected 
Nothing to brag about... 
well 
It Works 
Lasted a year. 
Not the best but good price 
ok 
Same downfalls but different 
Good and Also Comes with a Soft Felt Case Plus Extra Cables and Adapters! 
Well designed could have a larger charge

Would be five stars if a lightning adapter end included. 
No flashlight?

It shouldn't be listed as iPhone 5 compatible 
Did not work with a TPU case on 
not a fan 
Fine case kind of gaudy.

Never got a chance to use 
Cheap fits great 
Impossible to take off!!!

Good for music bad for calls 
Good for music not so great for phone calls 
Good for my needs but not entirely wireless 
I like the over the ear iPhone headphones better 
Good as a Music or Computer Headset Less So for Calls 
Better controls poor call sound 
Overall very good phone calls not so much 
When convenience is more important that sound quality 
Not  exactly what I was looking for 
A solid basic smart phone with some long-term reliability issues. 
This is a okay phone. Not Great But Not Horrible. 
Very nice case for the GS2. 
Its good 
nice feel 
Fast charger 
Still has problems with iMac and high power devices

I wish this were cut to the exact size!! 
Not anti-glare nor anti-fingerprint 
Not Up to Par

Sluggish 
Random selection of screws some were dirty 
Brandon Smith 
Missing 2 'flat head' screws + pentalobes 
ok for continuous music - clicks a lot w/ inconsistent audio 
so so 
Disappointingly Mediocre 
Easy to use and easy to store - sound is good but not excellent and fit is fine but not snug or cozy 
After several months I have a review... 
The Best... and Horrible 
Wonderful headset terrible signal range. 
Beautiful and sleek but Needs an off Switch to the Sound Processing 
nice but 
ELITE FLIP isn't up to par for us... 
Nice little unit keep reading... 
Not as good as adv 
Don't buy this bluetooth 
Battery doesn't last that long and I hear popping all the time... 
helpful 
Protects your screen but edges don't stick well 
Don't stop glare 
mezza metz 
Cords don't stay in plug.

Not as good as I'd hoped 
The sides protectors were damaged not the fastest shipping for $2.99 
Black Rubber protector Phone Case 
Should have looked closer 
not sturdy enough for my use 
Nice voice command features but feels clunky and don't care for on/off activation. 
Buggy firmware installation reduces functionality. 
It could be better 
Jabra Supreme Bluetooth Headset 
I'd like it more if the software was available for iPhone4! 
Doesn't Stay on my Ear 
I prefer the cheaper Jabra Wave 
Jabra Headset Works. I'm Not Sure Why It's Worth $100. 
From someone who uses headsets a lot 
Sounds great but hard to use and fits poorly 
It Worked Great At First 
Ear piece problem...But product ok.... 
Adequate Bluetooth Headset 
DOA 
Samsung Bluetooth 
Clear but low volume 
Absolutely great... for short calls... if it's charged...

Great for navigation 
It can be improved 
Strong hold on dashboard but swivel and clamp are a bit finicky 
Hope you don't have a Nissan Altima or other similar dash style. 
Shaky and suction cup won't hold well in heat 
Doesn't fit Galaxy Note 3 with Otterbox Defender. 
Works on almost anything

A good deal but there are better products out there 
The tape is fine 
Not so sticky

Not what i expected 
Plenty more tape than you'll probably ever need. 
Great Idea but could be better 
Useful I guess... 
It works 
Okay.... 
Its a nice watch when connected rest of the time its a paperweight. 
Weirdly interesting... It works better with OpenLiveView than with Sony's software.

Interesting Gimmick 
Screen not showing

Spudger review 
Simple but effective 
Terrible case! 
This case is a very good case and very sturdy. 
Works to stop scratches but no real impact protection. 
Some good some bad 
not the worst but not worth the money 
Serves its basic purpose 
OK but lots of  Problems with Voice Assist & Recognizing Commands 
WAY TOO BIG 
FM nice listener sound quality not great 
Clear sound but some annoying flaws 
good as a speakerphone for voice but not music 
Compact quick to connect great in 35 mph or slower city driving 
Really great speakers but voice recognition doesn't work! 
Great if you want to use it as a speaker phone 
Call & Text but not so much for Android... 
OK but not great 
Ok but not as good as hoped 
Not a bad Product 
Screen protectors 
Good bubble free film for the iPhone 4S but....

GREAT CHARGER BUT CABLE DIDN'T WORK 
Works most fo the time with the iPad 3 
The cord broke down but the plugs lasting 
It was doing good until.... 
A bit touchy 
Cheap but worth the price? 
Car mount does it's job 
Disappointed 
Output is only 1.5A so it will work for phones but not tablets

Terrible ear-loop and you must speak loudly to be heard 
Great Battery but not the best 
Great technology but not for my ear.

It's an OK headset 
WTH it is an open box item missing parts DO NOT BUY FROM INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTERS! 
Not as good as the Motorola H730

Advanced controls but just not comfortable or efficient enough for me.

Good headset except for... 
Not For Commercial Use! 
Will update. First unit experienced serious echo issue

They sound great but they're not actually useful. 
Updated Review - Rating Demoted from 4 Stars 
Just OK 
Great Indoor Earbuds Battery Could Use Some Work 
The form factor I've been waiting for but would prefer in-ear ... 
The Jabra SPORT Bluetooth is Awesome for Indoor Usage but Horrible for Outdoor Usage 
Weak Battery 
Good Bluetooth Headset with Limited Range 
Its ok 
Easy to use and good sound quality but drops the signal and the cord sticks to your neck 
Overall: Not Bad 
Product is nice 
Beware if you have small ears or older devices 
Keeps falling out 
Poor sound quality 
Jabra SPORT - not the best 
Great Features some poor funtioning 
Conditional pass..  please read. Buy Anker or Seidio 
initially good... doesnt hold up well under long term use. 
Case does not fit the phone 
so-so 
A bit of  a let down 
Pretty Good for the Price - low quality cover 
Back cover 
You get what you paid for

Gets stuck 
White iPhone Case 
cheap item 
Basic 
Just ok - hard to apply bubbles applicator not much help 
Wrong Belkin screen protectors 
Hard to line up to apply doesn't last very long 
OK 
Bubbles didn't go away 
Pricey but works fine. 
Screen protectors 
Okay 
It's not an actual calculator.

Phone case 
Pretty but not dependable 
Crazy 
yickes! 
nice little headset 
Sound quality not up to Jawbone standards BUT TELLS YOU THE CALLER'S NAME! 
Mixed performance 
Middle of the road price and performance 
Does NOT work with iPhone 4S and Siri 
A little expensive... 
Dubious microphone quality 
Screencover 
Cheap but inferior 
Nice starting package 
Decent Range 
Holds iPhone securely good quality; required app is the weak link 
Good idea killed by bad execution. works ** ONLY ** w/ LiveAction 
Tripod feature only real benefit. 
Some simplicity with some complexity 
Like the idea needs better support (from Apple?) to be useful. 
Not as helpful as I was hoping it would be 
not needed 
Good invention with limitations 
Neat idea; limited to Belkin's photo app 
I like the hardware.  The software is not so great. 
Live Action Camera Grip for IPhone 
EASY TO USE BUT.... 
Useful if iPhone is the Only Camera You Use 
Neat concept but loses points for price and app limitations 
Cool accessory but is there a need for it? 
Not bad but not impressive for the price 
Good product hobbled by proprietary app 
The grip is great. The app...not so much... 
good functional design but unnecessary 
IOS 5 upgrade makes your volume button to act like Camera button 
Makes the camera easier to hold but doesn't add much functionality 
Cute for the price! 
Pretty but broke easily 
It's okay. 
Windshield phone holder 
Cheap 
I have Mixed feelings - case is okay but customer service is Exceptional

A little too much 
Doesnt properly fit the 4S

BlueAnt Headlock Stereo Headphones 
Unpretentious 
Premium headphone but not my type of sound 
Great case 
Tiny 
With a thiker case you need to tinker a bit 
Was expecting more!

Works with Nortel T7316 
more charge duration needed 
Good Battery 
Very stiff.

Quality Varies w/ Diztronic

Plantronics over makes good headset. What happened to this one?

Good deal for the money 
Not as expected

They are okay 
Could fit smaller heads better 
Difficult to pair 
Not as good as the Rocketfish

Poor Range! 
Too much wrong with them to justify the $30 purchase. 
Pretty cool! 
Decent quality questionable range

Late but worked well. 
Never got it to 100% 
Good Product

Worked well for a minute 
Ok 
Worked great at first...but 
Fyi 
The battery was alright 
S2 battery 
Works but doesn't seem to match the quality of my original 
It might be a great battery but the phone might be the real problem  - Sprint is no help at all 
New battery makes phone stable still degrades faster than expected 
Nothing to brag about... 
well 
It Works 
Lasted a year. 
Not the best but good price 
ok 
Same downfalls but different 
Good and Also Comes with a Soft Felt Case Plus Extra Cables and Adapters! 
Well designed could have a larger charge

Would be five stars if a lightning adapter end included. 
No flashlight?

It shouldn't be listed as iPhone 5 compatible 
Did not work with a TPU case on 
not a fan 
Fine case kind of gaudy.

Never got a chance to use 
Cheap fits great 
Impossible to take off!!!

Good for music bad for calls 
Good for music not so great for phone calls 
Good for my needs but not entirely wireless 
I like the over the ear iPhone headphones better 
Good as a Music or Computer Headset Less So for Calls 
Better controls poor call sound 
Overall very good phone calls not so much 
When convenience is more important that sound quality 
Not  exactly what I was looking for 
A solid basic smart phone with some long-term reliability issues. 
This is a okay phone. Not Great But Not Horrible. 
Very nice case for the GS2. 
Its good 
nice feel 
Fast charger 
Still has problems with iMac and high power devices

I wish this were cut to the exact size!! 
Not anti-glare nor anti-fingerprint 
Not Up to Par 
Comes in handy... 
Sluggish 
Random selection of screws some were dirty 
Brandon Smith 
Missing 2 'flat head' screws + pentalobes 
ok for continuous music - clicks a lot w/ inconsistent audio 
so so 
Disappointingly Mediocre 
Easy to use and easy to store - sound is good but not excellent and fit is fine but not snug or cozy 
After several months I have a review... 
The Best... and Horrible 
Wonderful headset terrible signal range. 
Beautiful and sleek but Needs an off Switch to the Sound Processing 
nice but 
ELITE FLIP isn't up to par for us... 
Nice little unit keep reading... 
Not as good as adv 
Don't buy this bluetooth 
Battery doesn't last that long and I hear popping all the time... 
helpful 
Protects your screen but edges don't stick well 
Don't stop glare 
mezza metz 
Cords don't stay in plug. 
Does what it says but nothing more.

Not as good as I'd hoped 
The sides protectors were damaged not the fastest shipping for $2.99 
Black Rubber protector Phone Case 
Should have looked closer 
not sturdy enough for my use 
Nice voice command features but feels clunky and don't care for on/off activation. 
Buggy firmware installation reduces functionality. 
It could be better 
Jabra Supreme Bluetooth Headset 
I'd like it more if the software was available for iPhone4! 
Doesn't Stay on my Ear 
I prefer the cheaper Jabra Wave 
Jabra Headset Works. I'm Not Sure Why It's Worth $100. 
From someone who uses headsets a lot 
Sounds great but hard to use and fits poorly 
It Worked Great At First 
Ear piece problem...But product ok.... 
Adequate Bluetooth Headset 
DOA 
Samsung Bluetooth 
Clear but low volume 
Absolutely great... for short calls... if it's charged... 
Buyers beware

Strong hold on dashboard but swivel and clamp are a bit finicky 
Hope you don't have a Nissan Altima or other similar dash style. 
Shaky and suction cup won't hold well in heat 
Doesn't fit Galaxy Note 3 with Otterbox Defender. 
Works on almost anything
