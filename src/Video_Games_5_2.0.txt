What was Capcom thinking? 
Butchered arcade to home conversion 
This game is bad 
The start of the best game seris ever 
Pretty awful 
Concept is good but tedious game play really spoils the fun 
Boring Game! 
*Your Connection to Westwood Online has been lost* 
banjo kapooie 
Alright 
Not that loyal to the movie 
a 2-star rating- I seriously can't give it a higher star 
Best game ever? Sure and Laetitia Casta is my girlfriend. 
Rage Wars is Better 
Maybe the most disapponting videogame sequel ever but not the worst. 
Lacks sorely when compared to previous installments 
The Most Frustrating Thing ON EARTH!!! 
Mario's first jump into the land of 3D platforming stinks

this game is so slow 
Why is this a classic? 
Adventuring ain't for loners 
everyone loved this game 
WAY OVERRATED 
A little too difficult for its own good.. 
The only thing &quot;horrific&quot; is the play control 
A party rental at best 
Boring Boring and Boring 
The incredible loading made this game not worth it 
And even more of the same...again. 
Resident evil at its worst 
Totaly Disapointing........ 
Disappointing 
Eh?

Oh so close! 
A bit of a letdown 
Command a Starship and Grow Old Doing It 
Just does not deliver where it needs to 
Torment for a reason 
Could have been much better a real disappointment 
My black box said I crashed because of graphics turbulence.. 
Still can't get it right 
Just a cheqp Starcraft imitation 
Computer crasher 
Ok... What do I do know? 
This game is just plain boring. 
Mega Memory card for Game Boy Color  an okay device 
Haven't played them yet 
Get the PC or GBA versions instead. 
Entertaining for a short period of time 
Absolutely the most pathetic software program ever written 
Gets neither the style nor the substance right. 
Only somewhat faithful to show 
Not as good as Mario Land 2 
Ugh. Why the Game Boy? 
Non-stop action with the dynamic duo 
acclaim got lazy 
Oh BOY 
Title should be called Batman \tarnished\ Forever 
The difficulty kills this game 
If you think that this is a good game then you seriously need your head examined 
For die-hard fans only 
Come on Rare I want my Country.

Where's the Plot? 
Not quite good enough 
Mediocre at best. 
The duke's first 3rd person game 
nice but

good game... but maybe not quite a classic 
So frustrating!!!!!!!!!! 
It was Boring Back Then and It is Still Boring Now.

It worked... a bit 
funky errors and frusterating camera angles 
Too Addicting 
The Best Game Beta Ever Released as a Retail Product 
God-like Micromanagement 
Tedious and Slow

Fun premise but annoying 
Awful! 
Unimpresive 
Borrrrrrring!! 
Not Surperior to Goldeneye On Gameplay

Racing Video Games 
If I wanted to watch a movie... 
Loved Ehrgeiz hated this 
Why Square?  Why?!!!? 
Going Gone! 
A very quick game one  of the quickest out for Ps2 but fun 
Lacking Gameplay 
The worst game play ever including atari 2600 
A major disappointment 
Big Letdown 
RPG??? I think not.. 
No online play...no fun at all 
Phantasy Star Online Is To The Phantasy Star Series... 
Doesn't live up to the standard of the original or BG2. 
SLOW AND BORING 
OK I guess but leave out the silly voices 
It was fun...for a week 
Be warned... 
...woah...uh what happened? 
sims house party .... 
What's New? 
Terrible 
This game needs a stake in the heart... 
This one really wasn't that great... 
minor improvement and very tedious mini games 
I will never buy another edition of High Heat. 
Cool Pitching & Batting Interface But Nothing Else 
Buy It For the Demo or Don't Buy It At All 
Sucks 
It grows on you... 
Too Difficult to Be Enjoyable 
Well it's not the game this time. 
Yuck 
Beautiful but maybe a dash too challenging? 
\You've gotta be kidding......\ 
Atmospheric but disappointing overall 
I HATED THIS GAME 
Disappointing 
Would be great but BUGGY 
So much work equals so much defeat 
Fun for the campaign game but trash afterwards 
Not for all ages 
Save your money 
Lacking... 
fun but not worth it 
Could have been the best 2D fighter on a handheld.... 
Bad compilation of some so-so games 
I know Frogger is a classic but... 
not cool 
Boring Classic NES Game. 
Controls are awful gameplay is too hard 
... 
Great concept ruined! 
Not What I Wanted 
a mixed bag 
The arcade version was fun.  This is not. 
Just didn't do it 
HUGE potential mediocre payoff = tons of fun for a 1/2 hour 
made obsolete by GTA3 but good for the youngins 
Too Much From Origonal?? (Rating: 5 out of 10- -2.5 stars) 
Significantly worse on the GBA 
The only BAD Mario game! 
gets old fast 
Offers little over its SNES counterpart 
Not A True Expansion Pack 
Great Concept Gone Horribly Wrong 
They could have made it a classic 
The Simpsons!! 
Dont Blink! 
GET OVER HALF LIFE 
Ummm . . . OK sure whatever. 
WHAT ITS OVER ALREADY 
Despite nostalgia still a poor game 
Put out first so people will buy it 
great graphics poor gameplay 
Great graphics do not make a good game 
does not compare to rampart 
Ack!  Weak game. 
Lackluster. 
You can't go home again. 
2 and 1/2 at best... 
You got half a hour 
Not a good game at all! 
Over rated 
Are the other reviewers here insane? 
depressingly lackluster! 
Achieves new levels of idiocy 
VIDEOGAME????? 
Shallow/Wimpy Central Characters 
|2.5| It has an interesting story but that's basically it 
RPG or adventure platformer? 
Didn't care for it. 
Solid game for Indy fans but ends undramatically. 
Doesn't hold up 
BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! 
Terrible 
Difficult  visually. 
Mediocre attempt flashes of greatness 
Grand Theft Spidey? 
A PS 1 Generation Game 
A history lesson not a game 
Great Games but Poor Conversion 
It's too bad 
ALMOST AS WORSE AS MK 3'S SUPER NINTENDO VERSION! 
A crummy version of a great game 
Just get MK Trilogy for PSXN64 or Sega Saturn 
REPETITION REPETITION REPETITION...  4 OUT OF 10 
WHAT GAME HAVE Y'ALL BEEN PLAYING? 
Worked after a good resetting and cleaning 
good arcade game not great 
Whay were they thinking? 
Should have just stayed with making the movie. 
Stick to the Playstation 
XXXXXXX 
This is NO Ghost Recon 
Not a good game 
Black...same old...same old thing. 
House of the Dead is better 
Caveat Emptor - this game is a disappointment! 
The More You Play the Worse it Gets 
Not as good as Civilization II 
I'll Make this short and sweet. 
Can be fun. 
Not a Sequal A re-release with New Graphics 
Civilization Weak 
Disappointing 
Beware Buyers - Best to wait awhile on this one 
The sorrow... The emptiness... 
Creators need to lay off funny tasing water... 
Fun for a while then gets really B-O-R-I-N-G-! 
Sorry But It Just Doesn't Cut It 
What a terrible piece of slop 
Gauntlet 2002... but much less fun than the original 
Oh gosh were back to gay stuff. 
Not that worth it :&lt; 
well well... 
Jedi Nighty night 
This game is pretty pour 
Could have been so much better 
What a joke... 
ha ha 
Totally Upset 
Gameshark Faulty/Buggy 
This major bull... 
Lameshark2 
Two great games! Poorly emulated for PS1 
Maybe cool for a day 
Not Really Good. 
Wasn't compatible with my TV.  Sent it back 
Poorly shielded 
Just plain did not work 
Did You Like the SNES Version? 
A bit dissapointed 
It's a BIG step backwards
