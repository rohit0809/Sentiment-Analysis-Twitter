Disappointed 
Initially fun quickly forgotten... 
Repetitive Annoying Not Much Fun

This may work better as a baby toy but... 
A dud 
Sadly unimpressive 
This COULD HAVE BEEN a great product... 
Not the best crafting tool

Ugh what a bad product! 
lost potential 
Do not get this for your child 
Not a hit at our house 
Love the mat colors too faint (If you don't have the box keep instructions to get markers!) 
Colors are very light 
If you get good markers this would be a nice set. 
Great idea but flawed markers too light. 
Markers don't work 
Great concept that falls short 
Crayola where's the magic? 
Not Enough Saturation 
As a set this is flawed but here is a fix.

Stick with the Innotab 2... or LeapIt this year 
Skip right over this tablet!

Cheap Flimsy and Comes with Only One Wrestler 
So-So Toy 
don't bother with \frame game\ -- looks like fun but it's impossible to use as directed 
I just don't see the point where's the storage box? 
Couldn't convince anyone to get into the game 
Rather Disappointing 
A sad shadow of a great game. 
No box! If you like to store your games in neatly stacked piles this will drive you nuts! 
Not Worth The Money 
Fun and then abandoned 
Not essential messy gimmicky cartoony 
Like noise?  Get used to it if you buy this! 
Not much too it. Does not link up to our other hot wheels tracks.

Looks like a cool idea but not really working well 
Disappointed 
Poorly done

My Kids Were Not Very Impressed 
Not well made 
The idea was cute but.... 
Julius will go down the short slide and that is the best I can say about this lame and unimaginative toy 
If you have money to waste 
If it ain't broke don't fix it - not a real improvement on the original Rubik's cube
