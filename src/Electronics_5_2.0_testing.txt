Make sure to test your CDs - high failure rate 
Check every one after you burn it 
May contain scratched CDs 
Change for the Worse 
Probably works - if your phone line is static-free 
Works barely at really short distance and initial setup was a pain 
Clear Reception While it Lasts 
Stiff For Petites 
CRAPP BISCUIT 
Nice sound short lifetime 
You Get What You Pay For

Fell apart after a few uses 
The felt tip died within 20 cleanings

Broken within a week 
Good way to scratch your lenses

Built to break. 
About as bad as the other reviews say. 
Buy the Sony version instead.

Very tight fit poor audio good for books 
Junk 
Uncomfortable.  Cheap quality.  But hey what would you expect for that price?

Virtually Useless Headphones 
Too tight off center and not big enough for an adult.

mal producto 
Stereo or not? 
Works ok but analog tuning is a pain 
Do not be fool by the Sony's name! 
Too much channel drift 
Watch out not all channel available 
Tripod screw doesn't fit some cameras 
It is truly a \quick connect\ but it separated from its base and I'm no longer using it.
