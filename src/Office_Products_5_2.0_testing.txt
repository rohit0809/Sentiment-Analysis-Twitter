The first 10 months it worked fine - UPDATED 
Disappointed. 
Binder with a Nice Grip 
Really not worth the trouble 
Nice unit but a defective cartridge ruined the experience 
Computer interface has few options and labels are low quality

Hardly replaces gift wrapping! 
Redundant 
Very short life even with minimal use 
Smooth delivery of ink but still globs. 
Comfortable but splotchy

Broke in five minutes

Portable and Poorly Conceived Scanner 
You can't pick your frame color; looks cheap 
Cheesy cheap 
Not Well Made

these are huge! 
I have to agree with several other reviewers on this one! 
Takes up two sheets of paper 
Unimpressed--not professional quality. 
Cool but  limited usefulness 
Major Setup Problems and No Paper Drawer 
There are better options than the MX 432 
Canon Pixma MX432 is not 1200x2400 dpi scanner 
Long term peformance issues;  scan has limited options and forced a USB connection... 
I'm staying away from this brand. 
Disappointing beyond the photo printing capabilities 
Nice Try but too much noise

Not too impressed 
A competent printer with horrible support 
Just Okay

Assembly Required is An Understatement 
Kind of disappointed 
Overpriced annoying chore 
Not what I was hoping for... 
Not much ink. Good quality 
NOT EPSON ORIGINAL CARTRIDGES!!!! 
Ink is fine packaging terrible 
Why advertise that you can print postage from this wireless printer when it has to be hooked up via USB to do so? 
After three months it stopped printing correctly 
Almost Worthless 
Just cardboard really? 
Not Sturdy Enough To Be Useful 
Flimsy and unattractive... I threw mine away. 
Glad I Didn't Have To Pay For This 
Plain cardboard box that's way overpriced. 
Cheap cardboard file box 
It's a box 
A Basic Box (if it worked) 
I am disappointed with this 
A $10.00 cardboard box? 
Buy it and I think you'll be disappointed! 
Flimsy. 
Box seems sturdy at first but collapses when full of paper - definitely not worth the price--it's a cardboard box... 
Pointless by itself and not really much more than a cardboard box 
Cannot recommend.. 
I was expecting something more 
Overpriced 
must be a government job 
Useless! 
Redwelds are better than this 
Overpriced flimsy doesn't do what it claims 
Not worth paying that much for 
Not a strong product 
Good Idea with Big Problems 
The box it came in was sturdier . . . 
Colored cardboard file box that is nothing to write home about 
Folders- functional but not very sturdy. 
Expensive 'starter kit'... 
Organize your price comparisons before purchase 
Nine file folders 
If You Enjoy Getting Ripped Off Try These 
WHY? 
Too Expensive 
Basic filing starter kit charges a premium for generic life suggestions 
flimsy 
Overpriced and I actually tore it putting it together 
Lackluster... 
Too Expensive for a Fancy Cardboard Box 
Not Something That I Would Recommend

Not So Useful 
Don't waste your money 
New tool to learn 
Disappointing; Didn't Really Work for Me 
Destroyed my wrapping paper 
Promises To Be An Essential Everyday Product But For More Limited And Specialized Use 
Very limited applications 
Worked the first couple of times 
Worked great until the first time I dropped it 
DON'T REMOVE THE PLASTIC! 
Safe but very low quality. 
The Unkindest Cut.... 
Edited: this cutter didn't last 
Mixed Metaphor = Mixed Success 
Doesn't cut it 
Shredded funds 
Not recommended for Mac users - driver issues with wake from sleep 
Problem with power draw on print startup 
strong awful smell 
Luxurious Feel But Minimalistic Design Compromises Comfort 
Don't understand the purpose of these

I'd Skip It 
Misleading Description and Photo 
Attractive but not durable 
Picture Misleading... 
Not like the picture 
Had issues w/jamming buckling of staples inside 
Cute but difficult to operate 
Just about everything is wrong about this product! 
Esthetically Pleasing but REALLY Cheap Stapler 
Pretty but cheap 
Darn 
Attractive 
Good Luck Getting Rid Of Apps 
Spend A Few Dollars More And Be Happier 
I wanted something that would create great photo prints - this isn't it - adds lines to the print 
Good as long as you don't use windows 8 or apple 10.8x 
Poor ease of use destroys an otherwise solid wireless all-in-one 
It's okay but.... 
It was working OK until a paper jam 
Can't recommend it. 
I seem to have been unlucky enough to get a faulty piece 
Some quality and toner expense issues 
Not ready for prime time printer 
Good Ticket Stock Poor Templates 
Needs better design options and heavier paper 
Quality tear-away sheets; terrible and non-intuitive template design 
NON-INTUITIVE TEMPLATES AVAILABLE ON-LINE ONLY 
Confusion 
Expected better from this brand. Disappointed

I don't get it 
Beautiful colors but nib sticks and ink smears 
Bold colors but disappointing overall.

Not compatible with the other disc notebooks 
did not work with epson nx330 
You get what you pay for 
Almost complete garbage

Beautiful Sluggish and Clumsy 
Not so fast 
So Far . . . No Good 
Scanner Error... 
Do NOT get this if you do scanning 
Snail pace picture printer 
Get the 545 instead 
buggy not intuitive not worth the cost of ink 
Nice solid little office or home office printer but can't remember date/time 
Not as easy to set up as I had hoped 
Good printer except for its very inefficient ink cartridge system! 
Doesn't Like Printing Photos on Photo Paper 
Excellent Printer Good Price 
Unusable? 
Just not for me... nice print quality but poor design and materials in my opinion. 
A little slow and loud; heavy too 
Way Overpriced Yet Decent Ink Cartridge 
Overpriced 
A Tale of Two Printers - and Two Different Levels of Customer Service 
Not A Good Mid-Back Executive Chair 
Excellent size but that's about it 
The ink cartridge issue overrides the positive aspects of this printer! 
Get what you pay for 
A Rare Miss for Pilot 
Nifty idea but not premium enough for the kind of people who care about notepads 
Weird 
Could be better 
Better in theory than practice 
Mediocrity 
Firmware Error in chip 
A pen is a pen is a pen 
This pen delivers the ink...but broke after a couple of weeks. 
Pilot Remains TOPS sorta 
If you're upside down in the rain... 
Floats writes when wet... just like a cheap ballpoint pen. 
I don't get it 
Not impressed 
Sharpens poorly 
Broke after a week 
Very Fast Sharpener that Lives a Faster Life 
It gets the job done sometimes satisfactorily. 
Poor Performance when compared to a Panasonic cordless phone connected to the same OOMA (telo) base unit 
Latency is a real problem...

Fun Idea With So-So Implementation 
Prints nicely BUT... 
Didn't work for me 
Do Not Pass GO. Do not collect. 
Poor quality scan 
Not So Super 
Needs to Come With Eraser 
Wish They Had Included Eraser 
Sharpens unevenly not much of a point 
laughably bad security 
Not effective for what it is inteded for 
Weak tape 
Not Going To Be Useful For Most People 
not for packing and shipping 
Unimpressive and poor for shipping 
A Scotch Tape That Seems Like A Good Idea But Offers Marginal Usefulness 
Ok for loaners .... those who don't return your pen! 
Pilot makes the best pens but not these.. 
Decent design but limited wireless range 
great idea mediocre execustion 
Too expensive and complicated 
Ridiculous 
Not impressed 
I found a better alternative 
Fits a Specific Audience Maybe

A clever idea but out of date 
There are better and less expensive alternatives 
I Don't Get The Purpose Of This Product 
Don't quite get it

This or a plain photo? 
Did not care for...

Too Clunky - Tries Too Hard 
One 'not very useful' box 
Dead bug in my box.... 
Means Well But Cheaply Made 
Nothing stands out. It's a pick-off-the-shelf dollar product 
it's colored scotch tape 
Not a replacement for decorated Duck Brand duct tape. 
Wobbly as heck! 
The magnets all popped off 
Over priced for limited usage

Flimsy and photo prints are of poor quality 
Cheap and warped 
Flimsy

Very light duty 
Not well built 
I Don't Get It 
Not very functional 
Not enough contrast 
Cheap 
Meh.  (I know crazy 'cuz how hard is it to make a 'meh' cork board?) 
The cork part is fine 
Cheap-looking cork board that cannot be hung only mounted with sticky tape that may not adhere to surface 
I guess you could call this an \off the wall\ review 
For those of us (you) that have nothing to do&#8230; 
Uses a Monday - Sunday set up instead of the more common Sunday - Saturday 
Calendar Begins with Monday. Ugh. Major Flaw for Month of March. Horrible Marker! 
Two serious flaws. 
Too small for family use. 
Very unfortunate. 
Don't even bother 
Love this type of board but this one has some flaws. 
Not terrible for the price but a few things make it hard to recommend.

Plastic covering feels cheap thin not heavy-duty 
Okay but not Wowed 
Poor quality 
Quality leaves much to be desired 
Consider the price carefully. 
One is just as good as another right? 
The utility of this is much in question. 
Looks OK but not that great functionally 
Organizher

By Far the worst item I have ever purchased online 
Really Not Useful in the Stores 
If You Use Quicken You Don't Need This 
A waste of paper 
Not useable by touch typists probably OK for hunt and peckers 
Only 4-10 sheets not 20! 
Too expensive not sturdy 
REVISED for your FYI! 
OK stapler but usless without staples 
Okay As A Throw Away 
No staples included but the skins are cool 
not good 
Just get a regular stapler and avoid hassles. 
Stapler is very low quality small and jams often.  Skins are cool but prefer ugly and functional to beautiful and frustrating. 
Heavy! 
Handsome Ballpoint Pen With Squishy-Soft Stylus Tip 
Seems Pricey 
Works... sort of 
Eraser Is One-Half Inch of Felt on Velcro and Does Not Stay Attached 
Overpriced cheaply made 
Buy the Markers Separately. 
A strange eraser but OK markers 
Good pens eraser & caddy are a waste. 
So much potential horrible product 
Audio quality problematic 
Canon MX532 Wireless Office All-in-One Printer 
Good Printer Bad Wireless 
Constant paper jams 
Prints are beautiful I'm just not in love with the design 
Impossible setup 
The rings might be heavy duty but not the binders 
Setup and software subpar 
After The Nightmare Wi-Fi Setup You Still Cannot Scan Remotely! How Absurd? 
Plastic Legs 
Updated: Padded Back Doesn't Stay Affixed 
Fast but not sharp 
4 out of 5 is a sign of over-reaching 
not particularly user friendly 
Color me frustrated - no template! 
Pretty Labels That You Can't Print? 
Multi-purpose but too bulky 
Super bright and functional but battery installation is a PAIN 
Big pain to change the batteries! 
Way too much work putting in the batteries 
Basically a disposable light good enough for what it is 
Not satisfied 
Not Worth the Price 
Disappointing 
Defective when received. 
Good but not impressive and with issues.
