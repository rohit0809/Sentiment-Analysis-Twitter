Opening The \Doors\ 
HiFi Buff 
This is a review of the mp3 download of THE DOORS 
Clean sound but a little disappointed with the surround treatment 
It's the rim-shot baby. 
They did get much higher... 
Don't Buy the MP3 Version if You Want the Full Remix! 
When the music's over rerelease reshuffle repackage remix and remaster it 
A normalized recording that sounds neither analog nor emotional 
radio edited! 
James \Jim\ Morrison was not \all that\ 
Should have purchased the non 40th anniversity edition 
The best and the worst 
Not bad... 
Another L.A. Woman 
DVD-Audio version is decent attempt 
An uneven but worthy finale 
Only for Hard Core Doors Fans 
Attempting the dignified exit 
Over-Rated 
I don't agree with the current conventional wisdom. 
5 Star Album 1 star for stereo remixing 
Nice album maybe if you were there at the time you might enjoy it more 
Not Impressed 
ohmygod! it's Pet Sounds. wuptifreakin'do 
A Bridge too Far 
Not a Beach Boys fan...but 
it's rated over  Revolver? 
NEW STEREO and MONO REMASTERS! Unfortunately a big disappointment.... : ( 
Over Hyped 
Looks like I'm swimming against the tide but whatever 
Nice beach music 
anticlimatic at best 
Not judging the music but the DVD Audio edition 
not even top 10 of 1966 
#2 on RS 500 ..its good but.. 
Disappointing release 
It's good but terribly overrated 
Album is 5 stars DVD-Audio is 1 Star DTS 5 STars 
Wouldn't It Be Nice...? 
Important yes great no. 
NO NO NO. 
why pet sounds REALLY isn't the best album of all time 
Pet Sounds 
I wish I could like this more 
You must be joking..... 
Unusually strong for 1966 but less so out of context 
&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; surround mix basically 4.0 
it wasn't a certified million seller in part because of 
Influential and important? Sure. Great? Not so much. 
In the Eye of the Beholder 
Dated 
Mastering just OK 
Sorry America..... 
Groundbreaking = Yes!  Masterpiece = No! 
Concept? 
Essential Jazz Album for Your Music Library! 
Gorgeously tired 
MP3 album problem! 
Good but not the original Endless Summer. 
Very Good Beach Boys Pre-Pet Sounds Compilation Now In MLPS Format! 
very good CD but it has its weak points 
Bad remastering but Brilliant album 
The follow up to Endless Summer 
A good album but not my favorite 
Some great songs/Some safe for the supermarket 
Time and The Nick of Time 
Her big breakthrough 
Pompous Flatulence Abounds 
Over-rated album from the BRILLIANT Jethro Tull 
Somewhat Inconsistent 
The memory 
I need to explain 
The sound is duller-- 
Aqualung Still Treading Water (for me) 
STEREO? 
The Zombies Greatest Hits 
The Theme gets the 3 stars! 
Should have read the reviews before I scooped this one up 
Oh The Thin Line Between Big Band and Elevator Music... 
Not So Firm 
Could Be Better 
If you like Dr John its OK 
High quality commercial jazz fusion 
Poor Sound Quality 
Glorified Elevator Music 
Bad Shape Vinyl 
Light Years.... 
Has Some Worthwhile Moments and KILLER Bonus Tracks 
Behold Other Chick First 
A mixed bag.... 
Good Instrumental Defintion But Middle of the Road Melodies 
Nice acoustic guitar smooth jazz duo 
Good Fun 
A review of Spyro Gyra's Three Wishes. 
Thankfully not \smooth jazz\ but could be edgier at times 
Well done perhaps but rather too \smooth\ for my taste 
no wes 
Run from Your Stereo 
Okay 
Old skool Rippingtons 
This Was a Gift 
Man has she improved! 
I recant - Ms Krall is a real artist 
An almost good record marred by marketing desire 
lesser than the sum of its parts 
A little too slick not enough composition 
Okay CD 
Best contemporary Benson in a long time but... 
So-so 
A review of The Rippingtons's The Best Of The Rippingtons.

Found her! 
Just Hits Me Wrong 
What exactly was I expecting? 
Just Doesn't Fit 
Not One of My Favorite AKUS Albums but Still Laudable 
This has flaws yet with a gem or two or three... 
Didn't Connect. 
Pretty good certainly not their best 
All have done much better work; buy their solo work instead 
Tracy and Irma great combo. 
In search of the lost Arkestra 
Average Raffi Average Christmas song 
Strange duck 
It's growing on me

A  Combination of the Two 
Good and a half 
Dated Movie 
A Few Good Songs On This Album 
1+2=3.5 
Interesting but can't hold a candle to Jimi Hendrix 
For those who like to be yelled at. A hardcore classic!! 
Good value for the money I spent 
A little tedious 
Half Good 
Live Set (LIVE) - Michael W. Smith 
nice Christmas cd 
What's Missing? 
This is not a 5 star album 
All songs sound the same 
Enjoyable from beginning to end. 
Solid but not remastered for whatever reason. 
80's pop female singers ruled! 
For The Fledgling Flock Fan a Fine **First** Listen! 
Well if this is all a fan can find... 
Sorry to admit this-I didn't give this CD a decent chance! 
A solid collection of material 
Haircuts and Attitudes 
If music be the food of love play on! 
Essential 80's Rap Music (3 Stars) 
Boring... 
there's better short dog out there 
Good Songs but not a full album to me. 
old school 
Good 
Not as good as \Samantha Fox\ but probably better than most anything else that she did 
Wounded Bird does it again--which is not a good thing. 
Hasn't Aged Well 
Huh? 
kind of disappointing 
20th Anniversary Remaster But No Elephant Stone 
KRS already made an album called Blueprint first........... 
Not one of his bests 
With some missing tracks this cd would be outstanding 
More Jazzy Rap 
Mix bag 
The first half is good... 
She co-wrote a few of her own here 
Not bad but not good 
Old School 
Grits from Kid Rock 
Definitely Worthwhile

Promising 
Seems to revolve around one single but still pretty good. 
Wow It's actually listenable. 
No Man's Land Is Where They Ended Up Sometimes (3.5 Stars) 
are y'all sure that THIS ALBUM isn't their DEBUT???? 
An Evolutionary Step for Short Dogg 
Has hits 
Another Decent CD but a bit weaker 
THIS CD IS NOTHING SPECIAL. 
Weak but not worthless 
Album \#10\ maybe my least favorite of his 
A dope album if you haven't heard the first three 
The Fall off begins................ 
The end of an era 
This CD is OK. 
I feel like I'm re-writing my Hanson review. 
A group for today but not for posterity 
This is ok 
good pop album 
Could be better... 
One side of the story 
O.K.ALBUM BUT NOT AS BAD AS THEIR 2ND ALBUM.. 
Rapper's Ball 
Tight CD 
ENTERTAINING

A Solid Effort from the god of Hip-Hop!! 
All That I AM-Big Will's Review 
It bugs me when songs don't seem to have a point 
Funky Metal-edged Alternative Disco-dance rock ...?

richard & linda have done much better 
Two great tracks 
Touches of levity Compelling love songs Dazzling guitar 
Solid supplements 
The last album.... 
I want to like this I really do. 
Has its moments but is easily surpassed elsewhere 
watered down Toure 
Pleasant but FAR from compelling collaboration 
10% Tibbetts 90% Choying Drolma... 
Contractual obligation? 
I like the title song the best. 
Packaging? A Greeting Card? 
Solid if uneven effort from the Thompsons 
FINE VOCALS BUT ORDINARY SONGS FROM SANDY DENNY 
Continuing a Tradition of British Folk-Rock 
Beautifully Disturbing 
Not sure what all the fuss is about. 
Precious. 
Weakest of Drake's work but still powerful. 
Bryter Layter 
classic - dated 
UNOBNOXIOUS... 
I Expected More 
Pleasant Listening 
Still ethereal but the beginning of the end. 
Sorry - but lame... 
incredible... usually not this time around! 
Nowhere as good as Wee Tam 
A Classic never fades 
I Looked Sideways 
Best Of/Rarities mixture 
Love the band  like the singer 
Never having heard the album... 
This has turned out to be a very meaningful cd 
\Just Play The Melody\ As Jackie Gleason Said 
Average Cd Vocals uninspired untill 11th track 
Well-crafted 
Good but too edgy for me. 
overrated 
Not my Bible 
The recording or the performance? 
Great Performance but not what it advertises...... 
5 out of 6 
Soulless 
Blues and more Blues 
Noteworthy! 
No friends it isn't plausible.

A nice collection of BIG hits BUT 6 obscure fillers added. 
Good singing forgettable tunes 
The Direction Begins To Wander 
Stately sung soul 
Better than Low still a lot of crap. 
Second of the Berlin Trilogy Now In MLPS Format! 
Experimenting with the sound- Not always successfully but never less than interesting 
This album is a paradox... 
Nice sound some excellent songs but still disapointing

More historical than essential 
Only for fanatical fans. 
A nice snapshot but... 
Interesting Live Performance! 
The first All-Starr Band 
Good Music But An Unnecessary Purchase 
A pretty screwy live disc but passably entertaining 
The real hits are good! 
3.5 stars 
Ship's a goin' down ship's a goin' down... 
Picks you up just to knock you down 
Disappointing and Bizarre 
Don't think I get Big Star

Alright but get #1 Record and Radio City first 
Uneven performances and bizarre moments on 3rd BS album 
simple renditions 
Melodious to My Ears 
On an island 
Unrealized potential....

More fun from 'little' Elvis 
A disappointing follow up

Far from `Copper Blue's' magic but still good 
Loud pop songs 
A voice of dissent

John and Yoko's Wedding Gift To The World. 
One of the worst recordings I've  heard. 
Dave has a devil's advocacy streak sometimes 
This Is Not All That Bad 
A Conventional Effort From An Unconventional Artist 
Both pop and jazzy with a very articulate directed Yoko 
Onowhat was I thinking 
I Beg To Differ 
The most difficult Ono CD for me to critique 
A bit dated 
Mothers 
This time Zappa's sense of humour works against him...

Interesting to a point 
The Crazy Re-done versions 
Whats wrong here? 
Mural's wedding. One song drags it down though.  65/100 
A strange collage 
Better things had to come after...this is the starting point 
For Experienced Zappa Fans and Fans of Musique Concrete Only 
Okay 3.5 but no choice for that 
Good 
pretty pretty? 
A question 
5 stars for the original vinyl 3 stars for the CD edits 
Remixed bad original nice! 
two or three good songs- skip the rest 
This 1987 Remix Unpacks the Fruit 
Would be great as a single-disc album 
3 stars and 1/2 is righter and suitable for this US Classic 
Pretty But Vacuous 
A difficult album to like as a whole 
Disregard all reviews written prior to 2012 
Rzzz Quoth I 
WAY WAY OUT THERE-- EVEN FOR ZAPPA 
Not Essential But You Need It To Complete Your FZ Collection 
Weasels Ripped My Flesh 
Eclectic is good - if you like the range of styles 
wow surprisingly average 
Not essential 
Great fun shame about the recording standard 
Shut up and Play your guitar? 
Not a great FZ album but it has its moments.... 
Perhaps the first rock opera! 
My Least Favorite Zappa Material 
Sublime Guitar Solo 
Flo & Eddie #2  Is Still Entertaining But One Of The Weakest FZ Albums!! 
Strange.............but good. 
An O.K. Album 
Billy Eddie several vegetables bad breath and child molestation? 
Great!  ...if you are a teenage boy 
I was at the concert. 
Farewell Flo & Eddie....You Won't Be Missed.....Enough Is Enough 
Is anyone else having trouble with the CD 
A bit overdeveloped 
3 stars and 1/2 is righter...another classic!! 
Three out of Five... 
classic songs - mediocre album 
Not A Classic 
Need to work on providing a quicker response time to customer inquiries 
okay 
Some good stuff ... 
Not as good as it's made out to be. 
3 stars and 1/2 is righter.. such a remarkable tour!! 
a weak effort with some quality moments 
BUY THE VINYL!! 
Amazing varied Zappa guitar textures. Great Bozzio drums. 
mwah... 
good and a half 
A classic masterpiece BUT 
Soft/Hard/Hard/Hard...But the soft is 25 minutes of an LP! 
Who is making those new brown clouds? 
Great Demo Disc but... 
Annoying vocal makes this inferior to original but true to Zappa's vision 
Ruined by the vocals 
Another good late 70s 
No it's not 
For Zappa completists only (which isn't a bad thing)... 
Is this Frank Zappa mucking around a few good tracks... 
The best and worst of Zappa... 
Shlockingly good to shockingly good 
not essential 
Are you hardcore? 
Good But Also Points Out The Crux Of The Biscuit 
Bitter self-indulgence with some exceptional tracks 
Some good stuff here 
Reaction to previous reviews 
Too specialized for entertainment purposes 
The Music Is MUST HAVE ZAPPA - but the item was not in the shape described 
Compelling crossroads 
Not for Zappa music and composition fans 
Contains Zappa's insufferable \hit song\ but also some more substantive music 
none of the above 
Love and hate 
Not as bad as it's reputation suggests. 
Some great songs to fill in a 'Worst of Zappa' album 
Not his best 
non-essential but fun 
Not one of Zappa's best but worth 9 dollars 
For most people not essential 
My first exposure 
Get The Vinyl--the CD version blows. 
Kind of Suprising that the quality was not really there 
Music great; recording awful. 
What kind of FZ fan are you? 
hmm... 
A classic? 
A Good Zappa Instrumental Album....part orchestra/part synclavier 
I *love* Zappa but this is not his best work 
Contains some good stuff despite the in-organic sound 
Good Zappa though not great... 
By Zappa's standards it's actually a 1 star album (2012 remaster review) 
Synclaviered Classical 
This  was  a  joke  really 
Who really gets this one? 
A curiosity 
Good and a half 
synthetic 
A rather lackluster live Zappa compilation album from the 1980s 
Difficult..... 
CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION... 
Can't Wrap My Brain Around This One... 
Very clever - but almost no soul 
for fans only 
Some good stuff but mostly forgettable.... 
good and a half 
One of Zappa's few mixed bags.... 
Typical 1988 Zappa...not necessarily a good thing 
Ignore the lyrics and you have a good album 
For completists only 
Eccentrock 
A flashback to the 1970-71 Mothers 
Zappa's 62nd release - get the other 61 FIRST 
Flo & Eddie Era Mothers' Music And Dialog Plus John & Yoko 
A \Must\ For Zappa Completists: Contains 2 Treasures 
TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT PERFORMANCES 
You Can't Do That on Stage does it better 
Historical Archive-Prelude to 200 Motels 
Tracks 1-9 3 stars...The rest is 5 stars 
OK but not as good as the others 
Mixed blessing 
Strictly Commercial party-record edition 
Overrated 
GOOD BUT ALSO SLEEP INDUCING 
I dunno... 
Barry's always worthwhile but not one of his best. 
Okay 
Delux Rancho Delux

David Bowie Meet The 80's...... 
Sorry but I can't stand it! Oh well I couldn't...

GOOD STARTER BUT................. 
A Fitting Title 
Greatest Hits!  How? 
The Most Known Unknown 
&quot;Best of...&quot; well not exactly. 
Rock and roll blasphemy? 
Good Debut and Well Remastered! 
The Concert Is The Highlight-Also Has Different Mixes 
Good but hardly perfect... 
Who's On First 
Exuberant Nerd-Wave 
OK 
The beginning of the end really 
Not that good really 
There's Better Elvis to be Had 
Too much touring and booze! 
Looking Back 
Moments of Brilliance Hampered by Dated Production 
Like sex and pizza even bad E.C. is still pretty good 
Poor Napoleon's Waterloo 
Ugh... 
Great Release But Not So Great Bonus Material 
Better than you remember it 
Not EC's best but has its moments 
One Classic but all worth hearing 
Nice try but this doesn't cut it for Costello 
OK for starters  but somewhat one-dimmensional 
An absurd concept... 
The Best? 
For die hard fans 
For the casual fan. 
The problem with Zappa's stuff... 
A one-sided look at Zappa's career 
Peaches...but NO REGALIA 
Sad album 
Fascination with the abomination 
Bob Mould's post-Copper Blue project. 
Nice parts but loud booms are awakening!!!!
