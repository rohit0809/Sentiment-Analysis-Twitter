not like the photo 
Shelves failed after just 6 months 
Vey Cheap material. 
Works but... 
She outgrew them in no time! 
It Does Work But Not Worth the High Cost 
heard great things but didn't work for us 
Not really a miracle 
Not the miracle I was hoping for 
Need to manipulate baby too much to put this on; disrupts sleep 
These just didn't work out for us.  Too easily foiled. 
Not safe for bigger/active babies 
Worked for Two Weeks 
Loses Out to Kiddopotamus 
Baby hated this! 
Not Snug Enough 
This requires patience 
Didn't work for us 
Not a miracle for me 
Not a fan! 
No miracle for my Houdini! -but friends love it 
Expensive and easy for baby to break out of 
Miracle Blanket 
So cute but not so entertaining 
Used to like it... 
Disappointed in the weak play yard panels 
tears easily 
It's stiff as a board! 
Good idea but doesn't fit. 
Mold! 
Pros and Cons 
poor execution 
It's okay. 
Check your faucet first! 
Nice product but really not universal 
Works well but breeds MILDEW! 
Let me tell you how much I hate this product. 
Hello mildew 
faucet cover 
Not soft material 
Flo water deflector. 
Cool design but has some kinks 
Mildew stains won't come off 
Missing animals and duplicates of others 
Cute but unsanitary 
Bland not exciting and drafted for traditional mom-dad 2 parent families 
Disappointed 
Don't like 
it's ok 
Cute but very very tight 
Too big for what it says 
Might work for some babies... 
Not sized properly 
Flawed 
Too small!! 
No stretch baby never got to wear it 
Bigger than anticipated 
This product is cheap 
Velcro doesn't support very much weight 
Sounded great! 
Spend a little more for something better 
more difficult than I anticipated 
Too hard 
makes a mess 
Didn't like the lid 
does not work for my son 
Not a great design; easily removable lid. 
Didn't work for us 
Waste of money time and food! 
Better options available 
Lacking compared to similar snack cups 
Nice thought but doesn't work 
does not really work 
the lid wont stay on 
Only used them once or twice and now they sit in my cabinet... 
Disapointed 
Not so much 
eh 
My son has never liked these 
Pretty crappy quality nice idea 
Doesn't spin 
Great idea badly executed 
holds water until the flimsy plug fails 
May be fine for some... 
Don't love it... 
Ok for newborn. Unsafe for mobile babies. Tub tips over 
Imse Skimps 
Probably not worth the price 
Not the item pictured 
Nipple too small for breastfeeding baby 
Worked for about a month now LEAKS EVERYWHERE! 
Gets the job done but not easily 
Caution for older babies with teeth 
Great in theory if there is a toilet seat it actually fits 
Doesn't stay on toilet rim 
One of those things that sounds good but... 
spring for the elite 
It smells you just get used to it over time 
Beautiful from the outside 
Stinks 
Spend an extra ten to get the Elite version 
Not worth it 
Works great but could be less flimsy 
Cheaply constructed but gets the job done. 
Light weight plastic and not tall enough 
Didn't last long. 
Encased in crinkly vinyl 
Fits the Da Vinci Emily crib perfectly but doesn't hold up to light use. 
After one year of using it's cracked. 
Good for Grandma's house 
\Kit\ is incomplete 
Not impressed! 
not great..... 
cleans easily but gets moldy 
Don't bother selecting a color... 
Too easy for Baby to Remove 
Not sure what all the great reviews are about... 
These are OK... But NOTHING compared to Baby Bjorn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Never really fun 
Cute but also not a kid favorite 
Not his favorite

Eh... I threw it away after the second use 
Very small and hard to clean. 
terrible product. 
Neat idea not for fruit however 
Nice idea but impossible to clean 
Much better ones available! 
Strong smell of plastic. Paint is persived as toxic and no details on packaging regarding plastic contents. 
Great for the first few weeks then moldy on the inside 
Watch for mold 
Strong smell painted parts are sticky 
son didn't care for this 
The one thing our baby didn't chew on... 
Save your money just go to the grocery store & by a baby toothbrush. 
Sorta Pointless... 
Baby likes it-helps back teeth...but risk of choking-watch out! 
Wish it didn't have a timer 
NOT Loud Enough!!! 
Better to just purchase a track from itunes 
Thanks for waking my kid up... 
Very frustrated with this product 
Did not work for my child. 
Not useful for a light sleeper 
Malfunctioning 
Super Cute but no white noise sound! 
Not worth 
It Didn't Help My Daughter Sleep 
Not all that its cracked up to be 
Better off with a musical mobile 
If its so great why am I on my 4th one in 9 months? 
Wonderful idea...but imperfect execution 
Dose not work great 
Do not wash 
Did not wash well 
Very bulky 
can't see my baby 
Too thin 
Paint comes off 
Inaccurate but cute. 
thermometer  isn't an accurate gauge 
The words don't disappear 
Far Too Sensitive to Heat 
This duck thinks that ice cubes are too hot to handle 
bath toy 
Cute idea but if you trust \hot\ notifier than you'll always take cold baths 
Doesn't function right 
Just use it as a toy. 
Terrible thermometer fun duck 
An OK toy only 
Water got trapped inside 
Just okay 
Dissappointed.. 
didn't work for us 
My baby didn't fit on it :( 
Comfortable but too tight at thighs

not for tubby babies no weight/size guidance on the packaging 
Not my favorite product 
Doesn't work 
Dont waste your money! 
It was not match my bed 
Okay Rail. 
Difficult to keep in place 
Returned it 
Not a good match for latex mattresses 
OK but there are better 
STRONG CHEMICAL SMELL!  No way is my child sleeping on this! 
The support strap is too tight 
Must have gotten a dud 
Easily ripped off 
It didn't fit my crib at all.  Not even close 
May not work well on modern cribs

Small Small Small 
**~~Savy'sMOM~~**

My daughter is not interested; pricey 
MORE FRUSTRATION THAN FUN :( 
Two Stars 
Not for me. 
Removed the Cup Holder from the Stroller 
to heavy 
Great brush but DEFECTIVE 
Don't waste your money 
Ok but there are better swaddlers 
Nice but unnecessary 
Don't put this in the washing machine 
Not as great as it sounds 
Great Idea but MILDEW! 
Smells 
Don't know whats so much fuss about 
Doesn't last 
Quit working 
Worked okay for a while although it sometimes needs ... 
It's just a thermometer without the safety 
slow to show temp change and broke after 5 months 
Originally gave this 5 stars now it's 2! 
ok at first 
Broke quickly 
Not accurate 
Almost... 
Works but beeps FOREVER 
Broke in less than 7 months! 
Didn't turn off very fast for a while and now stopped working! 
Slow 
Dr Brown's Drying Rack 
Don't use with glass bottles 
Extremely complicated disappointed 
Confusing and messy 
Huge! 
Too small 
impossible to open 
Too hard to get separated 
expected more with Medela branding on it -  it barely does the job intended 
Doesn't hold battery charge well 
Didn't work for me 
Boppy was much better for me 
This was a waste of money for us your experience may vary 
I wish it were not made out toxic polyurethane foam 
It wasn't very useful 
don't like it 
Don't buy it!!! cheaply made foam got strong toxic smell 
Would not recommend this product 
Great for only a second 
Eye pleasing but... 
not for me 
Easily pops 
Leak during first time use 
Good While They Last...But They Don't Last 
cute..but daughter didn't like 
Cheap and uncomfortable 
Not a favorite

Music sounds bad 
Agreed on \not so musical inchworm\ comments 
Merely Colorful. And forget about \music\ 
Boring for six-months and up 
Eh... 
Lame and boring 
Not so good 
I don't get the whole hype with these Lamaze toys?? 
This toy is overrated.... 
Not that interesting 
WAY TOO LOUD! 
its ok 
Hard to squeeze! 
no big deal 
Not a fan of this toy. 
Baby doesn't really like this 
Would do waste your money 
Terrible Packaging 
Cute but pointless 
Not great 
Socks fall off 
SO DUMB 
Used these for 2 days 
Poor sound and wrong material for feet 
Material used is a bit on the weak side 
Where's the sound??? 
Great Idea But Needs Improvements 
Didn't fit 
Seemed like a great idea but baby isn't interested 
He dint like them 
Babies didn't like them 
Rattle hardly makes any sound - Socks hard to put on 
Not as cool as we'd hoped... 
4 month old not interested 
so so 
doesn't have water-trapped sides as pictured 
Returned.....I guess it was defective? 
Just doesn't live up to the original 
Underwhelmed - The aquarium swing was better. 
Toy Bar Broke Right Away 
Made my daughter cry 
OK 
I Don't Really Love This One - Could Be Better 
Regret buying this thing.. 
These didn't work for me 
Cheaper to hire a baby sitte 
FANCY! But... 
Wish it did the basics better 
Great but...... 
I had high hopes... defective motor and unhappy baby 
Way too fast for a newborn 
snugabunny swings better 
A baby girl must have! 
Cuter but not as useful as older models of swing 
Worked great... For about 4 months... 
Please think twice the speeds are crazy 
Absolutely Not Worth the Cost... 
Could Be Better 
pictures flake off 
Maybe maybe not 
Didn't work for us - returned it 
Don't waste money 
High hopes little results 
So so 
Very large 
Waste of money 
Definitely wouldn't buy it again 
Looks Cute but BAD quality! 
Poor quality

My child loves it - but the quality is mediocre at best 
Dog-toy Squeak! 
Waste of money. 
Neither of my two children use it 
Do Not Understand the \Crazy\ Over Sophie 
Lots of hype - my son couldn't care less. 
I wouldn't buy it. 
My son does not like it 
not as good as everyone says... 
I did not buy it and I won't let my baby use it.. 
My child chewed off the foot and spots 
Good but not worth $20 
Eh. 
looks like a dog toy 
Not bad. Not so great. 
whats the crack? 
Loud squeak--keep this friend out of the crib during naps 
not worth the $ 
Just a teether 
Daughter could care less 
Hyped up 
New in box paint coming off horns. 
My baby couldn't care less about this. 
Beware contains latex but otherwise a great teether 
sooo overrated 
Not worth it 
I think it's cute my baby not so much. 
just eh. 
Great Toy but Potentially Hazardous 
hmmm so so quality..... 
Pretty Lame 
Really Pricey Organic Dog Toy 
Don't know what the fuss is all about 
Before you buy this... 
Not for some babies 
Great for your baby....if you don't have a dog too. 
Glorified squeeky toy 
Cute but not as practical as it should be 
Really cute but neck broke after minimal use 
Not impressed 
Started Leaking after 2 washes 
Adorable Print Diaper Feels Cheap 
Expensive non tub and sling

Hurts son's mouth 
Interesting Teether - worried about the shapes 
my baby chewed pieces off of it

Too heavy for the crib going back 
Disappointed 
Not worth more than $25... 
wish I would have paid attention to the reviews 
Can't Use if Your Top Rail is > 3 & 3/4\ 
Doesn't fit the crib and freezes 
Motor failed after a while 
This is is just okay

Not the greatest 
So cute but has some problems 
Not what is says it is 
Get the deluxe version! 
Not good. 
Too flimsy

Small Potty Opening 
Cute idea but safety features backfire in function  :-(

Flimsy and hard to open 
Complicated. 
Waste of time 
Should have returned... 
Overrated 
Sucks...not in a good way 
Pass 
Suction mediocre lids ill-fitting 
no stick only one lid?! 
Suction cup foiled by an 8 month old 
Lids stay put bowls do not. 
The cover of mid size one does not fit well 
Suction sucks.

Does not suction 
Okay but suction doesn't work anymore (did it ever?) 
SUCTION DOESN'T LAST 
Doesn't hold up to use 
wanted to love this bag but it's not great 
Found one we liked better. 
Try something else first. 
can only hold bottles & cans not soda cups 
it's ok for some strollers 
Negative reviews were right on point... 
nipples leak 
Nipples still leak. 
VERY noisy!! 
Good idea but...

Bad Design 
Only for newborns 
Not sure of the benefit... 
Colors were misrepresented 
Awkward design makes it difficult to sit on 
Hard to use 
Cheap product 
Very meh.

Good price for something that breaks in 1st month 
Lightweight. 
Not that great 
FIRST YEAR DRYING RACK 
Too flimsy and falls down too quickly 
Do not buy if you have glass bottles 
Meh it takes up too much room on the counter. 
Not worth it. 
Slippery 
Great unless your baby is a super sucker 
Flow not fast enough. Nipple collapses too easily restricting flow. 
Served its purpose...twice 
Flimsy. 
Too flimsy and snacks rolled back into baby's lap 
Slants back on my child 
Good idea not well executed 
Waste of money. 
parts missing 
This is ok not great.

Not worth it. 
Don't buy this product

My baby + this cup = LOTS of clothes changing & mopping! 
Top collapses 
Leaky and spout collapses 
Leaks leaks leaks! 
Not so good 
More like a lovey than a bunny 
Cozy and cute but not organic and it unravels a bit 
Cute but that's about it

Ok walker iffy bouncer 
Disappointed with the photo here 
Too thin 
Doesn't really work with Chicco seats as stated 
Love this stroller BUT... 
Leaks galore! 
Way too much trouble 
Some good mostly bad. 
Leaks something awful! 
PRO: easy open CONS: reassembly of straw..... 
hard to clean... 
Functionality OK but design is ridiculous 
only ok 
ok 
granny style / leg holes too tight! 
Not for use with babies with nipple confusion/preference no cover 
Not Orthodontic Better Options Out There

Mattress does not lay flat 
Not Powerful Enough 
Would Return if I could 
Not impressed 
Sucks Up Milk!!  Not Worth The Money$$ 
It really is gross! 
just ok 
pick something else 
This is not a good spoon for a baby who is just starting solids 
Food stays on the spoon... 
Falls out of shallow bowls and flips over 
Designed to flip out of any jar you sit them in! 
Baby likes it but it's top heavy 
Handle too heavy 
Too heavy 
Not our favorite 
Not good 
Not my favorite 
For older children 
NOT SOFT TIP! 
baby teeth scratch plastic 
Just \eh\. 
tossed these 
Doesn't stay on spout 
TOO BIG TOO EXPENSIVE 
Doesn't fit our tub spout! 
10 month old still too short for this 
Toys? What toys? 
Could be different for others 
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE?? 
Made for Parent Not Child 
Four month old seems easily frustrated by it

Listen to the reviews- Just buy items separately 
Not so useful as looks 
Too big for the pak n play... 
very loose 
Not the best but good for the price 
Good pillow 
to big! 
went from 4 star to 2 
Highly Disappointed - Too Ex$pensive For Discomfort 
Teether 
Heavy & Bulky 
Great concept but kid hates it! 
Great concept poor performance! 
Good idea but not as practical as I had hoped 
Their product developers thought this was enough power? 
Not sturdy at all 
Wish I'd read the reviews 
Eh 
Angle is too uncomfortable for the baby plus the belts are too short 
Easy to use but not comfortable for baby 
Too many annoyances for something I use every day. 
Love the seat hate the stroller 
Stroller isn't worth the price 
Save your money and go straight to a convertible car seat. 
Bulky and cumbersome 
Great for playing not great for packing 
hmm... 
No suction! 
Not for long term...Limited lifespan 
HORRIBLE!  Designed by a man I'm sure.  Buy a Medela. 
pretty useless 
Poor quality 
Great concept poor execution 
Not the Greatest 
Didn't Need 
Waste of money 
Expensive nightlight! 
Was defective/broken upon receipt BUT great customer service 
Never Used 
Really not necessary 
Didn't use 
Whats all the fuss about? 
Better options out there 
Pen and Paper vs. Itzbeen Baby Care Timer.  Pen and Paper wins!  Here's why... 
I used it as a clock 
Very hard to use 
A Decent Product But Unnecessary 
Our Least Favorite Potty 
Door knob covers: no challenge for your toddler! 
Works good but is a pain for adults 
Can't find a good set! 
Prob works for some doors but not ours 
Keep looking better knob protectors out there 
Order only one package to test if they work on your doorknobs 
okay product 
Use your own tape if you buy this. 
Poor adhesive 
Wish they had more stick to them 
Good Product Idea but some practical issues. 
Didn't work for us 
Tiny strips of tape not up to the task 
Much smaller than anticipated 
Don't stick 
Not double sided tape???? 
They don't stick 
Needed reinforcement 
Tape sucks doesn't stay on 
Doesn't stick well 
Ripped the paint off my wall and my child pulled them off upon discovering them 
Maybe I put it on wrong 
Booooooo! 
nice concept but not ideal for baby 
Flat nipple not loved by newborns . 
great concept but no likey 
Not Great 
Need to be bigger 
Impossible to open 
Not compatible with Medela 
It's Okay... 
Haven't catch one bugger! 
Just ok 
BPA Free but poor design.  Better BPA-free options if you look 
Leaky 
Could not get rid of plastic taste 
Spouts are too hard! 
Disappointed 
The Cost of Being Lazy 
Unstable felt cheap 
Child needs to be bigger for us to be able to use this. 
mold collector 
Did not work for our 12 month old 
2 stars because it will hold a pacifier but that is it 
Would you really put your baby's pacifier in this? 
Waste of money 
Comes unsnapped 
ANNOYANCE pain in the bottom... 
Product does not fit into travel bag 
Not much comfort 
I wish every day that I had bought a different highchair 
Hazardous for young children which is the target audience! 
Flimsy wire and sponge on bottom 
Not durable but you will use less soap with this brush. 
Sponge End wont last long 
not recommended 
not long enough for my water bottles and very flimsy 
Decent Bottle Brush 
The metal neck broke after 4 mos. 
Fragile brush 
Does the job! 
Not too impressed 
One of the only \misses\ from Dr. Brown's 
Too bendy 
You'll have to replace often 
Flimsy bottle brush - top sponge shreds quickly bristles don't reach sides of bottle 
Didn't last. 
I wanted to like this... 
Overly complicated and uncomfortable. 
Great idea hard to use 
Entirely too complicated 
Just not the right product for me 
Comfortable... but inconvenient 
I tried... 
Like the moby hate the color! 
Great wrap but not for heavier babies 
Complicated and uncomfortable 
If you live in a warm climate not so good. 
Thought it would be great but not so much 
Not useful 
Too complicated 
Takes to long to put on properly. 
not practical 
Great idea but... 
Not my favorite baby item 
Not a fan 
Baby Didn't Like It & Confusing 
Love the idea of it but doesn't stay 
Useful but makes leg holes too small 
Not really useful 
I don't get it! 
Difficult to Attach 
Always a struggle to keep the tray on 
Seems like a waste 
It's fine just not for me. 
Bag breaks down quickly 
Hate the Hassle of VELCRO! 
cute but does not work 
Novelty only... 
Save your money - use a washcloth or cloth diaper 
Cute but doesn't work well 
Will lose suction from smaller shields. 
Not well thought out design 
Not worth it. 
Never stays on 
BPA free but doesn't last -- only good a few months -- loud constant squeak 
Not for larger babies 
Frustrating assembly cheap hardware bad packaging 
bad buy 
Can't open the stroller up anymore 
Poor quality 
Leaked 
does not keep food warm 
I'm giving up on these 
Disappointed 
Hard to put together and very leaky. 
Leaky Cup 
Soft but just didnt' fit 
Flimsy 
Thin and not so good quality 
A bit disappointed. 
Very thin 
Doesn't Fit Graco Pack N Play Well 
Too thin and barely fits 5'' mattress 
Great until washed 
Just fit after one wash 
This is a play yard/pack n' play sheet. 
Seem normal but they don't fit our pack'n'play 
Like Trying To Put A Full Size Sheet On Queen Mattress 
Material is a bit flimsy 
Doesn't fit well on pack n play 
Looks flimsy and ecru color looks more like a butter yellow instead of a cream/wheat color 
Seams 
Terrible 
Cheap sheet 
Does not fit Bjorn travel crib as reviewed 
Doesn't fit my pack n play properly 
Too small 
Disappointing 
Not great 
Awful smell... 
Fits 3\ deep NOT 5\ deep mattresses! 
They both shrunk!!! 
Too hard! 
Cute but didn't wash well on 1st wash 
Not impressed 
Cute BUT.... 
Cheaply made basic sheet.  Nothing special will not last through many washings or several kids. 
pretty cheap 
thin and see through. just like a very cheap t-shirt 
Shouldn't have skimped on elastic... 
Wouldn't recommend 
Shrunk when washed as recommended. 
Very small 
Not the greatest 
Better off getting disposable liners 
Not Great. 
beware: not a liner but an add on 
Diaper Bag or Cooler?! 
strap broke! but love wallet compartment! 
Doesn't work as advertised 
At least knock a few bucks off for an older version. 
meh 
Cute but broken 
I wish it was softer 
Great Fitted Sheet an  great price BUT FOR A PLAYPEN NOT CRIB!! 
Shrink 
Not easy to use 
nice ideal not good for my guy 
Baby hates it 
Horrible instructions 
A bit misleading...not a gate 
No need to spend the $$ 
Works ok but there's a much cheaper solution 
Waste 
Great but not dishwasher safe 
Avoid the frog - go with the monkey or other animals.  Frog design doesn't work. 
Didn't fit well. 
I prefer the Medela Harmony 
Works ok (with much effort) but can't stand the squeaking 
Epresses Milk well...but squeeks WAY too much! 
uncomfortable 
I couldn't make the magic happen 
It's fine 
ok product 
Cheaply made...didn't like.

Heavy 
Too difficult to use and not comfortable for baby! 
Just okay. 
Useless if your tot likes to eat at the table 
Didn't work for our squirmy toddler 
Ok for what it is 
Cheaply made for the price 
Amazon baby fail. 
Watch out - the two halves snap together forcefully 
Ugh...I hate this thing 
I don't like this tub because... 
Not needed! 
cute but not worth the money 
Not very well made 
Get what you pay for 
All The Reviews On Here Are True 
Functional but not made to withstand travel 
Impractical 
Not as described and my child just destroys them 
Static City 
Inconvenient product does not identify level of flow on nipple itself. 
HORRIBLE Quality Assurance 
It may be water proof but... 
Didn't work for us 
Not molded at all 
Doesn't make sense 
Doesn't stay down 
Gave it away 
Not for us 
Great idea but disappointing performance 
Should have listened to the other reviews 
Not great 
Won't stick to anything but glass tabletops 
Think twice 
Useless gadget

Better than trying to stuff sausage with a chopstick but only just. 
Cheap plastic won't last 
Does the job but takes a long time 
Works great... when it worked 
Pasta: Art or Science 
Surprised and disappointed 
Either does not age well or needs periodic maintenance 
Lasagna Yes Fettuccine No Spaghetti No 
Is it the right size?

Taste Fine.

Good looking pencil too small though. 
Cap and pencil body color don't match 
feels like fake ones

Not a big fan 
Do It Yourself Hanging Folders? 
Good product 
OK at first but lots of issues!

Slow cranky low image quality scanner. Very limited usability especially on Mac OS X 
Too hard awkward with thin keyboard. 
Unbelievably uncomfortable 
Not the Best One Out There 
Terrible but better than nothing 
Stick with the ordinary staple remover or your fingernails 
Very well-made but a bit clumsy 
I find it difficult to use 
This One Doesn't Cut It! 
These are definitely \stick needle fine point\. 
Great idea but one fatal flaw. 
Traditional dispensers are better and cheaper 
Cutting tape is not rocket science 
Good concept but made for small hands 
Works ok but cumbersome + single-function 
awkward to use 
Useful maybe but not necessary 
Might Fail in Direct Sun 
UNSATISFACTORY 
Uncomfortable... rest is too hard 
Only For The Very Basics 
Not secure enough 
Am I missing something here? 
A cheesy version of self-sticking envelopes 
Uhmm... I can still read my account number 
Not tamper proof. 
Good envelopes but not as advertised. 
This is Not a Security Envelope. 
Just another ordinary envelope with \features\ 
Not the best I've used... 
FAIL! 
You don't have to lick them but... 
Why? 
Just okay--I would not buy them again. 
Neat concept for envelopes but more glue and darker ink are needed

Very Unstable Drivers on Vista 
Not as good as this one! 
Buyer Beware

What Can You Do?? 
Overpriced. 
HP black ink teeny supply 
Stiff and hard to work with 
i find the shape odd 
Difficult to access quickly 
Glue separation left a big buckle in the whiteboard 
Too large

Disappointing 
Don't recommend 
Just Another Poor Multi-Line Cordless Option 
Caps get lost easily 
Most definitely not \strong bold color\ 
Won't replace my 5.8 Motorola! 
Don't buy it for the speakerphone 
Decent features for the price - not sure about the quality though... 
Maybe handy in a pinch but no substitute for learning the language 
Not Ready For Prime Time 
Inexpensive But Cumbersome Interface 
Updated review and one less star 
Seems slow to get \to the point\ 
Though its seat cushion is very comfortable it still lacks adjustability options 
Very good quality but made for taller people 
Not worth it 
Not allot of ink

Misleading product name 
Misleading and overpriced

A little misleading... 
It is actually USD 5 of postage - the USD 45 is only on subscription 
Sturdy unit---see update please 
labels stick in printer 
Nice Printing Scanner Died Just Out of Warranty 
As bad as it gets 
Might actually try the satisfaction guarantee for these \Permanent\ labels

Dotted Line is not aligned with perforated tear off point 
Did not stay put for long

The Neon is just glaring 
Not as good as Avery brand labels. 
Pretty good 
thin... 
didn't like them 
Too tiny to be useful 
Doesn't fit automatically 
Marginally adequate 
good but some issues 
Templates are not available on post it site 
Same old Idea 
owie! 
Avery PocketTabs - OK For Storing Papers and Cards Insufficient For CDs and DVDs 
shame on them for releasing it like this 
Would not purchase 
This isn't my favorite 
Plastic post it 
What's the point? 
A product looking for a good application 
These NoteTabs seem to have a limited purpose 
Mystery tabs! 
\Just one word:\ 
I get it but don't know who would use it 
Limited usability 
No Thanks 
Concept not well executed 
Mac Support? (Not Office) 
Not worth the cost especially for occasional use 
Wasteful 
I like my bigger PaperPro Stapler better 
Cheap and complicated to use 
Construction a bit \Cheap\ 
Works For Awhile 
Not the worst printer I've ever used but it is close 
Strictly average 
Anybody remember the 1958 movie \The Fly\?

A solid design...if it wasn't an inkjet 
Unsatisfactory 
Certain features missing 
Misleading and confusing price structure 
Static and other noises in the line! 
Very very thin 
Right size too flimsy 
Streaky printing 
Don't last dry up quickly bleed through and smears 
Ink are not well marked

A Total Waste of Money! 
Why re-invent the notebook?? 
Not as nice as the picture indicates 
Good idea but lacks a lot of thought 
Adult trapper keeper? 
Narrow Use. Not Impressed. Cannot Combine with a Paper Planner System. Large Bulky \Organizer\ Doesn't Hold Much. 
Too Rigid and Bulky 
There are better options available 
Well it's big. Useful? Not so much. 
disappointing 
Works OK for my PC Recovery Kit 
An expensive attempt to reinvent the notebook 
Decent for a small project or for a very specific purpose 
Nice theory- but fails in execution 
Good size and storage but insufficient cushioning 
Used with an HP Envy 17 
Not very good flow 
Decent introduction to numbers and math 
The actual stories are not helpful.

Unstable ink-guzzling inkjet diva 
Noisy to the Max... 
Interesting concept but... 
Excellent for Taking Closet Space 
An Interesting Idea Hampered By An Uncertain Execution--A Footrest I Frequently Kick Out Of My Way! 
Broke after a few uses! 
It's a footrest with a fan? 
Not all that useful 
Not necessary 
Sorry Kodak but your printer firmware and wireless are problematic 
eliminates a problem that does not exist 
Basically functional but quality isn't great -- noisy 
Gimicky 
Great idea falls short on some finer points 
I Appreciate The Effort but Not the Results 
Sorta comfortable but slowly slides on my chair mat 
I thought I'd like this but it's not for me 
Hard to assemble not high enough 
pointless? 
Disappointing colors 
Need to SCRUB to get it off the white board 
Not very good 
Just Ok 
Not impressed at all 
Doesn't sharpen evenly. 
so-so because the well for shavings is too small 
This pencil sharpener is great 
Doesn't perform as well as marketing would lead you to believe 
In my opinion: Meh. 
Not worth the price. 
O.K. but not for classroom use 
Relatively okay 
Saves space but don't like how it sharpens!! 
Not very good. 
Didn't work for my purpose 
Dissappointing

Not that great even for the price 
Couldn't get it working 
Useful in some ways... not so much in others 
Way smaller than they look 
I wouldn't buy this not likely to last long 
Kind of crappy actually 
I can't imagine what you would use this for. 
It's Cute and it Works But Not Worth $16 
Not as cute in person! 
Fun design but not sturdy 
Great if you enjoy filling landfills. 
Fun but not Functional 
takes up too much room 
Just ok 
Why? 
A product we do not need. 
What was wrong with regular scotch tape rolls? 
This product made me angry 
Good concept but does not work! 
A Product That Serves No Purpose 
strips come out bent 
Not so useful to me but it works 
Overrated. 
Not that useful 
pop up tape 
Annoying to use 
Nice idea execution could be better 
Poor predictability severely limits usability; Seems widely OK for very short usage 
Not As advertised 
If Something Sounds Too Good To Be True.... 
Lets go when you aren't looking 
Does not hold well and takes off paint 
first use and it didn't work 
Not exactly what I hoped for 
Total Crap 
Early model that needs more tweaking! 
Just another thing to need to buy refills for... 
Great for Cards and Scrapbooking! 
I'm mixed about this product... not good for children! 
loser 
be careful where you use it! 
Not Really Reusable 
Funky double-sided tape 
bummed 
High hopes but disappointing 
Generally disappointed.  Tears paper only VERY light material stays put. 
I really wanted to like this... 
My small clock fell off the wall 
Holds but doesn't release well

Hardly a great item for teachers 
Only OK 
Edited review 
Relatively thick note tab but poor adhesive 
Coverall

Dry erase markers write well but stain the white board 
dull color and the orange doesn't erase 
Laptop Post-It Dispenser? Really? 
Disappointed; Looks Like a Product in Search of a Market 
Idea is ok but holder is flimsy 
Not Worthy 
Another 3M \Why\ product. 
I think I could live without them and still have a rich rewarding life 
Interesting idea but no. Not for me. 
If it ain't broke... 
no positive point 
Slightly Cumbersome 
A Pretty Basic Holder for Fanned Post-its 
Cute idea in theory but impractical... 
Poor Design but Great for Reaching the $25 Free Shipping Limit! 
Destined for Big Lots stores 
Only Partial Design Success 
Not really necessary 
Not useful for heavy users of post-its 
more of a pain than a help 
Interesting concept but clumsy and disappointing 
Surprisingly less than what you'd expect for what it costs.... 
Good ideas in need of refinement... 
A great idea but the reality was not so great. 
I am so disappointed 
Disappointing experience 
Don't believe the picture 
Not Up To Kensington Standards 
TErrible Dry Erase Board. 
Wish they were better 
Did not handle stains 
Divy It Up 
does not work as intended 
It's not good enough for me. 
A great way to get you to buy ink cartridges 
One stays the other falls.  Low price = weak magnet 
Not too good 
Using to scan textbooks for school - Update: has issues! 
It only takes one bad cartridge... 
Good price but tears easily. 
More \hand friendly\ but not the best tape.

Very flimsy 
Flimsy and no perforations

Pretty useless for skunks

Not what I hoped for

Interesting Gadget 
Another weapon in the War Against Deer. First impressions not good.

banjo kapooie 
Alright 
Not that loyal to the movie 
a 2-star rating- I seriously can't give it a higher star 
Best game ever? Sure and Laetitia Casta is my girlfriend. 
Rage Wars is Better 
Maybe the most disapponting videogame sequel ever but not the worst. 
Lacks sorely when compared to previous installments 
The Most Frustrating Thing ON EARTH!!! 
Mario's first jump into the land of 3D platforming stinks

this game is so slow 
Why is this a classic? 
Adventuring ain't for loners 
everyone loved this game 
WAY OVERRATED 
A little too difficult for its own good.. 
The only thing &quot;horrific&quot; is the play control 
A party rental at best 
Boring Boring and Boring 
The incredible loading made this game not worth it 
And even more of the same...again. 
Resident evil at its worst 
Totaly Disapointing........ 
Disappointing 
Eh?

Sega goes bye-bye 
Sega finally gets it right...but too late 
Stinks like his brother 
I'm in complete shock 
Addictive with good graphics but not much of a plot. 
Terrible game

One sixth of the game is okay.

Not my cup of tea. 
Good looks awful gameplay 
Disappionting 
A fun shoot'm up. 
NewPort 3rd Party Generic Super Nintendo Controller

Great expectations greater disappointment!! 
Alright not the best Maxis game out there... 
Uninspired

Nothing compared to Quake. 
If N64 tresspassed onto Dreamcast.

One of the worst of the series 
Worst in the series get final fantasy anthology instead

Hope you have an ass kicking machine 
WHAT DID YOU DO ID?! 
a lower than ok game 
Not The Rayman We All Know And Love 
Spine tingling story line.  Mind numbing play...

Too hard to control buggy 
A victim of it's own realisticness. Way too dark. 
Another Sub-Standard EIDOS game 
Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation

And I thought it was going to be good... 
Blizzard gives birth to another bad egg

OK but could be way better 
Typical of Origin 
What should have been a great game 
Much the same 
Star Trek new worlds 
Oh so close! 
A bit of a letdown 
Command a Starship and Grow Old Doing It 
Just does not deliver where it needs to 
Torment for a reason 
Could have been much better a real disappointment 
My black box said I crashed because of graphics turbulence.. 
Still can't get it right 
Just a cheqp Starcraft imitation 
Computer crasher 
Ok... What do I do know? 
This game is just plain boring. 
Mega Memory card for Game Boy Color  an okay device 
Haven't played them yet 
Get the PC or GBA versions instead. 
Entertaining for a short period of time 
Absolutely the most pathetic software program ever written 
Gets neither the style nor the substance right. 
Only somewhat faithful to show 
Not as good as Mario Land 2 
Ugh. Why the Game Boy? 
Non-stop action with the dynamic duo 
acclaim got lazy 
Oh BOY 
Title should be called Batman \tarnished\ Forever 
The difficulty kills this game 
If you think that this is a good game then you seriously need your head examined 
For die-hard fans only 
Come on Rare I want my Country. 
How is this supposed to be fun? 
A disgrace to the company the title and the genre

Where's the Plot? 
Not quite good enough 
Mediocre at best. 
The duke's first 3rd person game 
nice but 
Batman license + Mortal Kombat influence = a digitized mess 
Batman still tarnished forever even on the SNES! 
A near-bust 
Not as good as I thought 
Not really my thing but I respect it as a classic 
good game... but maybe not quite a classic 
So frustrating!!!!!!!!!! 
It was Boring Back Then and It is Still Boring Now.

Painfully difficult 
There's some good and more bad to this game... 
Dissapointing 
Remake of the original 
not much fun 
My least favorite of the Metroid games. 
Too hard to be fun or innovative 
Frustrating 
Call me crazy but I don't like it 
Not very good. 
a real wipe out 
Beware of this system 
Decent but cheap as hell. 
WTF? 
Bo-oring! 
Sonic Labyrinth 
Sonic 1995 
Old school.  Like PacMan type old school.

Could've been the greatest game ever but 
An original take on fighting games.
